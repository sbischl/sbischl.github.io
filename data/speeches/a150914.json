has been recovering, growing in the first half of 2015 at an annual rate of 2.4 percent.", "This pace is slightly below the yearly average of the previous two decades, and is held back by at least three drags.", "The first is a slowdown in industrial production, which has resulted mainly from persistent contraction in mining, dominated by falling oil output.", "Second, the manufacturing sector has been deterred largely by a deceleration in U.S. industry in 2015, affected by another severe winter and declining energy investment in the face of significantly lower energy prices.", "Modest Mexican manufacturing activity is in line with less vigorous exports to the United States in spite of substantial real peso depreciation.", "We expect these factors to be transitory and momentum for Mexican exports to pick up once again.", "Third, domestic spending has remained tepid, as indicated by damp investment growth and a measured pace for recovering private consumption.", "The main weight on domestic spending does not seem to come from the labor market, where unemployment continues to drop and labor force participation remains stable.", "Nor does it seem to stem from a lack of domestic

possibilities in oil extraction, as well as opportunities in natural gas transportation and electricity generation, among others, provide for tantalizing potential investments.", "Inflation and monetary policy Monetary policy in Mexico has been guided by the priority aim of attaining price stability, which, within an inflation-targeting approach, means a permanent objective of 3 percent annual inflation.", "The conduct of monetary policy has taken into account the cyclical phase of the economy.", "In the last two and a half years, the policy interest rate was cut by 150 basis points to accommodate sluggish economic activity.", "After some price pressures in 2014 coming mainly from tax hikes, annual inflation in 2015 has remained on target, even reaching historically low levels below the objective.", "This achievement is noteworthy, given the fact that until only a few years ago, Mexico had a long history of high and unstable inflation.", "Therefore, it is imperative to consolidate the record, recognizing that price stability demands continuous attention to prevent a reversal of the trend.", "Some factors call for vigilance.", "Recent performance has been aided by positive shocks such as favorable base effects related to last year's tax hikes, the elimination of domestic longdistance telephone charges, and slower increases in energy prices.", "These phenomena may prove ephemeral.", "Peso depreciation has not affected inflation much so far, and the impact has been concentrated in durable goods.", "This may not be the case going forward, especially if the weakening of the currency becomes amplified.", "Additionally, in spite of current unprecedented declines in inflation, survey expectations for the medium term are stable but above the target.", "This may reflect a perception that work still needs to be done to solidify the good results.", "Price stability will not be secure until mediumterm inflation expectations are firmly anchored on the objective.", "The Bank of Mexico expects inflation to remain around the target in 2015 and 2016.9 Nevertheless, upside risks should be monitored, especially given the possibility of secondround effects.", "Continued significant peso depreciation, negative supply shocks, and eventual aggregate demand pressures are among these risks.", "Concluding remarks Let me conclude by saying how much I

human capital resources.", "Mexico currently faces challenges both on the international and domestic fronts.", "The best way to deal with them is by cultivating long-term economic growth prospects, notably through well-implemented structural reforms, and buttressing the macroeconomic framework, including monetary policy.", "On that note, inflation this year has reached historically low levels.", "This achievement requires consolidation for Mexico to reap the full benefits of permanent price stability."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
