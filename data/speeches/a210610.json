at our modest deputy level - to launch this conference, we were convinced that the message of the Green Swan was worth spreading, but we were far from sure that it would attract such a prestigious set of speakers.", "This was before the new momentum we are experiencing thanks to the political shift in the United States, following the ambitious Italian G20 and UK G7 presidencies.", "Now, only a few months later, the context is quite different.", "Governments are more aware than ever before, that they need to act, to anticipate; there is more appetite for multilateral cooperation.", "The private sector is making many commitments to net-zero emissions.", "However, a number of questions arise that we cannot answer easily.", "Three of them seem particularly Should we focus on climate change or broaden the scope?", "How can we make sure that public policies are consistent?", "How to thrive within limits?", "Allow me to develop these points.", "The Charter of the NGFS,4 adopted in December 2017, states that the network aims, in particular, to \"contribute to the development of environment and climate risk management\".", "It is key to consider how ecological crises are in fact multiple and interconnected.", "For instance, the 2019 UN Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)5 reminds us that human activity caused a catastrophic decline in Earth's biodiversity (e.g.", "the current rate of extinction of species is between 100 and 1,000 times higher than the reference rate of the past million years).", "More recently the Dasgupta review6 in the UK states how severe the risks linked to biodiversity loss are and how complex the interactions between human actions and nature are.", "The scientific community actually tells us that these ecological risks are interconnected and should not be addressed in silo.", "For example, the concept of One Health developed by several international organisations suggests that human, animal and environmental health are interconnected and can only be addressed jointly.", "In its final declaration of the Global Health summit in Rome (May 21), President Mario Draghi stated:7 \"The Rome Declaration rightly emphasises the importance of pursuing a One Health approach -

firstly, the interactions between monetary and prudential policies with fiscal policies; - secondly, how central banks can facilitate the international monetary and financial coordination needed on climate change; - and, lastly, how central banks can contribute to promoting values and behaviours that are particularly important for the low-carbon transition, such as long-termism.", "For example, climate change is now at the agenda of the G7 and the G20 finance Tracks where representatives of finance ministries and central banks work together.", "New forms of cooperation between the public and the private sector have emerged as well, such as on the very important topic of disclosure: -

that it is too late and we are doomed, or that we should stop doing everything we do: travelling, innovating, creating, and so on.", "Living within limits doesn't mean that we will not keep investing in innovation or that some economic sectors will not keep growing.", "In fact, some sectors, such as renewable energy, must grow if we are to meet this century's formidable ecological challenges.", "- that technological innovations and breakthroughs will eventually solve all our problems, and that we will not have to profoundly change the way we live.", "Some technologies may not materialise quickly enough to prevent uncontrollable and irreversible environmental changes from happening, and solutions that do not rely strictly on technology may also be needed.", "Focusing only on the climate challenge, for instance, reducing energy demand is critical to achieving ambitious mitigation.", "Therefore, even though technological innovation is crucial given the magnitude of the task upon us, we will also need to learn frugality (for instance by limiting superfluous or conspicuous consumption), as Pope Francis' Encyclical recommand us for example, or - if you prefer - a form of self-restraint, as emphasised by Professor Dasgupta in his review on the Economics of Biodiversity.", "Moreover, while technological innovations will still be crucial to decrease our use of energy and resources, they may not always lead to more production and growth.", "Widespread use of electric bikes for urban transportation, for example, could reduce our dependency on individual cars in urban areas, but by the same token it could also dampen growth prospects in the automobile sector.", "Likewise, technology makes it possible to organise various meetings online rather than have participants travel thousands of kilometres, but a diffusion of such norms could also translate into less growth.", "My point here is not be exhaustive, but rather to show that framing the debate in simplistic ways (e.g.", "by opposing techno-utopians and techno-pessimists, or proponents of \"degrowth\" to proponents of \"green growth\") is not constructive Lastly, given the well-known limitations of GDP as a measure of well-being, it is also important to bear in mind that the definition of growth itself is bound to evolve in the future.", "For instance, as recently stressed by Professor Nicholas Stern and co-authors in an IMF working paper,17 we should move from a \"flow- centred focus on GDP\" to a \"stock-centred focus on a broad definition of capital\"; \"the conceptual framework used by policymakers must treat planetary boundaries - notably climate overshoot - as a hard constraint\".", "They also propose to establish an annual carbon budget at the national level which would be binding.", "In short, if we are to hold a serious discussion about what an ecological transition means for central banks, including the impact it will have on output and other key macroeconomic variables, we need to be able to engage in a responsible and scientific manner on these difficult questions, rather than sweeping them under the rug.", "Finally, I would like to state that living and thriving within ecological limits is also about coming to terms with our own limits as human beings, and acknowledging our own mistakes.", "In an age of rampant ecological destruction and rising socioeconomic inequalities, we (policymakers, central bankers, economists, and so on) should also acknowledge the limits of the analytical frameworks and policy proposals that we have been using.", "In this context, The Green Swan reminds us that ecological risks (including but not limited to climate change) are so complex that we will never be able to accurately measure them, meaning that we should learn by doing.", "After centuries of economic development during which we did not care so much about the limits of the Earth (its resources and its ability to absorb pollutions such as carbon emissions), it is time to pause and think about what we have done.", "In ancient mythology Prometheus, who stole fire from the Gods -
