the rate of unemployment consistent with stable wage growth and domestic inflation - then changes in unemployment can give you a cleaner (if later) read than GDP growth alone on how spare capacity is developing.", "This, at least, is how I understood the MPC's conditional guidance back in 2013 (which singled out the rate of unemployment) and, more generally, the weight the Committee began to put on the labour market following the financial crisis (Broadbent, 2014).", "However, if even the NAIRU can shift around - or, more generally, wages and domestic inflation are subject to important influences other than spare capacity - then GDP and unemployment may still be insufficient.", "You also need to consider the behaviour of these nominal variables more directly.", "As I sought to explain in a talk this past summer, this is one way to understand why the MPC has had to pay more attention to wage growth and services inflation than in the past - more, in fact, than to economic growth.", "Judging by the huge expansion in the number of vacancies in 2022, and steep declines too in surveys of labour availability, the labour market seemed to be significantly tighter than the rate of unemployment alone would have suggested (Chart 7).", "Chart 7: The labour market was exceptionally tight in 2022 Sources: Bank of England, ONS and Bank calculations.", "Average of Agents' individual company visit scores.", "This indicated that that the NAIRU had risen, perhaps because, amidst all the shifts created by the pandemic, the labour market was having a hard time reabsorbing the significant numbers coming back to work and reallocating them in line with demand[6].", "The very pronounced second-round effects of higher import prices on domestic prices and wages can be thought of in a similar way - they too can boost inflation even for a given rate of unemployment.", "Taken together these developments suggest that, on top of output growth and unemployment, policy should put some weight on these nominal variables, even if that means waiting that much longer to respond to (what subsequently turns out to have been) true shocks to demand.", "Trading off timeliness for a better understanding of what's going on in the economy, uncertainty about the supply side pushes one further to the right of the schematic picture in Chart 8.", "Chart 8: Lags in the inflation process mean that, when the policymaker is uncertain about supply, there's a trade-off between a better understanding of the economy and the timeliness of the policy response The lag between movements in spare capacity and inflation is longer and the price one pays for this extra information, in time, is therefore higher.", "There are clearly risks in moving only when you see \"the whites of inflation's eyes\".", "But it may still be a price worth paying.", "The two graphs below (Chart 9), derived from a simple model of inflation in which there's incomplete information about the shocks hitting the economy[7], help to cement the point.", "In this representation inflation can be moved around by four underlying drivers -

it actually grew reasonably strongly - but because of a recovery in participation.", "According to the LFS, significant numbers of people decided to return to work and not all of them were able to find jobs straightaway.", "The more general point is this: we care more about unemployment than employment and movements in the second aren't necessarily enough to tell us about the first.", "Chart 10: Change in unemployment depends on the difference between the growth rates in the active workforce and employment; both can vary Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.", "So, during this temporary suspension of the LFS, the ONS is instead basing its estimates of unemployment on developments in the claimant count -

maybe the benefit numbers are telling us that the rise in LFS unemployment, even as moderate as it's been, has been overstated.", "But for several reasons I suspect it's the other way around - that the claimant count understates the rise in unemployment over that period.", "First, for what it's worth, LFS unemployment is considerably less variable over short periods of time than employment

work are much more likely to claim benefit if they'd had a job immediately beforehand.", "Those moving from inactivity - people coming back into the labour market after taking time off, for example, or students leaving full-time education - are much less likely to do so (Chart 14), even if they're unable immediately to find work and therefore count as unemployed.", "And it means that one wouldn't

definitely still rising.", "Our indicator model suggests employment is broadly flat so, at least in the near term, any rise in unemployment would arise only because of continuing growth in the active workforce - and the participation rate is simply too volatile to count on that in the near term.", "The point I want to make is more that, during the temporary suspension of the LFS, the loss of the unemployment series matters a little more than that for employment.", "It matters more in basic models of wage growth (which is why it's one of the variables stressed by the MPC).", "And proxies for the change in unemployment - whether just flipping round the figure for employment growth or seeing what's happened to the claimant count - do not, over short periods of time, perform that well.",

14 million employees, almost half of their total number.", "All that said, the official wage data are nonetheless subject to revision, thanks to late returns; even though it's adjusted for outliers (the ONS tops and tails the raw numbers from the MWSS) AWE growth can be pretty volatile, particularly over short periods of time; and, for much of this year, the headline figure has been higher than

seeing a degree of re-convergence - the official data have softened a bit in the last couple of months.", "But the slightly muddy picture of the recent past, coupled with the general volatility of the data, means the MPC would probably want to see more evidence, across several indicators, before concluding things are on a clear downward trend.", "The recent volatility of the AWE is apparent enough in Chart 15.", "It can be seen more directly in Chart 17, which plots the standard deviations of quarterly private-sector AWE growth over rolling four-year periods (so that the very last data point covers the period since the onset of the pandemic).", "The sharp pick-up in wage growth has been accompanied by a similar rise in its volatility.", "It's also clear in Chart 18.", "This plots the output of what's called a \"dynamic factor model\", a statistical filter that uses the sectoral information within the AWE to decompose headline wage growth into \"trend\" and \"transitory\" components[10].", "Quite a bit of the marked acceleration in AWE growth over the spring and summer is interpreted, at least by this model, to have been transitory.", "Chart 17: Short-term AWE growth

indicators of wage growth.", "None of the three in Chart 15 has a long history[11]; the DMP and the two surveys of recruitment agents (the Indeed wage tracker and the REC index in Chart 16) all have much smaller coverage than the official MWSS.", "So they should certainly be treated with a degree of caution.", "Taken together, however, it's noticeable that, like the \"trend\" estimate in Chart 18, none exhibited quite the same strength as (or pick-up in) AWE growth in mid-2023.", "And I do think it's worth paying attention to two in particular, the REC index and the tax-derived \"Real Time Information\" (RTI) pay series.", "As I said, the coverage of the REC survey must be significantly smaller than that of the AWE (most people don't find jobs via recruitment agents).", "But it's also much longer-lived than the other indicators (it started in 1997).", "And for nearly all that period it has had a pretty good - and, indeed, a leading - statistical relationship with short-term changes in the official wage index.", "Movements in the REC have tended to foreshadow those in quarterly AWE growth around four months later, with a reasonable degree of reliability.", "This was clearly not the case earlier this year: the REC index peaked over a year ago and then fell back steeply over the following six months.", "On past form one might then have expected a decline in private-sector AWE growth starting early in the New Year.", "In fact, between January and July, the index accelerated significantly, rising at an annualised rate of over 9% over that six-month period.", "It's not clear why the REC proved so misleading.", "One possibility is that the \"second-round\" effects of high inflation were skewed towards existing rather than new employees (coming from a survey of recruitment agents the REC picks up only the latter).", "We know that firms were accepting significant increases in wages early this year in order to help compensate employees for the steep rises in the cost of living.", "If these were aimed more at retaining than attracting people, and therefore paid disproportionately to people already at the firm, this would help to explain the divergence in Chart 16.", "It would also suggest that, as these effects fade, the relationship between the two should re-establish itself (certainly it's hard to think of something that would permanently have ruptured the link).", "The second is the RTI series derived from tax data.", "This is much younger than the REC survey (it started in 2014).", "On the other hand, its sample size is even bigger than the MWSS - more than twice as big, in fact.", "It covers everybody subject to PAYE income tax (around 30 million people[12]).", "Helpfully, it also has a wealth of detail.", "One can distinguish between changes in the median and the mean (for various reasons economists at the Bank tend to favour the former[13]).", "It also offers a sectoral breakdown, allowing us to construct a reasonably good proxy for private- sector pay alone[14].", "One drawback is that, unlike the AWE, it's not possible to strip out bonus payments (the MPC generally cares more about regular, non-bonus pay growth[15]).", "Given these huge samples, for both series, and what must therefore be a big overlap between the two populations, it's perhaps surprising that the AWE and RTI series aren't routinely closer to each other.", "At least in 2023, some of the gap in Chart 15 may relate to this question of bonuses.", "According to the AWE, bonus growth was relatively subdued this year.", "So growth of the aggregate - with which the RTI series is probably more fairly compared - was slightly weaker than that of regular pay, and therefore closer to the RTI figure (Chart 19).", "But there's still a gap, although that too has narrowed a bit in the past couple of releases.", "In the three months to October, privatesector pay including bonuses was 7.2% higher than in the same period of 2022.", "This compares with 6.8% for the median of the RTI series, a figure that in the three months to November fell to 6.2%.", "Chart 19: For much of this year tax-based estimates of private-sector wage growth have been lower than that in the AWE Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.", "RTI 'private sector' measures are Bank staff estimates - see footnote to Chart 15.", "I should be clear that the MPC still puts most weight on the AWE series.", "And it's evident from all of them that pay growth - and with it other indicators of domestic inflation like the services component of the CPI - has been significantly faster than the sorts of rates that, over time, one might think of as consistent with the 2% inflation target.", "But, taking all this together, there is a question about whether rapid pick-up in wage growth in the spring and summer was quite as marked as in the official data.", "AWE growth has been particularly volatile in the past year or so and other indicators of wage growth haven't been quite as strong.", "By the same token, of course, the noisiness of these measures, and the discrepancies between them must also inject a degree of caution about the more recent decline.", "One would want to see further evidence, across several indicators, before concluding things are on a clear downward trend.", "In a speech in the autumn of 2007 my predecessor Charlie Bean said policymaking had sometimes been likened to \"driving along a winding road looking only in the rear-view mirror\" (Bean, 2007).", "If this was a warning about the unpredictability of the future then the events of the following year certainly justified it.", "But it's not just the future that's uncertain - so is our assessment of the present and recent past.", "Charlie went on: \"I wish it were that easy.", "In practice, the rear window is also a little misted up.", "Not only do we not know where we are going, but we have only an imperfect idea of where we have been.\"", "At times this uncertainty can be very costly.", "Early estimates of GDP growth during the late-80s boom significantly under-estimated the strength of the economy (Chart 20).", "This may have affected the setting of monetary policy and contributed to the scale of the subsequent inflation.", "Chart 20: GDP growth was under-measured during the boom of the late 1980s Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.Mature estimate is three years after the first estimate.", "Early GDP estimates have improved considerably since then.", "Because we also have more sources of information about economic activity, and better statistical methods for using them, inaccuracy in the measurement of current output growth is much less of a problem than it once was.", "At the same time, uncertainty about the behaviour of the supply side of the economy has probably reduced the relative importance of these output data anyway.", "Instead (or at least in addition) monetary policy has had to put more weight on a range of other indicators - unemployment and other measures of slack in the labour market, latterly wage and domestic price inflation as well - that tell us something about how the supply side is behaving and can therefore make policy more robust to uncertainty about it.", "But it's not possible to offset that uncertainty entirely.", "When the economy is subjected to a greater range of shocks it can be harder to identify their individual contributions.", "Even if the observed economy were measured with perfect accuracy our understanding of what's caused it - the precise behaviour of these underlying economic forces - would still be imperfect.", "And in the real world there's inevitably a degree of inaccuracy in economic measurement.", "Currently, if only for a short period of time, there's a little more uncertainty than usual about the behaviour of unemployment.", "Official estimates of wage growth have been volatile and other indicators have exhibited slightly lower (if still very elevated) rates of growth through much of this year.", "As a general matter, one implication of this additional uncertainty is that, in response to any given shock, the reaction of policy is likely to be somewhat more delayed than in a world of perfect and complete information.", "It takes time to understand the forces driving the economy, particularly if one's having to rely on nominal variables like services inflation and wage growth, things that would normally be seen as late-cycle indicators.", "The same goes for uncertainty relating to the accuracy of the observable variables themselves.", "One current example is wage growth.", "Given the volatility in the official estimates, and the disparity (such as it is) among the various indicators we have, it will probably require a more protracted and clearer decline in these series before the MPC can safely conclude that things are on a firmly downward trend.", "I've received helpful comments from colleagues at the Bank of England.", "I'd like to thank Rich Harrison, Tom Key, Jack Page, Kate Reinold, and especially Fabrizio Cadamagnani and Lindsey Rice-Jones for their help in preparing the speech.", "The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England.", "Technically - and perfectly intuitively - a necessary condition for being able to infer (\"identify\") these deeper causes is that we have at least as many observable variables.", "If (for example) you see only the quantity of output of some good but you know it can in principle be affected by two unobservable drivers (demand or supply shocks, say) then, in the absence of any other information, it obviously won't be possible to say which of them is behind any particular move in output.", "All you can do is to guess, based on their relative importance over the past, which is likely to have been the more significant (there's an example of this kind of \"signal extraction\" problem in a simple model below.)", "And even when that numerical condition is satisfied, and a more complete allocation of effect to cause is possible, estimation error in our models means we can't do that with complete precision.", "In the case of demand and supply shocks, for example, you can in principle work out which is behind any particular movement in quantities if you also get to observe what's happening with prices: increases in demand and supply both raise output but they have opposite effects (up and down respectively) on prices.", "However, to determine their respective contributions you still need to know the slopes of the supply and demand curves and, unavoidably, there is a degree of uncertainty about exactly what those are.", "Response rates had been declining before 2020 but, perhaps as a lasting effect of the pandemic, have done so faster since.", "Similar downward trends have been seen in many other countries (see, for example, de Leeuw et al, 2018 ).", "The ONS plans to re-start publication of the LFS in the New Year.", "For some time it has also been developing an improved, \"Transformed Labour Force Survey\" (TLFS).", "This should be ready for publication in the spring of next year.", "Details of the TLFS, and the ONS's methods for constructing estimates of labour market quantities in the meantime, can be found here and here .", "If employment is over-measured one quarter then, on the reasonable assumption that the measurement error is uncorrelated from one period to the next, you'd expect on average to see weaker growth the following quarter.", "In symbols, if (the log of) employment is measured with some serially uncorrelated error error \u03b5, such that = + , where l is the true number, then its growth rate will a moving-average error term: \u2206 = \u2206 + \u2206 .", "In simple tests on the UK time series the presence of this term shows up with a high degree of statistical significance.", "Independently, and alongside the main LFS release, the ONS has always published estimates of sampling error for various series.", "The latest release, in September this year, had a figure of \u00b10.5 percentage points for quarterly employment growth.", "See, for example, Giannone, Reichlin and Small (2008) .", "The particular models used by the Bank are described in Anesti et al (2017) and Daniell and Moreira (2023) .", "Using a crude multiplier to turn one into the other, the red line includes the Bank-Rate equivalent of votes for QE.", "It was also the case in many countries, including the UK, that the pandemic resulted in a significant decline in labour market participation, persuading some people to retire earlier than they might have done.", "It's not obvious this matters directly for inflationary pressure, at least once you've taken into account any impact it might have had on the rate of unemployment: in most simple empirical models of wage growth, it's unemployment (relative to the NAIRU) that is the relevant measure of slack in the labour market.", "However, it's possible the early retirers were more concentrated in some parts of the economy than others, in which case the drop in participation might have added to mismatch in the labour market, contributing to the rise in the NAIRU.", "The model is set out in more detail in a short Annex to this speech.", "In a speech she's due to give tomorrow, my colleague Sarah Breeden presents some simulations along these lines, exploring what happens when the policymaker is uncertain about the degree of persistence in inflationary disturbances.", "If policy is therefore set assuming some sort of average across the various possibilities, and the degree of persistence turns out to be towards the upper end of that prior distribution, inflation will obviously end up overshooting the target.", "Similarly, if the shock turns out to be more transient, inflation will end up being too low.", "If u is the rate of unemployment, gA the growth in the active workforce and gE that of employment, then the change in unemployment is This differs from the difference between the two growth rates only by a factor 1-u, which is in general is pretty close to one.", "This model was estimated by economists at the Bank and is based on the approach of Stock and Watson (2016) .", "Stock and Watson designed it originally as a measure of trend price inflation, using 17 sectors of the US PCE inflation index.", "The tax-based RTI measure exists since 2014.", "This is greater than the number of employees (28.5 million).", "The reason is that the RTI statistics have slightly larger coverage (they include Northern Ireland, HM Armed Forces and government-supported trainees paid via PAYE, pay- rolled redundancy payments and signing-on fees, all of which are excluded from AWE).", "In addition, some people running their own businesses, and therefore classified as self-employed in the LFS, will still pay themselves salaries and therefore PAYE income tax as well.", "The AWE measures mean pay.", "But, to construct it, the ONS lops off the outliers in the responses, pushing the measure closer to a median.", "The RTI statistics are experimental and may not be similarly adjusted.", "The series for \"private-sector\" RTI pay growth in these graphs simply strips out industrial sectors with a wholly or near- wholly public-sector presence: public administration and defence, social security, education, health and social work.", "On the whole the MPC is more interested in the regular (non-bonus) component of wages.", "This is partly because bonuses are more volatile.", "More importantly, it's not clear they really count as a marginal cost for the firm.", "Bonuses get paid out of profits already earned and, unlike regular pay, do not need to be pledged in advance as a condition of
