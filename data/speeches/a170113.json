of drawing the right lessons in this regard to avoid pitfalls.", "The RBI has been working closely with all IFSC stakeholders on diverse subjects in recent years to help GIFT develop.", "Today we see intense competition among the major IFCSs trying to position themselves for various business lines, and increase their business potential, which is the theme of this seminar.", "In addition to the usual attributes there are two other dimensions, viz., the broader economic environment in tandem with associated policies, and the micro ecosystem specific to the IFSC sector.", "As we celebrate GIFT
