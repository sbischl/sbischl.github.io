broadly defined as farm production and output from related industries - accounts for almost one-sixth of U.S. jobs and economic activity.", "While the farm share of economic output has declined as other parts of our economy have grown, increased activity in broader agricultural industries - manufacturing, transportation, distribution and food retailing - has opened new job opportunities in both rural and metro communities.", "A robust agricultural sector cushioned the rural economy in our and other regions across the nation during the recent recession, and the industry's strength is supporting further improvement in the rural economy today.", "In 2010, strong demand and tight supplies for most farm commodities contributed to a sharp rebound in farm profits, which then supported sales in farm equipment and other farm-based industries.", "Strong profits from agriculture also girded important elements of our rural financial system.", "Commercial banks with large agricultural loan portfolios posted stronger returns than their peers over the past three years.", "While more than 300 commercial banks failed during this time, only 22 were agricultural banks.", "Agriculture is also benefitting directly from the rebounding economic strength of China and other emerging market economies, where rapid income growth is driving up food demand.", "The United States remains a net exporter of agricultural products, shipping more than 40 percent of its wheat, cotton, soybeans and rice crops to foreign countries in 2010.", "United States crop and meat exports are expected to rise to record highs in 2011.", "Looking out a little further, economists expect global growth to exceed 4 percent well into 2012, with the developing and emerging market economies remaining in the lead.", "Rapid income gains in the developing world promise further increases in demand for higher-protein diets.", "Developing risks in agriculture Despite prospects of sustained farm income growth, U.S. producers must remain alert as they face challenges related to their very success and tied to recent developments in financial markets.", "Surging commodity prices and low interest rates have translated into increasing farmland values, which have eclipsed their 1980s peaks.", "In our Bank's fourth quarter 2010 Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions, for example, cropland values in Nebraska and Kansas were nearly 20 percent above year-ago levels and more than 75 percent higher than five years ago.", "This run-up in farmland values has occurred, however, amid financial markets characterized by high levels of liquidity and unusually low interest rates.", "History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to determine how much of the farmland boom may be an unsustainable bubble driven by financial markets and how much results from fundamental changes in demand and supply conditions.", "Therefore, it will surprise no one when I say we are watching the market closely, just as we are watching for imbalances emerging elsewhere in the economy.", "Of particular interest to me is how agriculture might adjust when financial markets return to more-normal interest rate conditions.", "Rising interest rates often coincide with falling farm revenues and higher capitalization rates, a depressing combination for farmland values.", "Moreover, even if crop prices remain high but capitalization rates return to their historic average, farmland values could fall by as much as a third, which most certainly would erode the financial health of the farm sector.", "Fortunately, the industry entered this period with a relatively strong balance sheet.", "Farm leverage ratios are at historic lows, and agricultural banks are well capitalized.", "In addition, farm operators and banks have strengthened their risk-management practices, using basic hedging strategies and derivative markets to manage price and balance sheet risk, which contributed to smaller increases in problem assets at agricultural banks than at their peers.", "Nevertheless, I follow the basic lesson that bad loans are made in good times, and I remain watchful.", "In closing, I'll briefly highlight a symposium the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted last summer to consider agriculture's response to the extraordinary shifts occurring in market conditions.", "There was a marked and, in my view, a very healthy consensus that the industry's success will lie not in its ability to follow a single path, but in its ability to adapt quickly to shifting economic landscapes and conditions.", "Still, my nagging concern remains that current distortions in financial markets are increasing the risk that imbalances in asset markets will catch agriculture -
