companies has deteriorated by 10 per cent since 1996.", "This is due entirely to pay increases awarded by manufacturing industry's organisations and companies.", "Underlying this cost inflation is a

per cent the last couple of years.", "The krone exchange rate has appreciated since the summer of 2000 as a result of a wider interest rate differential between Norway and other countries.", "Combined with low growth abroad and increased trade with low-cost countries such as China, this has led to a slower rise in import prices.", "A higher rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services reflects an increase in labour costs in Norway.", "As the world economy recovers, import price inflation will probably edge up.", "A rise in labour costs of more than 5 per cent will only be consistent with the inflation target if the krone continues to appreciate.", "In our projections for the Norwegian economy in the next two years, we expect 5 per cent wage growth.", "As long as wages increase this much, the business sector's competitiveness will decline, thus contributing to a reduction in employment in goods-producing industries.", "When manufacturing and other industries exposed to competition are scaled back to the extent that there is room for a larger service sector, competitiveness will once again stabilise.", "In the long run, wages must be compatible with the value added that is generated by workers, i.e.", "Over time, the increase in real wages is therefore determined by developments in labour productivity.", "In mainland Norway, annual productivity growth has averaged 11\u20442 - 2 per cent over the last 20 years.", "If this continues to be the case, an average increase in labour costs of around 4 - 41\u20442 per cent in the long term will be consistent with the inflation target.", "The guidelines for economic policy may affect the krone exchange rate in two ways.", "On the one hand, increased use of petroleum revenues may lead to a deterioration of the business sector's competitiveness.", "With low and stable inflation, this may at times be reflected in a strong krone.", "On the other hand, our inflation target is slightly higher than our trading partners' inflation targets.", "In the long run, this will be offset by a corresponding depreciation of the krone.", "The international rise in prices for manufactured goods is lower than for services - around 1 per cent.", "The inflation target of 21\u20442 per cent implies a depreciation of the Norwegian krone of around 1\u20442 per cent in the long term, because the target has been set somewhat higher than our trading partners' inflation target.", "This means that goods prices measured in Norwegian krone must be expected to rise by about 11\u20442 per cent in the long term.", "With wage growth of 4 - 41\u20442 per cent, productivity growth in manufacturing must be about 21\u20442 - 3 per cent to maintain profitability.", "For services, price inflation can be somewhat higher, about 3 - 31\u20442 per cent, and productivity gains correspondingly lower.", "The size of the exposed sector will be affected by the portion of petroleum revenues that is absorbed into the Norwegian economy.", "In the long run, monetary policy cannot influence overall employment or its distribution across industries.", "Historically, employment in the internationally exposed sector has declined in waves.", "The sharpest declines in manufacturing employment were observed in the years between 1977 and 1984 and from 1987 to 1992.", "Both periods were preceded by a considerable deterioration in cost competitiveness in manufacturing.", "There is a risk of a new period of decline in manufacturing.", "The restructuring in manufacturing may take place rapidly.", "Competitiveness has deteriorated by about 10 per cent since 1996.", "We do not know how long this development will continue.", "The long-term requirements for improving the balance between wage growth and productivity growth may become apparent at an early stage.", "Developments for Norwegian enterprises do not, however, have to be negative.", "Some enterprises could be at the forefront of technological developments and increase efficiency more rapidly than the relatively high rate of growth in real wages in Norway.", "Many enterprises move large portions of their production abroad.", "Norwegian manufacturing companies could still be profitable even if the significance of the manufacturing sector in the Norwegian economy is reduced.", "However, scaling back manufacturing involves a risk.", "It makes the economy more vulnerable.", "The growth potential of the economy - the basis for learning, innovation and development - may be impaired when less of the business sector is exposed to intense foreign
