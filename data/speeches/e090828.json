when and how to remove stimulus, how to secure the stability of the global financial system, and, importantly, and over the long term, how to set the stage for a return to rising living standards.", "It is this last challenge that I'd like to focus on later in my remarks.", "I will start with a few comments on how the recovery is likely to unfold and the forces that will be driving it, and what this outlook means in terms of the output gap.", "Then I'd like to look at Canada's growth trajectory beyond the recovery by focusing on two key variables that affect both potential and actual output - labour input and productivity.", "Given the significant changes foreseen in the labour market and their implications for output, it's clear that Canada, like many other nations, needs to improve its productivity if we are to reap the benefits of sustained growth.", "I'll also touch on the important role of monetary policy and financial system policy in setting the stage for sustainable growth.", "After I conclude, I'd be happy to respond to comments and questions.", "The outlook for the economy The Canadian economy is expected to start growing again this quarter.", "Our July Monetary Policy Report discusses the factors underpinning this earlier-than-expected resumption of growth.", "Globally, there are signs of a nascent recovery.", "More specifically, the U.S. economy is likely to start recovering this quarter, and growth is also picking up again in China, a major source of demand for raw materials.", "In Canada, domestic demand is strengthening, supported by improved financial conditions, a rebound in consumer and business confidence, and firmer commodity prices.", "Canada's economic recovery will be supported by a combination of factors, which is likely to make it somewhat more robust than elsewhere.", "First, the composition of economic activity in the United States as it recovers will prove favourable to Canadian exporters - as the sectors hit hardest by the recession, such as housing and automobiles, rebound.", "Second, Canada's relatively well-functioning financial system will enable credit to meet the needs of an expanding economy.", "A third supportive factor is the underlying strength of household, business, and government balance sheets.", "These favourable circumstances are expected to support the return to economic growth, with the output gap closing by mid-2011.", "Of course, many uncertainties remain - and economic forecasters are notoriously more prone to error around turning points in the cycle.", "The July MPR identifies the upside risk of economic momentum in Canada being stronger and more sustained than expected.", "On the downside, the risks relate mainly to the external sector.", "There is a possibility that financial conditions may normalize more slowly than expected, and further setbacks cannot be precluded.", "Two downside risks require elaboration.", "First, it's important to bear in mind that a good deal of the impetus for the recovery, in Canada and worldwide, is coming from the public sector - from policy actions by governments and central banks.", "The scale of fiscal expansion has been quite substantial.", "Monetary policy has also been eased aggressively, bringing policy interest rates close to their effective lower bound in most advanced economies.", "In Canada, the target overnight rate of 1/4 per cent is reinforced by our conditional commitment to keep the rate at its current level until the middle of next year.", "This monetary easing counters other factors - such as tighter lending conditions and wider-than-usual yield spreads on corporate bonds - that would otherwise have resulted in tighter overall financial conditions.", "Other central banks, given the situations they have been facing, have gone even further by providing additional stimulus through quantitative and/or credit easing.", "In many countries, the authorities have also had to provide substantial direct support to financial institutions facing difficulties.", "Although we have been spared that in Canada, this support has been an important bolster for the global recovery.", "While these policy actions have been timely and effective, they imply that the incipient recovery depends to a considerable degree on official action.", "At what stage will private demand be robust enough to make the recovery self-sustaining?", "Clearly, we haven't reached that point yet.", "A second important risk is the possibility of persistent strength in the Canadian dollar, which would work against the positive factors that I mentioned earlier.", "The recent rise in the dollar is, in part, a reflection of the same factors that are leading to a recovery in Canada, notably the rebound in commodity prices.", "It is also a result of a more generalized weakening of the U.S. dollar, as global financial conditions normalize.", "Other things being equal, a persistently strong Canadian dollar would reduce real growth and delay the return of inflation to target.", "If a stronger dollar were to alter the path of projected inflation relative to that presented in our July Monetary Policy Report, we would need to take that into account.", "As we have said before, even though we are at the effective lower bound for our policy rate, we retain considerable flexibility through the use of unconventional monetary policy instruments, including quantitative easing.", "The output gap and the evolution of potential output I'll now turn to the output gap and potential output.", "The output gap is the difference between actual and potential output - with the latter defined as the level of output that can be achieved with existing labour, capital, and technology without putting sustained upward pressure on inflation.", "The concept has been much maligned, partly because it is not an observed variable, and it is subject to considerable measurement problems.", "However, it remains a convenient \"shorthand\" for characterizing underlying inflation pressures, and for bridging between the current conjuncture and the factors that will condition economic growth over the medium term, as the output gap is closed.", "Our current situation of excess supply (a negative output gap) implies, all else being equal, that core CPI inflation can be expected to decline and then recover as actual output growth exceeds potential, while the level of output returns to potential.", "The output gap is best used to complement more detailed and micro-founded analysis, particularly that captured in more formal models.", "For example, our main projection model for the Canadian economy, ToTEM, has a structure that is based on explicit assumptions about firms' profit objectives and the constraints that they face when setting prices.", "As a result, the output gap is not a direct determinant of inflation in ToTEM, in the sense that when firms set prices, they do not explicitly take account of the aggregate output gap.", "More generally, we pay attention to a variety of indicators of inflationary pressures, such as core inflation, yield curves, and credit indicators.", "I should emphasize that we don't use any of these indicators in isolation nor in a mechanical fashion.", "We use a good deal of judgment in interpreting changes in the economy, as well as in making monetary policy decisions.", "Now, three quarters after the onset of a severe recession, the output gap has widened substantially.", "This is indicated by the fact that output is now below its trend level, as represented by the Bank of Canada's conventional measure of the output gap, and corroborated by other indicators of excess supply.", "For example, the Bank's summer Business Outlook Survey showed that the percentage of firms that would have difficulty meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained at an exceptionally low level.", "Most labour market indicators also mirror the weakness in product markets, and jobs continue to be lost.", "After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures and the ongoing restructuring in the Canadian economy, the Bank judged that the economy was recently operating about 3.5 per cent below its production capacity.", "While the usual premise is that the output gap will close over time, the interesting question is how this will occur.", "In the current circumstances, we believe that it will come about both through lower potential and increased output.", "There are several reasons to expect potential output to be altered by a major recession.", "In Some of the decline in employment may turn out to be persistent - for instance, because high unemployment may discourage workers from seeking employment or because workers' job skills may deteriorate during long spells of unemployment.", "Labour displacement associated with firm closures and mass layoffs tends to increase during recessions, adding to structural unemployment, particularly for older displaced workers.", "The lower level of investment during the recession translates into lower productive capacity.", "In addition, plant closures mean that some capital is effectively scrapped (although this is not fully reflected in the measured capital stock).", "\u2022 Total factor productivity may either increase or decrease, at least temporarily.", "It could decrease as spending on research and development declines, and as workers' jobspecific human capital is lost as they find employment in different sectors.", "It could also increase if, for example, the recession weeds out the less-productive activities associated with a pre-crisis \"bubble economy,\" or stimulates efficiency gains through changes in work practices.", "There is also evidence that recessions associated with financial crises are more severe and more protracted than other recessions, and that a financial crisis negatively and permanently affects potential output - as highlighted in a recent paper by Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff.", "These forces are at work worldwide, as economies absorb the impact of the global recession.", "A recent OECD study analyzed the factors influencing potential output across the advanced economies, and traced the implications for growth through 2017.4 This study concluded that growth will be slower, to varying degrees, in most countries.", "Similar forces are at work in Canada.", "In our April Monetary Policy Report, we lowered our estimate of potential output for the 2009-2011 period.", "Here, one key consideration is the structural changes under way in key sectors of the Canadian economy - notably, automobiles, energy, and forest products.", "We were also taking account of the sharp drop in investment that has taken place, particularly for machinery and equipment.", "As a result, we expected potential output growth to slow to 1.1 per cent in 2009, and then pick up gradually to 1.5 per cent in 2010 and to 1.9 per cent in 2011.5 We will be reviewing this estimate in the October Report.", "So, that's the outlook for the medium term.", "Let me turn now to examine the evolution of potential growth over the long term.", "I'll discuss each of the two components, trend labour input and trend labour productivity, emphasizing longer-term trends and reflecting on how these trends may have been affected by the current recession.", "Labour input: A drag on potential output growth For the past 30 years, Canada, like some other nations, has been sailing with a favourable wind at its back.", "Potential output has increased fairly steadily at about 2.7 per cent per annum, largely because of long-term increases in labour input - that is, the total hours supplied by the labour force.", "Since 1977, trend labour input - a function of population, the labour force employment rate, and the change in average weekly hours worked - has grown about 1.6 per cent annually.", "Some key factors here have been the growth of the working-age population as baby boomers reached working age and, to a lesser extent, the increased participation of women in the labour force.", "Over the next few years, these trends will begin to lose steam.", "Those on the leading edge of the baby boom are now in their 60s.", "Growth in the working-age population is slowing, and participation rates are declining.", "As these changes work their way through the population, they will have a dampening effect on trend labour input.", "As well, the dependency ratio is likely to double over the next 20 years.", "The demographic challenges that we have been worrying about for years have started to arrive.", "D.

in fact, the gap exists in most industries.", "This is important because ICT capital investment has been linked to stronger multifactor productivity growth in many countries, as firms reorganize their workplaces to take advantage of new technology.", "Bank of Canada research suggests that the contribution of ICT capital to productivity growth over the first half of this decade has been considerable.", "A second, and related, factor is Canada's poor record on innovation.", "In a recent report, Peter Nicholson concluded that \"too many businesses in Canada are technology followers, not leaders\" and stressed the need for \"innovation-based business strategies.", "\"11 Canada stands only 16th within the OECD in the intensity of business research and development.", "Moreover, this situation exists despite the fact that Canada would appear to have all the ingredients needed for innovation: a highly educated work force, flexible labour markets, and high rates of firm entry and exit.", "A third influence on aggregate productivity growth is the reallocation of capital and labour across firms.", "Recent Bank of Canada research suggests that job reallocation across firms is a significant positive factor explaining Canadian labour productivity growth over the 19922006 period.", "This in turn suggests that such reallocation may be associated with more efficient economic specialization and the adoption of new work practices.", "Of course, the short-run effects are likely to be negative, since it takes time and training for workers who have been reallocated to become fully productive.", "Thus, when the economy undergoes major structural changes - such as at the present time - productivity growth may suffer in the short term and then recover - perhaps even to a higher rate - but only with a lag.", "Interestingly, a recent study by John Baldwin and Wulong Gu, using a growth-accounting framework, shows results consistent with the three influences just discussed - that is, multifactor productivity (MFP), rather than capital intensity, is the main culprit in Canada's lagging productivity performance.", "They note that two industries in particular - mining and oil and gas extraction and manufacturing - account for much of the slowdown in MFP growth in this decade.", "Against this background, we can consider the implications of the global financial crisis and recession for Canada's future productivity growth.", "Productivity growth tends to vary over the cycle, declining in the downturn and then rising during the recovery as labour is more fully utilized.", "But the recession may also have more persistent implications for productivity growth.", "First, investment has fallen off sharply, which in turn reduces the growth of capital per worker - even as labour is shed.", "And, because capital investment often embodies new technology, reduced investment will dampen MFP growth.", "Second, investment in research and development is likely to suffer even more in the downturn.", "Third, as I noted earlier, the ongoing process of sectoral adjustment and reallocation of resources dampens productivity growth during the adjustment process.", "The adjustments now occurring in several sectors of the Canadian economy, including automobiles and forest products, are a particularly important example.", "Both physical capital and human capital - in the form of industry-specific and firm-specific skills - are also inevitably lost in such an adjustment.", "P.
