of our monetary policy - from risk-free rates to government borrowing costs to capital markets to bank lending for firms and households.", "Within the broad-based set of indicators that we monitor to assess whether financing conditions are still favourable, risk-free overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates and sovereign yields are particularly important, because they are good early indicators of what

continue - firms and households will only be able to take full advantage of favourable financing conditions if national policy measures are deployed to help monetary policy unfold its full

and promoting change.", "First, by ensuring that NGEU funds can be fully operational when the decisions on own resources are ratified in all Member States, which in many cases involves national parliaments.", "And second, by creating the right economic environment to boost the impact of NGEU.", "This means improving the quality of government spending and ensuring that NGEU is firmly rooted
