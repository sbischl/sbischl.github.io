{"sentences": ["In the spirit of this conference, I asked myself what developments in the past eighteen years - both in the economy and in the economics profession - were most important in changing the way we at the Federal Reserve have approached and implemented monetary policy.", "The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 to counter the recurrent credit stringencies that had so frequently been experienced in earlier decades.", "As lender of last resort, we had a mandate that, at least viewed from today's perspective, was limited.", "We did not engage in Systemwide open market operations until the 1920s.", "And as recently as the 1950s, the framework within which those open market operations were formulated was still being developed.", "Credit was eased when the economy weakened and tightened when inflation threatened, but largely in an ad hoc manner.", "As a consequence, the Federal Reserve was perceived by some as often accentuating, rather than damping, cycles in prices and activity.", "Importantly, however, the surge in prices that followed the removal of wage and price controls after World War II and again after the Korean War kept monetary policymakers wary of the threat of inflation.", "But concern that the monetary restraint of the 1950s had led to unnecessarily high unemployment persuaded the Federal Open Market Committee to adopt a more stimulative policy stance in the mid1960s.", "Those actions appear to have been predicated, in part, on an acceptance of the then-prevalent view that a long-term tradeoff existed between inflation and unemployment.", "Subsequently, however, the experience of stagflation in the 1970s and intellectual advances in understanding the importance of expectations - which built on the earlier work of Friedman and Phelps - undermined the notion of a long-run tradeoff.", "Inflation again became widely viewed as being detrimental to financial stability and macroeconomic performance.", "And as the decade progressed, a keener appreciation for the monetary roots of inflation emerged both in the profession at large and at central banks.", "Indeed, the insights from the work of Friedman and Schwartz a decade earlier gained greater prominence in the realm of practical policy.", "These events, both economic and intellectual, significantly influenced the tool kits employed by macroeconomists inside and outside policymaking institutions.", "The large-scale macromodels that had been the focus of so much work in the 1960s came under attack on two fronts.", "Most prominently, greater recognition of the importance of expectations suggested that those models, which for the most part incorporated autoregressive expectations, were excessively reduced-form and backward-looking in nature and thus insensitive to changes in economic structure and the policy process.", "In addition, some researchers observed that simple time-series models often produced better forecasts than the large macromodels of that period.", "One prescription was to focus on uncovering, at a more fundamental level, the structural parameters of the economy.", "Needless to say, this task has proven to be a very tall order that has yet to be filled.", "Partly in response to these difficulties, a substantial body of research focused on improvements in empirical modelling, such as vector autoregressions for forecasting, and in some cases, for policy analysis.", "Each one of these approaches has proven useful, and their descendants are currently employed in various forms in central banks throughout the world.", "But as yet, none of these approaches is capable of addressing the full range of policymakers' needs.", "At various points in time, some analysts have held out hope that a single indicator variable - such as commodity prices, the yield curve, nominal income, and of course, the monetary aggregates - could be used to reliably guide the conduct of monetary policy.", "If it were the case that an indicator variable or a relatively simple equation could extract the essence of key economic relationships from an exceedingly complex and dynamic real world, then broader issues of economic causality could be set aside, and the tools of policy could be directed at fostering a path for this variable consistent with the attainment of the ultimate policy objective.", "M1 was the focus of policy for a brief period in the late 1970s and early 1980s.", "That episode proved key to breaking the inflation spiral that had developed over the 1970s, but policymakers soon came to question the viability over the longer haul of targeting the monetary aggregates.", "The relationships of the monetary aggregates to income and prices were eroded significantly over the course of the 1980s and into the early 1990s by financial deregulation, innovation, and globalization.", "For example, the previously stable relationship of M2 to nominal gross domestic product and the opportunity cost of holding M2 deposits underwent a major structural shift in the early 1990s because of the increasing prevalence of competing forms of intermediation and financial instruments.", "In the absence of a single variable, or at most a few, that can serve as a reliable guide, policymakers have been forced to fall back on an approach that entails the interpretation of the full range of economic and financial data.", "Policy is implemented through nominal and, implicitly, real short-term interest rates.", "However, reflecting the progress in economic understanding, our actions are now better informed about the pitfalls associated with relying on nominal interest rates to set policy and the important role played by inflation expectations in gauging the stance of monetary policy.", "Our appreciation of the importance of expectations has also shaped our increasing transparency about policy actions and their rationale.", "We have moved toward greater transparency at a \"measured pace\" in part because we were concerned about potential feedback on the policy process and about being misinterpreted - as indeed we were from time to time.", "I do not intend this brief and necessarily incomplete review of events to illustrate how far we have come or to despair of how far we have to go.", "Rather, I believe it demonstrates the inevitable and ongoing uncertainty faced by policymakers.", "Despite extensive efforts to capture and quantify what we perceive as the key macroeconomic relationships, our knowledge about many critical linkages is far from complete and, in all likelihood, will remain so.", "Every model, no matter how detailed or how well conceived, designed, and implemented, is a vastly simplified representation of the world, with all of the intricacies we experience on a day-to-day basis.", "Formal models are a necessary, but not sufficient, system of analysis.", "To be sure, models discipline forecasts by requiring, among many restraints, that identities are indeed equal, inventories nonnegative, and marginal propensities to consume positive.", "But we all temper the outputs of our models and test their results against the ongoing evaluations of a whole array of observations that we do not capture in either the data input or the structure of our models.", "We are particularly sensitive to observations that appear inconsistent with the causal relationships of our formal models.", "Tentative revisions of that structure are reflected in our add factors.", "Given our inevitably incomplete knowledge about key structural aspects of an ever-changing economy and the sometimes asymmetric costs or benefits of particular outcomes, the paradigm on which we have settled has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management.", "In this approach, a central bank needs to consider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about that path.", "The decisionmakers then need to reach a judgment about the probabilities, costs, and benefits of various possible outcomes under alternative choices for policy.", "The risk-management approach has gained greater traction as a consequence of the step-up in globalization and the technological changes of the 1990s, which found us adjusting to events without the comfort of relevant history to guide us.", "Forecasts of change in the global economic structure - for that is what we are now required to construct - can usefully be described only in probabalistic terms.", "In other words, point forecasts need to be supplemented by a clear understanding of the nature and magnitude of the risks that surround them.", "In effect, we strive to construct a spectrum of forecasts from which, at least conceptually, specific policy action is determined through the tradeoffs implied by a loss-function.", "In the summer of 2003, for example, the Federal Open Market Committee viewed as very small the probability that the thengradual decline in inflation would accelerate into a more consequential deflation.", "But because the implications for the economy were so dire should that scenario play out, we chose to counter it with unusually low interest rates.", "The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario.", "Moreover, the risk of a sizable jump in inflation seemed limited at the time, largely because increased productivity growth was resulting in only modest advances in unit labor costs and because heightened competition, driven by globalization, was limiting employers' ability to pass through those cost increases into prices.", "Given the potentially severe consequences of deflation, the expected benefits of the unusual policy action were judged to outweigh its expected costs."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Inflation", "Monetary policy", "Expectations", "Economic models", "Risk management", "Monetary aggregates", "Transparency", "Globalization", "Unemployment", "Interest rates"]}
