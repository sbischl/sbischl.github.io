allows agents to substitute assets in local currency to protect themselves against inflation, restraining the discretionary use of monetary policy.", "The depth of the financial system and its integration with international capital markets has a powerful disciplinary effect as it reduces incentives to follow expansionary policies (at the expense of higher inflation) as foreign capital would flow out to other markets with more predictable returns.", "Anyway, this time the effects of the financial crisis are more likely to be transmitted through the trade channel rather than the financial channel (which historically affected the most Latin America).", "However, in my view, the challenges would be coming more in the form of managing the social tensions that could come as a result of

be limited.", "Structural and seasonal factors are driving commodity markets.", "Among them, it is worth mentioning supply shocks from climate hazards and geopolitical conflicts.", "Another factor is

contagion to other economies would restrict non-speculative demand for commodities, especially oil and metals.", "And here it is necessary to distinguish between the effects on hard and soft commodities.", "Agricultural commodities would be less affected mainly because of their lower income elasticity and the relative strong fundamentals of emerging economies (and not only in China and India), where demand increased the most.", "Soft commodities accumulate increases ranging from 100% to 150% since the beginning of the century with an acceleration in 2007-2008, that is leading to historically low stock to consumption ratios; the lowest in the last three decades.", "In the cases of soy and corn, demand is consistently outpacing supply due to a hike in food consumption in the

endogenous risks.", "Food price rises can potentially lead to wage demands which, given the stickiness of this component of business costs, would result in a subsequent increase in headline

dominant theme and the risks on this front will remain skewed to the upside.", "In Argentina the monetary and financial regime has faced the most significant challenge since the crisis of 2001-2002, but when we look at the results it is clear that we definitely managed to rise to it.", "For the first time in decades regardless of external and domestic disruptions, as the ones seen in the last days, the central bank is providing monetary and financial stability, two essential public goods for sustainable development.", "We know that the country has a long history of macroeconomic instability.", "Monetary regimes have unsuccessfully shifted from one extreme to the other.", "Therefore, in an economy with precedents such as confiscation of deposits (1989, 2001), hyperinflation (1989, 1990), megadevaluations (1989, 1990, 1991, 2002), and a default on the public debt (2001), the monetary system cannot set itself an exclusive goal, ignoring the economy's idiosyncrasy and vulnerabilities.", "To achieve long-term monetary and financial stability, this historical evolution needs to be taken into account.", "Hence, the central bank must have an \"across the cycle\" view rather than a short-term one.", "Our country is still going through a transition phase typical of post-crisis periods.", "And these transition stages - where key macroeconomic variables converge to their long-term values - take time and raise enormous challenges.", "The Chilean case shows that it takes time to become a normal country.", "Unlike the cases of Brazil, Mexico or Southeast Asia, the abandonment of the convertibility regime included simultaneously an institutional breakdown, a huge devaluation, the destruction of the financial system and the default on the public debt.", "There are several examples of the normalization phase that is still taking place: monetary transmission channels are just being rebuilt, since credit to the private sector accounts for only 12 percent of the economy; far below the Latin American average.", "The experience of other emerging economies shows that consistency and gradualism in both policy design and implementation are the adequate approach during this phase.", "Therefore, patiently rebuilding the power of monetary policy is a key step towards stability.", "It is then clear that the argentine economy is simply at a different stage compared to the current situation in other Latin American countries.", "Hasty diagnosis and simplistic comparisons among the various countries' situations may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations.", "Under these circumstances, a sustainable and long-lasting reduction of inflation depends on the comprehensive, joint and coordinated action of the monetary policy, the fiscal policy, the wage policy, and the competition policy during the transition phase.", "The path is a sequential one while we build the traditional monetary tools as effective policy instruments.", "Within this framework, today's monetary and financial strategy is based on three main pillars: First, a robust and consistent monetary policy that ensures the equilibrium between supply and demand in the monetary market.", "This system is the most appropriate for an economy that still makes intensive use of relatively liquid means of payment and has a relatively low bank penetration.", "For the first time after the crisis, money supply is growing below the growth of nominal GDP, reflecting the prudential bias of our approach.", "The control of the growth in m2 is based upon a deep sterilization policy, which its key element is the issuance of bills and notes of the central bank and the development of a repo market.", "And these securities are by no means straight public debt (the central bank is not using them to finance itself).", "They reflect postponed liquidity (they will be monetized when circumstances require so as it happened in the second half of 2007).", "Second, a managed floating exchange rate regime that enables us to weather situations of financial stress - that is, a regime that provides predictability.", "We do not want to prevent variables from converging to their long-term values, but we would rather avoid excessive volatility as a source of unnecessary disturbances in economic decisions.", "On the other hand, we do not want to provide any sort of insurance that favors speculative flows.", "Third, countercyclical policies to prepare the economy against shocks.", "These include the accumulation of foreign reserves and a sound financial system that buffers turmoil, instead of spreading it.", "I cannot find a more telling proof of the reasons why we have pursued antyciclical policies - such as foreign reserve accumulation - during these years: the recent external shock we faced can be compared to the \"tequila effect\" in terms of the magnitude of the outflows, but had a mild impact on domestic variables.", "The monetary and financial system truly protected it against financial contagion.", "Another example of our risk management approach is the recovery of banking liquidity and solvency.", "Due to an improved regulatory framework, we developed a sound financial system today that acts as a \"turbulence buffer\" rather than \"amplifier\".", "Our risk management approach addressed three basic aspects to deal with the crisis: preserving sufficient liquidity, foreign exchange market stabilization, and regulatory changes to soften the impact of turbulences on the financial system.", "The liquidity stress caused by international financial volatility in the local market was dealt with through measures such as buying back part of the central bank notes directly, or auctioning floating-rate and then fixed-rate repos - distributed among institutions according to their market share, and extending their terms from 7 to 30 days.", "Regarding the fx market evolution, the right question to ask is: what would have happened under the same circumstances but with a pure floating exchange rate regime in place?", "The timely intervention curbed depreciation expectations and, thus, the potential pressure on prices with minimal use of reserves.", "Bank regulations were tailored to circumstances in order to minimize the adverse effects of the shock.", "The changes involved operational aspects (allowing the use of sovereign bonds as a collateral for repos), accounting standards (valuation of instruments held by banks to maturity to buffer the impact on balance sheets), and liquidity regulations (extension of terms to meet reserve requirements and reduction of the daily minimum cash requirement).", "All in all, central bank actions show the consistency and robustness of our strategy, which are allowing us to pass the current stress test with no stress.", "We proved to have the necessary \"artillery\" to \"buffer\" domestic variables while maintaining monetary prudence in the face of turbulences with clear symptoms of permanence in time.", "To sum up, policy makers around the globe face significant dilemmas.", "While challenges are significant, now we seem to understand that policy recipes vary from one country to the other in this complex scenario.", "This progress is, obviously, welcomed.", "Especially for us, emerging markets' policy makers, as we have to catch up with growth, deal with the tensions derived from buoyant economies and, most importantly, build institutions at the same time.", "In fact, it is more a synchronic than a sequential two-fold challenge: advancing towards the aims set to develop our economies and building institutions simultaneously.", "To implement these policies effectively, the only possible way is to keep the consistent (i mean consistent with the history and idiosyncrasies of each economy) and gradualist approach that has guided us in recent years.", "The approach that seems to be the rule rather than the exception not only in the emerging world but also all across developed countries."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance",
