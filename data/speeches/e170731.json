Settlement (RTGS) among large financial institutions, (ii) enhanced risk measurement of each bank and a more transparent financial system, (iii) lower trade costs, robustness against cyber-attacks, and less need for collateral, (iv) a stronger wealth-channel for monetary policy if more agents access financial assets and loans.", "Similarly, crowdfunding and P2P reduce systemic risk since they do not involve money creation through the conventional multiplier/maturity transformation mechanism of banks.", "While this may significantly limit the scale at which operations can develop, they can be an affordable alternative for businesses that are not covered by conventional financial institutions.", "FinTech market support tools can also contribute to financial stability to the extent that they

financial products, such as payment systems, it may be not so if people make uniformed credit or investment decisions.", "In order to address this issue, the policy response should comprise financial education (which is a long-term solution) and a proper financial consumer protection framework.", "Decentralization, choice and competition vs. operational efficiency, economies of scale and client
