players to be actively involved in the endeavor of financial inclusion.", "The authorities should continue to promote the interconnection of services, competition in the banking industry, and

been clear that many market transformations have come from social initiatives or businesses with the imagination, creativity and technology to satisfy savings, lending and payment needs.", "For
