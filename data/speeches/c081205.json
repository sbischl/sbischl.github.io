resulting in an increased volume of credit in the economy.", "This trust also will increase transparency and competition between lenders.", "Timely and accurate information on borrowers' debt profiles and repayment history enables PIs to make more informed lending decisions As the data on the system is built up, the information available will enable loan processing to become simpler and faster, collateral requirements to be streamlined, default rates to be reduced and, ultimately we believe loans shall become cheaper.", "Participating Institutions (PIs) will, therefore, be able to offer new products and offer competitive interest rates due to availability of information on customers' credit risk profiles.", "BOU in its mandated responsibility will supervise the operations of the CRB and FCS to ensure that the information collected is managed securely and responsively at all times and in accordance with the agreement which we have signed with Compuscan.", "BOU has already issued Guidelines for the operation of the CRB.", "The Guidelines specify the standards that the CRB shall implement in order to ensure a reliable mechanism to process data.", "The Bank of Uganda conducted education and sensitization campaigns in 21 districts in deepen the understanding of key stakeholders of the CRB, the FCS; and the accruing benefits of the CRB.", "create a favourable public opinion and perception about credit reference services, through the careful and strategic deployment of available media and communication resources.", "The Public awareness campaigns shall continue in order to encourage borrowers register on the FCS and to address the concerns of specific target groups, to allay fears of borrowers regarding the sharing of confidential information and to assure all stakeholders of the integrity and security of the system.", "I wish to assure the general public that we consider confidentiality and privacy of information paramount.", "Bank of Uganda, PIs and Compuscan CRB Ltd. will ensure that confidentiality and privacy are adhered to at all times.", "I wish to thank the German Development Cooperation, the people of Germany and the Government and the people of Sweden for the financial and technical support accorded to Bank of Uganda for this project.", "I also want thank the World Bank for the role they have played towards the successful establishment of the CRB and the FCS.", "I thank you very much for joining Bank of Uganda on this memorable occasion.", "It is now my honor and pleasure to invite the Chief Guest, H.
