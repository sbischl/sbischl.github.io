in credit, savings, investing, payments and so on.", "But importantly too, we intend to be right there at the frontier with regard to the common technology platforms, or the utilities that can be a very important enabler for innovation in finance -

hard to say whether the disrupters will indeed disrupt the existing financial business in a significant way.", "I think it's too early to say.", "In China, we have some major FinTech players, they are no longer new now, those like Alibaba and Tencent.", "They have become established names.", "Elsewhere it hasn't made too much of a difference yet.", "It's entirely possible that some new FinTech players will eventually make their mark as enduring brands in finance.", "But we are also likely to see the growing collaboration I have talked about, between established players and start-ups.", "It is not a zero sum game.", "And FinTech ventures are also acting as a catalyst for existing players to reengineer legacy systems.", "But most importantly, FinTech is promoting a shift from the traditional focus on products to a focus on customers.", "It's about understanding their needs, and finding a way of delivering cheaper, or more convenient and more tailored services to the customer.", "The second tension is also important, and which we must be willing to manage.", "It's the tension between allowing for experimentation in finance and preserving trust and credibility in our financial system.", "They are both important and we must be willing to manage the tension.", "There was I think, in the first wave of FinTech, a certain breathlessness in the way which new businesses were coming up, and in the way which they were perceived and talked about.", "Such as, in the (Peer-to-Peer) P2P lending platforms, where the name of the game was often to lend as quickly as you can, leveraging on investments in these FinTech companies.", "The scene is now maturing.", "Some of these new lending platforms in the US and elsewhere are now more concerned with the quality of loans they make.", "Like banks, whose business is credit underwriting, they have to be good at both data analytics and judgment.", "Most FinTech ventures, globally, have indeed not succeeded to date.", "The real stress test of any new idea in finance is the economic and credit cycle.", "But even where new players fail, they usually leave behind an idea -
