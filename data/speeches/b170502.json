not only technical issues and the associated investment, but also the important legal questions associated with operating in a highly regulated sector.", "The banks' terms of access may be determined in third-party service provider agreements that may offer different degrees of access.", "These may affect not only what types of protections and vetting are appropriate for different types of access over consumers' funds and data held at a bank in order to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations for data security and other consumer protections, but also the competitive position of the bank relative to third-party developers.", "There is a second broad type of approach in which many banks have entered into agreements with specialized companies that essentially act as middlemen, frequently described as \"data aggregators.\"", "These banks may lack the budgets and expertise to create their own open APIs or may not see that as a key element in their business strategies.", "Data aggregators collect consumer financial account data from banks, on the one hand, and then provide access to that data to fintech developers, on the other hand.", "Data aggregators organize the data they collect from banks and other data sources and then offer their own suite of open APIs to outside developers.", "By partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of developers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open APIs.", "This also allows fintech developers to build their products around the APIs of two or three data aggregators, rather than 15,000 different banks and other data sources.", "And, if agreements between data aggregators and banks are structured as data aggregators performing outsourced services to banks, the bank should be able to conduct the appropriate due diligence of its vendors, whose services to those banks may be subject to examination by safety and soundness regulators.", "Some banks have opted for a more \"closed\" approach to fintech developers by entering into individual agreements with specific technology providers or data aggregators.", "These agreements often impose specific requirements rather than simply facilitating structured data feeds.", "These banks negotiate for greater control over their systems by limiting who is accessing their data--often to a specific third party's suite of products.", "Likewise, many banks use these agreements to limit what types of data will be shared.", "For instance, banks may share information See, e.g., 12 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1861-67; Division of

responsibilities, including for data privacy and security, some consumer groups have suggested that the standards for vetting should be commonly agreed to and transparent to ensure that banks do not restrict access for competitive reasons and that consumers should be able to decide what data to make available to third-party fintech applications.", "A third set of banks may be unable or unwilling to provide permissioned access, for reasons ranging from fears about increased competition to concerns about the cost and complexity of ensuring compliance with underlying laws and regulations.", "At the very least, banks may have reasonable concerns about being able to see, if not control, which third-party developers will have access to the banking data that is provided by the data aggregators.", "Accordingly, even banks that have previously provided structured data feeds to data aggregators may decide to limit or block access.", "In such cases, however, data aggregators can still move forward to collect consumer data for use by fintech developers without the permission or even potentially without the knowledge of the bank.", "Instead, data aggregators and fintech

ability to access or use such information, we may be required to attempt to obtain the information, if at all, through end user-permissioned data scraping or other means that could be more costly and time-consuming, and less effective or efficient.", "The legal environment surrounding data scraping and similar means of obtaining access to information on third-party websites is not completely clear

whether a computer system that is logging in multiple times a day is a consumer, a data aggregator, or a cyber attack.", "For community banks with limited resources, the necessary investments in API technology and in negotiating and overseeing data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and third-party providers may be beyond their reach, especially as they usually rely on service providers for their core technology.", "Some fintech firms argue that screen scraping--which has drawn the most complaints about data security--may be the most effective tool for the customers of small community banks to access the financial apps they prefer--and thereby necessary to remain competitive until more effective broader industry solutions are developed.", "Clearly, getting these connectivity questions right, including the need to manage the consumer protection risks, is critically important.", "It could make the difference between a world in which the fintech wave helps community banks become the platforms of the future, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, a world in which fintech instead further widens the gulf between community banks and the largest banks.", "The different approaches to integrating banks into the fintech stack represent different risks and tradeoffs.", "Connectivity solutions that require intermediaries such as data aggregators and rely on screen scraping potentially create repositories of consumer credentials for hackers to target.", "Banks argue that if such a repository is breached, thousands of banks could be impacted.", "Further complicating things, because screen scrapers operate without contractual relationships with the banks from which they pull information, banks have little leverage or ability to vet the security of the screen scrapers' systems and methods or their overall risk.", "In these circumstances, some commentators have noted that if a data aggregator or third-party developer is breached, it may not be clear who would bear responsibility for any losses--the bank, the data aggregator, the fintech developer, or the consumer.", "Some third-party developers have included terms and conditions that specifically limit their liability to consumers.", "It is not clear the extent to which many consumers understand the risks involved with sharing their banking credentials, the more limited liability accepted by many third-party developers relative to their bank or credit card issuer, and the fact that the third-party developers may in turn provide those credentials to others in some instances.", "On the other side of the debate, fintech companies are concerned that banks could use their control over consumer data access in the context of bilateral contracts with data aggregators to leverage their position in order to impede competition elsewhere in the stack.", "This argument about access and competition echoes similar concerns in the smartphone arena.", "According to one banking trade organization, \"[t]his is a rich reward for a single hack, either of an aggregated database of personally identifiable information or of a single consumer's multiple accounts, makes data aggregators

"See, e.g., Lael Brainard, \"The Opportunities and Challenges of Fintech\" at the Conference on Financial Innovation at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2, 2016, engagement of multiple agencies, along with input from the private sector and other stakeholders.", "Separately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is responsible for administering national bank charters, has announced that it is exploring offering \"special purpose national bank charters\" to fintech companies.", "As envisioned by the OCC, obtaining a special purpose charter would have the practical effect of allowing certain fintech companies (companies that make loans, make payments, or accept deposits) to potentially bypass the need for connecting to a bank for certain purposes in favor of becoming licensed as banks themselves.", "The OCC's proposal raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve regarding whether charter recipients would become Federal Reserve members or have access to Federal Reserve accounts and services, such as direct access to payment systems.", "If the OCC proposal is finalized, the Federal Reserve would have to closely analyze these issues with respect to any fintech firms that express an interest in moving forward with an application.", "When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, who could have predicted that it would net billions from a game like Poke\u0301mon Go, which involved no investment, development, or advertising on Apple's part beyond opening its platform to developers?", "It is still too early to have any confidence that we know which fintech innovations will prove to be the most long- lasting or widely adopted.", "By the same token, the fintech industry is still figuring out the fundamental questions of the best ways to make the necessary connections to the banking platforms to facilitate consumers' ability to better monitor and manage their financial lives, while providing the level of data security and protection they have come to rely on from their banks.", "Change is surely coming, as financial products and services move onto interconnected platforms.", "As the sector evolves, it's important that all parties involved pay close attention not only to the technical questions, but to the requisite regulatory, policy, and legal considerations to ensure continued trust and confidence in the financial system."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
