- Second, in 2020, and again in 2022, traditional central bank tools for lending to banks were not enough to stabilise the financial system as a whole, because banks did not (or could not) on-lend to NBFIs in sufficient size, requiring central banks to reach for unconventional asset purchase and sale tools; but Third, although those operations were highly effective in restoring stability, they also posed material risks to market incentives, to public sector balance sheets, and to perceptions of the monetary stance.", "Careful tool design can mitigate these risks but may not always be able to eliminate them.", "Those experiences have spawned renewed urgency in the search for a Grand Bargain that couples heightened NBFI resilience with a set of more targeted, lower-risk central bank tools.", "Thousands of column inches have been spent analysing the problem and identifying possible solutions.", "But words are not enough lasting improvement in financial stability will only be delivered through concrete reform.", "Today I want to talk about our plans to do just that at the Bank of England, through an ambitious programme to build a new generation of lending tools to help underpin financial stability during periods of exceptional liquidity stress, channelling liquidity directly to resilient NBFIs when capacity constraints prevent banks from lending in sufficient size.", "I will focus on three specific issues: 1.", "Why we urgently need the capacity to lend to NBFIs in a stress and what the ultimate objectives of such facilities should be;

margin calls on derivatives; or temporary drying up in dealer funding.", "In such circumstances, it is preferable to backstop market functioning by lending directly to NBFIs against high quality collateral as illustrated in Figure 2 because lending offers four distinct advantages over asset purchases: monetary policy stance: secured lending for financial stability purposes is a well-recognised, longstanding part of the central bank liquidity toolkit; - It would have fewer balance sheet costs for public authorities, who would not bear the market risk of holding outright positions, could apply haircuts against default risk, and would know in advance when their exposure would unwind; - It would reduce the risks of central bank interventions creating perverse market incentives that displace broader market pricing or discourage prudent NBFI behaviours to build resilience in normal times;
