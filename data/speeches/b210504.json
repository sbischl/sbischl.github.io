uncertainties we've faced since the pandemic took hold, the economy is now positioned to grow quickly.", "In fact, with accommodative financial conditions, strong fiscal support, and widespread vaccinations, I expect that the rate of economic growth this year will be the fastest that we've experienced since the early 1980s.", "And that's not only a forecast-we are already seeing signs of this pivot to strong growth in the economic statistics, as I'll discuss in a minute.", "If this sounds like good news, that's because it is.", "But robust economic growth this year by itself isn't

Recession.", "This means we will need big jobs numbers for some time to fully get the country back to work.", "The labor market indicator that gets the most media attention is the unemployment rate.", "But that statistic may not be the best measure of the overall health of the labor market because people who temporarily drop out of the labor force don't get counted as unemployed.", "It's vital that

"EPOP is the share of the population that have jobs according to a monthly survey of households.", "Before the pandemic, when the labor market was quite strong, EPOP was about 61 percent.", "By April of last year, it had fallen nearly 10 percentage points, which translates to 25 million fewer people working-an astounding drop.", "Fortunately, EPOP has risen considerably since then, but it's still

spring's large price declines, the inflation rate has increased from the very low levels seen during the earlier stages of the pandemic.", "As the economy further reopens, these dynamics will continue to play out, and I expect inflation to run somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run goal for the remainder of this year.", "It's important not to overreact to this volatility in prices resulting from

it's clear there is a big shift in the economy, and the outlook has improved.", "But let me emphasize that the data and conditions we are seeing now are not nearly enough for the FOMC to shift its monetary policy stance.", "For these reasons, the FOMC decided last week to keep strong monetary policy support for the economy in place.", "Specifically, the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 1\u20444 percent and made no changes to its program of asset purchases.", "In thinking about adjusting its stance in the future, the FOMC has defined conditions and measures that will inform its decision-making.", "In terms of the federal funds rate, the FOMC said it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.", "Maintaining very low interest rates serves two purposes.", "First, it makes it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs, for things like opening businesses and buying homes.", "Second, low
