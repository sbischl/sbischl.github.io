the levels at which it has, historically, been most difficult to observe budgets and agreements.", "Major steps have already been taken to strengthen economic cooperation in the EU with stronger budgetary discipline and increased macroeconomic surveillance, but all the same it is essential that there is still political will to ensure that the policies pursued have a strong medium-term orientation while also dampening, not amplifying cyclical fluctuations.", "It is important to observe the spirit as well as the letter of the common rules.", "This also applies in the event of a future banking union.", "The financial crisis was succeeded by a sovereign debt crisis in the EU.", "This has revealed close negative interaction between the economy and bank finances in a number of member states.", "To prevent the credit lending from collapsing, governments have had to use public funds to support the banking sector.", "At the same time, the sovereign debt crisis has made these governments more dependent on the banks, which buy up a large share of the domestic government bonds.", "Fiscal developments have raised concerns about these member states' ability to continue to support the banking sector.", "This has had a negative impact on the banks' access to funding and reinforced the tendency for banks to reduce their lending.", "Since lower lending volumes may further curb economic activity, the economic challenges become even greater.", "In the short term, the banking union represents an attempt to break the negative interaction between governments and banks.", "The vision behind the banking union is to prevent crises like the one seen in recent years and to mitigate the impact if a crisis should, nevertheless, arise.", "The aim is to shield developments in the financial sector from developments in public finances in individual member states -
