in the Norwegian business sector remains extensive, but the management of ownership has been totally revised following the negative experience of companies in Kongsberg, Mo i Rana and Syd-Varanger.", "I would like to highlight two factors that have taken on considerable importance for economic policy.", "One of these factors is that economic agents look to the future when they make decisions about consumption and investments, wages and prices, and want to take account of economic policy not only as it is today, but also as they expect it to be tomorrow and in the future.", "This is particularly evident in foreign exchange and financial markets, where exchange and interest rates are influenced when participants shift large amounts partly on the basis of their expectations concerning economic policy and economic developments.", "Financial market expectations concerning economic policy are entirely different today from what they were 20-30 years ago.", "Behaviour can change from being very rational to herd behaviour.", "The issues that receive attention, and that govern movements in exchange and interest rates, change.", "It is thus important that the authorities do not sow doubt, but on the contrary act in a long-term and predictable manner.", "The authorities must be credible and inspire confidence.", "There must be a good match between the stated objectives of economic policy and what is actually done to achieve them.", "This is the most important reason why the implementation of monetary policy has been delegated to the central bank in Norway, as has been the case in other comparable countries.", "In Norway, the responsibility for interest rate decisions was delegated to Norges Bank in 1986.", "The other factor is the special challenges to stabilisation policy posed by petroleum revenues.", "Norway's export revenues and government revenues can be expected to be very high as long as production remains high, and as long as the global market allows producing countries to extract substantial economic rent.", "At the same time, we know from experience that revenues may vary sharply from year to year.", "As a result of the high level of earnings and fluctuations in these revenues, the most important contribution fiscal policy can make to stabilising the Norwegian economy is to provide a sound, long-term plan for the use of petroleum revenues.", "Attempts to use the central government budget to fine-tune economic activity may, at worst, have a destabilising effect if these attempts are perceived as being a departure from the long-term plan for the phasing in of petroleum revenues.", "It is necessary to show that fiscal policy can be applied symmetrically in periods of economic expansion and contraction.", "A year and a half ago, the

investment.", "Lower demand in turn curbs the rise in prices and wages.", "Higher interest rates also make it more attractive to take krone positions and borrow in foreign currency.", "As a result, higher interest rates normally lead to an appreciation of the krone.", "This reduces prices for imported goods.", "In addition, a strong krone curbs activity, profitability and the capacity to cover

therefore a reasonable time horizon for attaining the inflation target.", "It is nevertheless conceivable that in a situation with a high rate of inflation and weak economic developments, Norges Bank may decide to apply a somewhat longer time horizon than two years to reach the target of 21\u20442 per cent.", "Nor do we need to be in any hurry to raise the level of inflation in a situation where inflation is very low, while economic activity is high.", "By influencing inflation over time, monetary policy will not in itself cause unnecessary disturbances in the economy.", "A precondition for applying a longer time horizon is that financial market participants have strong confidence in low and stable inflation over time, and that wage formation has a nominal anchor.", "Flexible inflation targeting provides a framework for the use of monetary policy instruments that both ensures that the economy has a nominal anchor and allows monetary policy to smooth fluctuations in the economy that are due to changes in demand for goods and services.", "At the same time, the budgetary guidelines state that \"...[in fiscal policy] considerable emphasis must be placed on stabilising fluctuations in the economy with a view to ensuring appropriate capacity utilisation and low unemployment.", "\"2 We can see here that there is an overlap between the tasks monetary policy and fiscal policy are intended to perform.", "This naturally raises the issue of whether there is after all a need to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy decisions.", "Is there, for example, a risk of a situation arising where Norges Bank tightens monetary policy to achieve the inflation target, while at the same time the central government authorities increase the use of petroleum revenues (more than implied in the fiscal policy guideline) in order to increase employment and reduce unemployment?", "There are various factors that can prevent the interplay between monetary and fiscal policy from functioning.", "Interplay functions well when the decision-making bodies are conscious of how one body's decisions influence the decisions of the other.", "Unless this fact is recognised, a decision will not produce the result that was planned.", "The economy may move in a very undesirable direction, with high interest rates, sluggish economic growth and deterioration in the state's financial position.", "However, even without continuous coordination, a fairly good result may be achieved if fiscal policy acts as \"leader\" and monetary policy as \"follower\", to use expressions taken from game theory.", "The authorities determine fiscal policy knowing how monetary policy will react.", "Today's flexible inflation targeting establishes a firm framework for monetary policy and provides clear guidelines on how monetary policy is to respond in different situations.", "The fiscal policy authorities can internalise the monetary policy response pattern.", "This is only natural, since the mandate for monetary policy was laid down by the Government and the Storting.", "In other words, the conditions exist for delegating the interest rate decision, but the central bank's response pattern must be known, so that the fiscal authorities can take this into account.", "When the response pattern in monetary policy is known and remains unchanged over time, the social partners can also take any monetary policy response into account when wages are being determined.", "The \"leader\" in this interplay - the social partners - can take the \"follower's\" - Norges Bank's - response into account.", "This view is most relevant in centralised wage formation.", "In decentralised wage formation, monetary policy will instead affect wage growth via market mechanisms by stabilising aggregate demand.", "The current monetary policy guidelines will function well whether wages are determined centrally, locally or individually.", "The outcome of this year's wage settlement, and the debate that followed, may indicate that the social partners have not yet internalised the response pattern in monetary policy ensuing from the mandate laid down by the Government and the Storting.", "Perhaps a stumbling block has been the choice of wage settlements at industry level and the large wage increases for employees outside the two largest employer/employee organisations (NHO and LO).", "On the other hand, the choice of settlement type is probably influenced by the participants' assessment of the economic outlook.", "The high wage growth awarded to groups whose wages are determined through individual agreements indicates that the labour market has been tight.", "However, the rise in salaries for white-collar workers may also reflect weak cost control in enterprises and organisations following a long period of expansion.", "A precondition for interplay that functions well is that monetary policy is known and remains firm.", "The best thing Norges Bank can do to contribute to good interplay between the various components of economic policy and wage formation is therefore to be transparent about its analyses and assessments of economic developments.", "Labour costs in Norway and
