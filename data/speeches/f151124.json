stock in the short term.", "Limiting the amount of new loans therefore has a relatively slow impact on the debt stock.", "A reduction in tax relief on mortgage interest can affect all borrowers - and could have potentially major effects on indebtedness To influence the development of household debt we should also consider fiscal policy measures, which in this context means changes to various housing-related taxes.", "One example is changes to tax relief on mortgage interest.", "The advantage of this kind of measures is that it has the potential to influence the entire debt stock.", "The incentive to take out new loans decreases, and the costs linked to existing loans are also affected.", "In terms of the simple debt equation above, the amortisation rate could therefore rise on existing loans (the incentive to amortise increases if future borrowing costs rise) while new borrowing would be subdued.", "The debt-to-income limit is an effective complement to the loan-to-value limit There are many indications that the distribution of debt is also significant in terms of risks.", "As I mentioned earlier, several international studies show that highly-indebted households reduce their consumption more than households with lower debts when there is a fall in housing prices, for example.", "Measures which set an upper limit for individual household indebtedness can therefore be effective in terms of reducing the risk of weak macroeconomic growth, even though the effects of the total debt-to-income ratio would be limited.", "The Riksbank's previous analysis has also shown that a debt-to-income limit (that is to say a limit for how large debt can be in relation to disposable income) could be an effective complement to the current loan-to-value limit.", "This is due to the fact that incomes grow in a more stable way than housing prices.", "Whenever housing prices increase sharply, there is a risk that debts will continue to increase in relation to incomes if the only limitation is a loan-tovalue limit.", "A debt-to-income limit is also more effective in terms of preventing interest payments taking up too large a share of incomes in the future.", "So those are the measures we could take.", "But what would happen to household indebtedness if no further measures were taken?", "A few different scenarios for household indebtedness Normally, the Riksbank creates forecasts regarding household indebtedness three years ahead.", "Making an assessment any further ahead than this would involve considerable uncertainty.", "However, in order to give us an idea about what could happen to household indebtedness beyond the forecast horizon three years ahead, we have made a rough estimate of developments over the coming 10 years, which uses our forecast for the coming three years as a starting point.", "We assess that the rate of increase of indebtedness will slow somewhat when the repo rate gradually begins to be raised (according to our forecast for the first six months of 2017) and slowly rises to a normal level.", "In the Financial Stability Report from the spring, we published an extensive analysis of Swedish household indebtedness.", "One conclusion drawn from this was that international studies and experiences from the Swedish 1990s crisis indicate that if indebtedness approaches 180-210 per cent, measured as a proportion of disposable income, risks in the Swedish economy are heightened.", "This is due to households' interest expenditure - at a high rate of interest than today's - becoming so high that it could lead to a major fall in demand and ultimately a crisis.", "It is clear that we are approaching a critical level with leaps and bounds (see Figure 11).", "Broken red line shows an estimate of

Riksbank.", "We have also developed examples to broadly assess how different measures influence the development of household indebtedness, which can then illustrate what is required to help this indebtedness level out.", "Finansinspektionen's proposal in the spring of an amortisation requirement means that new mortgage borrowers with loan-to-value ratios above 50 per cent must amortise 2 per cent of the loan per year down to 70 per cent, and then 1 per cent per year down to 50 per cent.", "However, we should be clear that this requirement looks mild by international standards.", "In most countries, the loan has a clear maturity date, which specifies when the debt is to be repaid, often between 20 and 40 years, and the proportion of interest-only loans is often low.", "If the home is not revalued, the Finansinspektionen proposal for an amortisation requirement means that households with a loan-to-value ratio of 85 per cent would need to amortise down to a loan-to-value ratio of 50 per cent within 32 years.", "We see in Figure 12 that the amortisation requirement, in its present draft form, will have little impact when it comes to slowing down total indebtedness in the coming years.", "As I mentioned, it is the case for all loan-limiting macroprudential policy measures (for example loan-to-value limits, amortisation requirements and debt-to-income limits) which only affect new borrowers that they are relatively slow to have an effect on the debt stock.", "For this reason, such measures have a minor effect in many cases on total indebtedness over a 10-year period,

halved that we will see a clear slowdown of household indebtedness over the coming 10 years (see Figure 13).", "Halving tax relief on mortgage interest may sound dramatic, but at the current low

large amount of the effect within 10 years (see Figure 13).", "Our calculations indicate that the extent of the effect would be as great as if tax relief were halved.", "Debt-to-income limits have already been introduced in the United Kingdom and Ireland.", "In the UK, it has been stated that a maximum of 15 per cent of the banks' new mortgages may have a loan-to-income ratio exceeding 450 per cent, while in Ireland it has been stated that a maximum of 20 per cent of the banks' new mortgages may have a loan-to-income ratio exceeding 350 per cent.", "In the UK, the exempted share is expressed in terms of the number of new mortgages, while in Ireland it is expressed in terms of the volume of new mortgages.", "It is not easy to calculate the effects of exempting, for instance, 15 per cent from a rule, but in Figure 13 we have tried to make such an estimate.", "We can see that the effect is somewhat smaller than if there is no exemption, but the difference is not major.", "There is already a loan-to-value limit in Sweden.", "One alternative could be to lower this from the current level of 85 per cent.", "But as I mentioned, there is a clear point to complementing the

"Lowering the limit to 80 per cent would lead, over a 10-year period, to about the same effect as the proposed amortisation requirement, and even lowering it to 75 per cent would result in a smaller effect looking 10 years ahead than a debt-to-income limit of 600 per cent.", "It is clear from what I have said so far that it is hard to find an individual measure which could prevent indebtedness from increasing from a 10-year perspective.", "A combination of measures may therefore be needed.", "One example of a \"package of measures\", which I have discussed on previous occasions, includes an amortisation requirement, halved tax relief and a debt-to-income limit of 400 per cent.", "A summary of the effects of these measures offers a very rough estimate of the total effect, and indicates in

reduced risks in the longer run, against the costs, in the form of lower demand and GDP in the short run.", "In this context another aspect of tax relief on mortgage interest can be mentioned, namely that it currently represents a cost for the state.", "According to an analysis carried out in June this year by the National Institute of Economic Research, the costs to the state of tax relief will increase considerably when interest rates rise: from around SEK 23 billion to 60 billion (1 per cent of GDP) in 10 years.", "Reduced tax relief could therefore improve the state's finances quite
