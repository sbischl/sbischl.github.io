{"sentences": ["Shri Gopalakrishna, Director, CAFRAL; fellow bankers and participants of the Program on Financial Crimes Management!", "At the outset, let me mention that this is the third occasion I am speaking on frauds in as many months.", "In November 2016, I spoke on \"Fraud Risk Management in Banks - Major Concerns and 12 Sutras for Bankers\" and last month I spoke on \"Fraud Risk Management - Forging Partnership between Public and Private sector banks\" in which I focused on the 'contemporary scene', 'challenges' and 'what more we could do' to strengthen the defences against frauds in collective manner.", "It cannot be sheer coincidence that I am speaking on this issue so frequently.", "It has probably to do with both- a sharp increase in number of frauds in the banking sector

in the event of cyber incidents is a must in today's environment.", "The old adage, prevention is better than cure applies to cyber security as well.", "Banks need to have a robust defence mechanism

related to cyber security that I wish the participants to deliberate upon during the course of the Seminar and one issue for the policy makers to ponder over.", "The rate at which technology is undergoing a change is overwhelming.", "Contrary to that, human beings are slow learners and slower to adapt to changes, especially if it is a new technology.", "Against this background, the question that we need to ask ourselves is whether there is a need to employ newer and newer technology enabled products at a fast pace or are we merely doing this since competition has done so?", "Are you convinced that the new product would significantly enhance the efficiencies & enable better customer experience?", "My point is frequent introduction of new technology may only end up stretching human resources beyond their capabilities and might eventually prove counter-productive.", "One trend that has been increasingly witnessed in recent instances of cyber fraud is introduction of malware in the computer systems by the fraudsters that sit ideal for days and months together before striking.", "These malwares are also known to self -destruct after they have achieved their desired objective.", "This is a really scary situation and hence, we need to be not only on continuous guard to identify the vulnerabilities that exist in our systems and to plug them but also scout for innocuous looking unknown programmes/malware from time to time.", "c. The next aspect that I wish to highlight is around human behaviour.", "We have always known banking to be a relationship built on trust.", "However, when we talk about cyber security I tend to believe that 'zero trust' is the way to address it.", "What I am hinting at is that physical and logical access controls must work as designed and only such employees who 'need to know' the intricacies of the application software/programmes must have access to them.", "Finally, I want to raise the issue of cyber literacy for consideration of the policy makers.", "As we go whole hog into the digital world, it is imperative that the employees as well as customers are cyber literate.", "I understand that some countries like Israel, have introduced cyber awareness in their high school curriculum.", "Perhaps, we also need to think on similar lines.", "With moderate levels of general literacy in our country, this could be a tall order, but nevertheless it is a goal worth pursuing relentlessly.", "Let me now move from the cyber space to an earthly level.", "Advances related frauds 16.", "During the FY 2016, advances related frauds constituted nearly 92% of the total frauds reported by all banks.", "This was more pronounced in case of PSU banks and less in case of private and foreign banks.", "In almost all the cases, we observed that the exposure had got seasoned as an NPA for 3 to 4 years before the borrower was declared as fraudulent.", "As a consequence, the gap between the date of occurrence and detection has been widening.", "Further, the gap between first bank and the last bank reporting the borrowal account as fraud to RBI is also very long.", "What is the concern here?", "As you know 'fraud' is a criminal offence and any delay on the part of the bankers in initially red flagging an exposure and subsequently declaring it as a fraud will have far reaching implications on the employee conduct and internal governance standard.", "Banks and bankers could be charged for abetting the criminal offence.", "My call to you therefore, is to identify and declare the account as fraud without wasting time.", "The best course of action would be to follow the instructions in letter and spirit and take a responsible and pro-active stand while attending consortium meetings.", "As a penal measure borrowers who have committed a fraud in the account are debarred from availing bank finance from banks/FIs/NBFCs etc., for a period of five years from the date of full payment of the defrauded amount.", "After this period, it is for individual institutions to take a call on whether to lend to such a borrower.", "Anecdotal evidence and our transaction testing on the ground has suggested that this instruction is not always being followed.", "Recently, we had come across a case where a bank had extended a 'hand holding operation' facility in case of very large fraud account.", "Frauds in the area of cheque cloning continue to be one of the areas of concern for us.", "We have come across cases where though the original cheques remained in the custody of the customer, cheques with the same series were presented and encashed by fraudsters.", "RBI has issued guidelines in the issue to the banks in November 2014 and it is necessary that the instructions are followed to prevent fraudulent practices.", "In most of the PSU banks the demographic profile of the employees is very unfavourable and massive recruitment is happening across the banks at the entry level.", "While banks are augmenting the HR stock, most of them do not have the capacity to train, build and absorb them.", "In the process the banks are adding significant people risk.", "Another form in which people risk can manifest is on account of gap in understanding of technology between two sets of employees, colloquially called \"digital immigrants\" (older generation) and the \"digital natives\" (the newer generation).", "Especially in the public sector banks which suffer from a \"Missing Middle\", the knowledge gap between the supervisors and supervised in the area of digital can be very stark and might result in loose controls.", "It is, therefore, important for the Board and Top Management of banks to look for ways to mitigate the people risk as part of the overall Fraud Risk Management Framework.", "I am of the view that only eternal vigilance can bring us closer to a fraud free eco-system.", "At the cost of repetition, I would like to reiterate the 12 important messages/sutras for bankers for Bankers that I had outlined in another seminar which according to me are key to a better fraud risk management.", "Like Sutras, which are short pithy instructive sayings, these messages are simple and straightforward.", "Sutra 1: Have a ROBUST Fraud risk identification, event reporting, control, allocation and mitigation framework.", "'Four eyes principle' must be followed in all sensitive areas without compromise.", "Sutra 2: Follow the 5 'Cs\" of CREDIT -
