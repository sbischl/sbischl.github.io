done is to zoom in on the basics of daily poverty to explore how poor people manage their money.", "Let me cite a paragraph from the review of the book in the Ten years ago, the authors of this unusual study began collecting detailed yearlong \"financial diaries\" from households in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa, with a focus on those living on less than two dollars a day per person.",

Identification Number (UID) Project of Government of India, headed by Nandan Nilekani.", "Although the main aim of UID is to provide a unique ID number for everyone in the country, Aadhar (\u201a \u0327s\u030c \u0327 \u0327\u00a3) will be a powerful instrumentality for helping the poor establish their identity to meet the banks' KYC norms.", "This will reduce cash and non-cash transaction costs both to the banks and to the potential customers.", "The UID is another powerful illustration of harnessing technology for the benefit of the poor.", "Fourth, we have asked every domestic commercial bank - public and private sector - to prepare its own Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) and have it approved by its Board.", "Our aim in this respect is two fold.", "First, each bank should have ownership of its FIP.", "Second, we want each bank to build on its comparative advantage.", "We want banks to be innovative and entrepreneurial and try out their own models and experiments consistent with their business models.", "The FIPs are meant to be rolled out over the next three years and are required to include indicators for performance evaluation.", "RBI has held meetings with the chairmen of banks to review the FIPs prepared by them.", "These meetings, chaired by Deputy Governor Dr. Chakrabarty, have enabled a clearer understanding of issues in financial inclusion.", "The discussions revealed that the main challenge is to ensure that the no-frill accounts actually become operational.", "Because of dire poverty, the account or the branch services are rarely or minimally used.", "Banks agreed that, for the FIPs to succeed: scalable technology solutions should be in place; the RRBs should also be core-banking enabled; business correspondent model coupled with biometric technology needs to be performance criteria of staff should include achievement of financial inclusion connectivity issues need to be sorted out by service providers.", "Role of technology 19.", "Let me now revert to the role and importance of technology for financial inclusion.", "Financial inclusion efforts to date have been driven through two distinct channels: smart cards and mobile phones.",

important not to miss the wood for the trees.", "The priority clearly has to be to facilitate \"inclusion\" first.", "\"Interoperability\" is no doubt important but it can follow.", "Clearly inclusion cannot wait for interoperability to happen.", "The second issue relates to the choice of a model for mobile banking.", "World over, there are two distinct models - the \"bank-led\" model and the \"mobile operator-led\" model.", "The Reserve Bank has a clear preference for the bank-led model.", "This is so for at least two important reasons.", "First, we want our financial inclusion to be more than just a remittance facility; we want our customers to get minimum services like deposit insurance, access to affordable credit and the payment system which only banks can offer.", "Second, given the growing concerns about money laundering and financing of terrorism, a bank led model is decidedly safer and more sustainable.", "We do recognize that mobile telephony has an important role in the value chain and we are keen that mobile service providers collaborate with banks to provide value added services.", "Technology in banking - the way forward 21.", "Let me now look ahead and flag a few important issues in the use of technology in banking and how it can be an aid to value creation.", "The deepening of the use of technology in banking requires that it be accompanied by good \"IT governance\" which is a sub-set of good corporate governance.", "Banks must put in place robust risk management systems encompassing effective infrastructure, security policies, incident reporting and business continuity management.", "Also, these management systems must be subject to regular review and monitoring.", "Needless to say, as businesses expand, the risk from a failure in IT systems expands disproportionately faster, reinforcing the need for good IT governance.", "There have been instances where some banks could not participate for more than a day in the NEFT/RTGS product offerings for several reasons - problems in the internet channel interface going unnoticed, data clean-up in the database not getting adequate attention, ignoring hardware sizing aspects, delaying the decision to move to the back-up site, and the like.", "Greater management attention can easily fix these flaws.", "That is why IT governance is important.", "The second priority issue on the way forward is the quality control of data and its use for improving banking efficiency.", "The hierarchy of transition is from data to information to knowledge to wisdom.", "Technology enables banks to collect voluminous data pertaining to customers and transactions.", "As most bank branches, including those of RRBs, are coming under the core banking platform, it is important not to be swamped by this deluge but to process the data into useful information for management through robust MIS and decision support systems.", "This becomes particularly relevant in the context of internal rating models and fraud detection techniques where extraction of patterns from data is the sine-qua-non.", "The Reserve Bank attaches a lot of importance to ensuring the quality of data, its processing into useful information and the flow of that information to the appropriate level.", "To streamline this, the Reserve Bank has formed a group comprising experts from banks, IDRBT, IBA and RBI to study the information reporting system of banks and to suggest an approach for automated data flow in a straight-through manner from the source systems of banks to the Reserve Bank.", "The next priority issue on my list is protection of information and customer confidentiality.", "There are growing concerns about the increase in cyber crimes, phishing related frauds, identify frauds and misuse of customer information and the like.", "Threats from skimming, sniffing, spamming, spoofing, etc., are all increasing.", "Some of you may be aware of recent instances of several people getting defrauded through the so called prize winning schemes where names of prominent institutions are being used to lure remittances of large amounts of money by promising millions in return.", "I am informed that these monies are often being paid into banks' accounts by gullible people and then siphoned out.", "Even if such accounts are opened after following KYC norms, the unusual pattern of these transactions can be easily discerned if banks use appropriate technologies for this purpose.", "It is in this context that in our Monetary Policy Statement for 2010-11, we proposed setting up a working group on information security, electronic banking, technology risk management, and tackling cyber frauds.", "Next on my list is the several ways IT models can be used to improve the efficiency of banking - for example, for credit appraisal using the score card model, for determination of provisioning to be made against loans and for handling millions of low value accounts without compromising on underwriting and supervisory standards.", "Last, and possibly the most important on my list of priority issues is the need to guard against what can be called a \"technology barrier\" between the bank and the customer.", "As we all recognize, technology is a great enabler and provides us huge opportunities for making banking more efficient and more inclusive.", "At the same time, it is also faceless, and this absence of a \"human touch\" can be quite intimidating, if not threatening, to those just entering the banking network.", "Banks should, therefore, take extra care to ensure that the poor are not driven away from banking because the technology interface is unfriendly.", "This requires training the banks' frontline staff and managers as well as business correspondents on the human side of banking.", "IDRBT as facilitator 27.", "Before I close, I will be amiss if I do not acknowledge the impressive contribution of IDRBT to \"techno-banking\", if I may use such a phrase now.", "IDRBT's initiatives in developing the INFINET, its contribution to the establishment of a messaging platform (SFMS) and a shared ATM-network (NFS) have added immense value to our banking sector.", "IDRBT's performance as a certification authority, as an R&D centre and as an institution for training and education have marked great advances in the Indian financial sector.", "The Rangarajan Committee which had gone into the issue of repositioning IDRBT for the next decade has since made valuable recommendations.", "These relate to: need for thrust on research and development activities with a clear focus on the areas of research that should be taken up in the next 3 to 5 years time; revamping education and training activities with the aim to develop technically competent and in-house expertise in banks to efficiently supervise and manage technology-intensive resources like data centres, data recovery centres, corporate network, etc.", "; becoming a member of global technology standard setting bodies active in the area \uf0b7 developing a cadre of faculty focussing on technology requirements of the banking industry.", "We are working on implementing these recommendations.", "As I noted earlier, Indian banks have come a long way in using technology to improve the reach and efficiency of banking.", "What they have done is laudable because they have adapted the best international technology practices to the Indian situation.", "I want to compliment them for what they have achieved and for their efforts towards addressing the challenges on the way forward.", "We are gathered here today to recognize outstanding performance in the use of technology in banking.", "Hearty congratulations to the winners today.", "I hope these awards will encourage further innovations and competition towards improving efficiency.", "I also wonder if we can benchmark banks' performance in the use and adoption of technology against some international standards, especially in the area of financial inclusion.", "I would urge IDRBT to work on this.", "Finally, I want to compliment Shri Sambamurthy and his dedicated team of faculty and staff at IDRBT for their important contributions to the financial sector.", "My thanks also to the members of the Governing Council of the Institute whose expertise and guidance has been the backbone of IDRBT's performance and achievements."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
