but challenges for conduct supervision come from the nature of the analyses required.", "While prudential supervision can typically rely on a quantitative approach, the protection of financial consumers may require a judgment-based analysis of the quality of customer relation arrangements.", "Sanctions are of course an essential deterrence tool, and (again, differently from prudential supervision) may be complemented by the power to impose the reimbursement of sums unduly charged (which directly favor damaged consumers, differently from sanctions).", "Product intervention powers may further enrich the supervisory toolbox, preventing harmful products from being distributed.", "In addition to public enforcement, effective customer protection may also be based on private enforcement tools.", "Complaint management, and effective alternative dispute resolution (ADR) schemes enabling customers to seek redress, represent relevant tools.", "Public authorities may have a role in establishing, or at least promoting, ADR schemes for the financial system.", "Last but not least, financial education programs may obviously complement regulation and enforcement in ensuring effective consumer protection.", "Overall, the work of FinCoNet over these years has become extremely relevant in supporting the comparison and evaluation of supervisory instruments, the dissemination of good practices, the analyses of critical issues, the formulation of policy proposals.", "The Bank of Italy has also devoted a great effort to the development of a comprehensive consumer protection framework in the Italian banking system.", "In 2009 we established a Banking Ombudsman.", "In 2014, we established a new Directorate responsible for business conduct supervision and in charge of financial education initiatives.", "Since then, we have issued several Guidelines for financial intermediaries; the Ombudsman scheme has given solutions to a very large number of complaints filed by customers; banks and other financial intermediaries reimbursed over \u20ac 300 million to customers; our financial education activities reach more than 100.000 students every year.", "However, despite the steps taken so far, we are aware that we are still in the \"early age\" of business conduct supervision.", "That is why FinCoNet meetings are important: we believe that comparing practices, sharing knowledge and experiences are essential to ensure financial consumer protection.", "The agenda of this two days meeting is very rich.", "You will be able to analyze and exchange views on several relevant issues: the tools available and their effectiveness, the evolving context in your respective jurisdictions, the use of new technology in market conduct supervision.", "New technologies in the financial system challenge regulators and supervisors, they open up new streams of products and services in a fast-changing market.", "The rise of \"open banking\" and the increased accessibility of bank accounts by third parties represent the most visible innovations in this field and are already contributing to reshaping the financial landscape.", "Conduct supervisors must intensify the use of data and algorithms to increase the efficiency and scope of supervisory actions.", "On Friday, the International Seminar jointly organized by FinCoNet and the Bank of Italy will provide useful insights on behavioral finance, shedding a light on how this approach can be embedded in supervisory activity."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Business conduct supervision", "Financial consumer protection", "Product governance", "Financial intermediaries", "Disclosure requirements", "Supervisory tools", "Private enforcement", "Financial education", "Behavioral finance", "New technologies"]}
