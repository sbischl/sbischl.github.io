imperfections such as information asymmetries, lack of sensitivity to gender and redistributive dimensions of resources and wealth and high transaction costs etc.", "; (ii) high price and non-price barriers such as lack of credit history and collateral and connection; and (iii) other constraints such as lack of literacy and entrepreneurial skills, etc.", "Over the years, there has been

few core or necessary and sufficient conditions that are needed to maximize the benefits derived from such strategy.", "At the outset, it is critical to understand the size and dimension of financial exclusion.", "Despite complexities of estimation, a recent study3 concluded that average level of financial exclusion, as measured by the percentage of the adult population with access to an account

despite a relatively robust economic base, particularly among larger countries.", "To design strategy and policies, there is further need to understand what the reasons for exclusion are?", "Is it voluntary or pure denial of services and what the barriers of access to finance are?", "General evidence does suggest that in developing countries financial penetration is quite low because of (i) geographical exclusion since physically banks coverage of population is low (18,000 persons per bank branch in South Asia and 12,000 in South East Asia), the limited reach in rural areas where larger proportion of population resides, (ii) cash based economy given issues surrounding disclosure, identification, and taxation etc., (iii) low financial literacy, and (iv) lack of collateral and credit history of micro borrowers and micro-entrepreneurs.", "Conceptually, financial inclusion should focus on Provision of full range of financial services i.e.", "going beyond credit to deposit and

go beyond the saturated and right in the corner markets to the excluded and far flung markets and offers appropriate products to clients with different requirements.", "Commercialization of microfinance business has a massive impact on enhancing scale of outreach.", "For instance, in Latin America, the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) opted to transform themselves into licensed financial institutions, together with specially licensed financial institutions that they were able to provide almost 45% of the microfinance services.", "Donor support can be useful provided it paves the way for commercialization and private sector involvement in microfinance, either alone or as part of private-public sector consortiums, by brokering new banking relationships, by offering

donors, will be providing substantial financial and technical support to Pakistan's financial inclusion programs.", "Based on experience and research, critical conditions for financial sustainability of financial inclusion programs are: (i) Economies of scale: Given direct relationship between profitability and scale of operations, larger banks/MFIs are able to evolve business models and growth

and technology which together offer ease and efficiency in service delivery.", "These factors enhance ability of firms to expand and compete to stay in power.", "(ii) Proper Funding Mechanism: Sustainability requires that MFIs largely rely on deposit mobilization to finance their businesses.", "In initial stages of development however MFIs end up developing alliances with the commercial

Foundation and the National Rural Support Program) are in process of structuring their transformation.", "(iv) Strategic Alliances of MFIs with financial markets: Developing strategic alliances and other partnerships are increasingly becoming the ways in which MFIs can engage with a wide variety of financial market participants.", "As these arrangements capitalize on the comparative advantages of vastly different institutions, they can take many different forms.", "Where MFI cannot achieve organic growth they have two options: (i) these include \"strategic alliances,\" mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and contractual arrangements, or (ii) alliance with commercial banks to set up and launch MF operations.", "Developing supportive infrastructure for nurturing financially healthy (v) MFIs/MFBs: It is critical that countries work towards developing proper rating agencies and credit information bureaus to assess risks associated with microfinance operations and their clients.", "(vi) Greater diversification and sales volume: The economics of retail financial services drives managers to evolve a set of standardized products and services to expand the volume of

to organize for collective action for common goals and objectives to reach poor, women and the disadvantaged.", "Community Investment Fund (CIF) provides a useful tool to reach the poorest decile of population.", "The experience of successful CIFs demonstrate that savings-based and Self Help Groups (SHG) based CIFs are some of the most successful models for achieving better social outcomes on sustainable basis.", "Externally funded CIFs have lower odds of success as they have to swim against the stream of natural incentives of group members.", "It is prudent for external funders to provide support services to CIF instead of injecting loan capital.", "(ii) Targeted support programs.", "Most pertinent in this context would be the Community and Rural Support programs which catalyze employment opportunities.", "Whether they are by way of subsidized lending program MFIs (or those who support them) should be able to report on how (or whether) the stated goals they have promised (i.e., improved earnings, reduced vulnerability, increased empowerment, etc.)", "(iii) Properly structured credit enhancements: Design credit enhancement in a way that MFIs use of the facility is subject to fulfilling social sustainability criteria to yield better social outcomes.", "(iv) Social performance demands keeping a close watch on the financial bottom line through better retention of
