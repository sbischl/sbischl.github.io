individual, who usually has limited resources and skills to appreciate the complexities of financial dealings with financial intermediaries on matters relating to personal finance on a day-to-day basis.", "The process of economic reforms, which includes deregulation and marketisation, should have educating and empowering the common person to participate in the financial marketplace with knowledge and confidence, as a critical component of public policy.", "The need for financial education is felt in the developed and the developing countries alike.", "In the developed countries, the increasing number and complexity of financial products, the continuing shift in responsibility for providing social security from governments and financial institutions to individuals, and the growing importance of individual retirement planning make it imperative that financial education be provided to all.", "In the developing countries also, the increasing participation of a growing number of consumers in newly developing financial markets will necessitate the provision of financial education - if these markets are to expand and operate efficiently.", "In addition, the substantial growth of international transactions during the last decade, resulting from new technologies and the growing international mobility of individuals, makes the improvement in financial education, increasingly, an international concern.", "From a regulatory perspective, financial education empowers the common person and thus reduces the burden of protecting the common person from the elements of market failure, attributable to, de facto, information asymmetries.", "For example, the emphasis on market discipline, as one of the three pillars of banking regulation, especially under Basel II, is best served by participation of financially literate bank customers in the financial marketplace.", "Financial education can make a difference not only in the quality of life that individuals can afford, but also the integrity and quality of markets.", "It can provide individuals with basic tools for budgeting, help them to acquire the discipline to save and thus, ensure that they can enjoy a

near-term obligations and maximise their longer-term financial well-being.", "Financial education is also an integral component of customer protection.", "Despite concerted efforts, the current state of transparency coupled with the difficulty of consumers in identifying and understanding the fine print from the large volume of convoluted information, leads to an information asymmetry between the financial intermediary and the customer.", "For example, customers are often penalised for minor violations in repayments, although they have limited redressal mechanisms to rectify deficiencies in service by banks, rendering the banker-customer relationship one of unequals.", "In this relationship, it is the principal, that is, the depositor, who is actually far less powerful than the agent, that is, the bank.", "The representations received in regard to levying of unreasonably high service or user charges and enhancement of user charges without proper and prior intimation, and the growing number of customer complaints against the banks, also testify to this fact.", "In this context, financial education may help to prevent vulnerable consumers from falling prey to financially disquieting credit arrangements.", "There are however, issues that would need to be addressed upfront in the Indian context.", "First, the regional profile in our country is diversified, with people across different regions being typically conversant in their vernacular languages.", "Second, there exists a wide divergence in literacy levels across States.", "Thus, for instance, in several States

"Third, the dependency ratio varies markedly across states.", "Fourth, within a State, there are marked differences between rural and urban areas.", "Fifth, there is also a perceptible variation in the penetration of banking across regions.", "Taken together, these unique conditions in our country create a role for the public policy to devise enabling mechanisms to improve the levels of financial education, reckoning the regional differences.", "To the extent the common person is better able to understand and appreciate the need for financial education, the task of the financial regulators is greatly simplified, lowering the overall costs of regulation.", "Possible approaches It is an imperative of increasing globalisation that the difference in the pace of growth of the financial sector and financial education be minimized.", "There are several ways to go about this process.", "For purposes of illustration, these can be classified as institutional mechanisms, delivery mechanisms and decentralisation of efforts.", "Institutional mechanisms As regards the institutional mechanism, there is near consensus on the fact that any attempt at expanding the outreach of financial education needs to start at the grass-roots.", "Present day school pass-outs need to be a lot more financially literate than their parents were, if they are to manage their personal finances successfully through life.", "In addition, universities and business schools have an important role in training financial specialists able to provide the public with high quality advice on financial matters.", "Yet another channel for imparting financial education could be the workplace where it can reach most of the working adults.", "It would, therefore, be a potent mechanism for providing information about a number of financial services such as retirement schemes and insurance.", "The role of financial institutions in providing financial education, not only to the clients but also to their own staff, needs to be better defined and further promoted.", "More information is needed at both international and national levels on good programmes and practices and on the ways to promote access to financial services by harnessing the role of non-government organisations (NGOs).", "International organisations are well-positioned to coordinate international surveys and studies on the various aspects of financial education, to evaluate the comparative efficiency of various financial education programmes, and to develop guidelines and good practices for policymakers for implementation.", "International agencies can also provide a forum where countries can compare and discuss strategies to educate consumers about financial issues.", "Several governments and central banks, either directly or indirectly, are actively involved in the provision of financial education about consumer credit, investment, and other financial issues, often as part of a public policy campaign to improve the protection of individual borrowers and investors, for instance, as part of the ongoing pension reform efforts.", "Exchange of experiences amongst central banks would thus be productive.", "Delivery mechanisms The delivery mechanisms for imparting financial education can be manifold.", "However, the content and delivery of financial education should correspond to the needs of specific sub-groups of consumers that is, the young or elderly, less or better educated, well- or ill-informed.", "Presentations, lectures, conferences, symposia, training courses and seminars can be actively utilised for this purpose.", "Second, publications in diverse forms, including books, brochures, magazines, booklets/pamphlets, direct mail documents, can also be useful in this regard.", "Third, leveraging information technology through concerted media campaigns using all possible avenues of mass communication can be expected to impart greater efficacy to the process.", "Other methods include advisory services from institutions, including the fast growing telecommunication services.", "Not only the supply of financial education, but also the demand is very important.", "Most delivery channels are good for those who are already interested in particular topics.", "An important challenge is to create demand for financial information and education.", "Decentralisation of efforts Given the unique conditions in our country, any attempt at expanding the outreach of financial education should take cognisance of the role of regional differences in language, workforce and penetration of finance.", "Thus, banks with strong presence across different regions could explore the possibility of introducing a local-language based web-site providing details of facilities for customers.", "Second, in recent times, the explosion of the internet has altered the relationship between financial organisations and its clientele.", "Organisations can examine ways to better communicate with both the prospective and existing clients by enriching the information content of their website on the lines of those practiced in the mature markets.", "Third, credit counselling can be a potent tool for financial entities to expand the reach of financial education.", "Fourth, it might be of interest for reputed organisations like the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) to conduct surveys at periodic intervals to ascertain the degree of consumer awareness about financial products and services.", "The findings emanating from such studies could be shared with financial entities to enable them to address the gaps in their service delivery and promote informed decision-making.", "Fifth, several bodies, such as the Financial Planning Standards Board of India (FPSBI), a professional standards setting body constituted with public-private enterprise, are reportedly making proactive efforts to uniformly regulate personal financial planning practitioners.", "Much more of such efforts will be required to guide the development and promotion of standards for financial planning professionals to benefit and protect the public in the country.", "The RBI, on its part, wishes to advance the cause of financial education in our country as part of an overall strategy.", "The strategy pursued in this regard can be elucidated as follows.", "Concerted efforts are underway to expand the reach of formal finance in view of recent emphasis on financial inclusion.", "This needs to be buttressed with financial education to generate greater customer awareness and understanding of financial products and services.", "Concurrently, a process of credit counselling is being encouraged to help all borrowers, but particularly those in distress to overcome current financial problems and gain access to the structured financial system.", "The Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) has also been instituted which is expected to ensure that the banks formulate and adhere to their own comprehensive code of conduct for minimum standards of banking services, which individual customers can legitimately expect.", "And finally, a Banking Ombudsman Scheme has been instituted for redressal of grievances against deficient banking services, covering all the States and Union Territories.", "The RBI has also been exploring the possibility of instituting a Depositor Protection Fund (DPF).", "The Fund can be utilised towards generating greater awareness for the common man on issues relating to financial education and counselling.", "This could be complemented with providing greater role to our Regional Offices to promote financial education in their respective jurisdictions.", "The international co-operation of the kind which OECD and PFRDA have embarked upon is a welcome development.", "I would like to congratulate them for undertaking this useful initiative and thank them for giving me an opportunity to be a part of this process.", "I have no doubt that this Conference will prove to be an important milestone in the area of financial education for our country.", "We, at the RBI, too look forward to benefiting from the deliberations."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
