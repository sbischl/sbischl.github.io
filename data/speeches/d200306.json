of decision making.", "Studies suggest that a higher female presence in top management could help develop better types of leadership behaviour across organisations - namely people development, setting

regulation, as central bankers, many of our decisions on monetary policy and on financial stability are made by people with a background in economics.", "And we know that perspectives differ by

need to fill data gaps but also to reflect on how data is used in policy design.", "That having more diverse planners, decision makers and policymakers should lead to a world better designed to reflect our population.", "So how can we get to a place with diverse boards and decision makers, where policy is both designed and challenged in its very design by diverse policymakers, to the very

levels of regulated firms and we have committed to publishing this data on an annual basis.", "We were the first regulator to publish data on fitness and probity applications with a diversity lens.",

corporate governance code to have diversity policies.", "We are trying to nudge behaviour towards a new improved norm, by being very clear on what we expect to see in such policies.", "When we started to collect the data in 2012, the results were poor, where only one in six applications were for female candidates.", "In our latest report for 2019, which will be published in the coming days the number is 26% or over one in four applicants, and a two percentage point increase since 2018.", "Underneath the small increase, there are substantial differences in role holders across sectors.", "For

or imbalance in the type of roles that women apply for.", "The data continues to show a pronounced gender imbalance at board level and in revenue generating roles as opposed to second line of defence roles.", "For example, female applicants for head of investment roles stands at 13% whereas female applicants for compliance and risk roles stands at 41%.", "And while we are seeing some progress, there is still a long way to go.", "We are placing a spotlight on this issue and intend to keep it there.", "In 2018, as part of a major piece of supervisory work on the mortgage market, the Central Bank also published a report on the 'Behaviour and Culture of the Irish Retails Banks,' in which we also conducted diversity and inclusion assessments.", "And next month we will publish the findings of a diversity and inclusion thematic assessment of the insurance industry along with best practice guidance for the wider industry.", "It is worth recalling why we, central banks and regulators are doing this.", "We want to ensure boards have a wide diversity of views.", "We also consider that lack of diversity is a leading indicator of elevated behaviour and culture risks.", "Of course diversity goes beyond gender, but it is also within gender, diversity of experiences, diversity of thought, diversity of perspectives.", "We want the firms we supervise to make good decisions, take considered risks and not succumb to groupthink.", "The firms we supervise now expect challenge from Central Bank supervisors when there is a lack of diversity at board and management levels.", "Beyond

Ireland's Strategic Plan 2019-2021.", "Thinking back to when I joined the Central Bank in 1996, the Bank had no women on the senior management team and not a single female head of division.", "Today, our senior leadership committee is made up of 40% women, and 46% of our heads of division are female and our overall staff is gender balanced.", "We have diverse views around the table when we are making policy decisions, reducing groupthink and increasing challenge and debate.", "There have been many contributing factors to this.", "In recent years, the Central Bank established a diversity and

economics for example.", "A recent initiative in the United Kingdom #discovereconomics is aiming to change perceptions of economics and what economists really do, with a goal to increase diversity in economics students.", "In Ireland we are considering these approaches also, talking to universities and other public sector bodies that employ economics graduates, considering how we can promote the study of economics to a wider group of students, a more diverse group that reflects our population.", "I myself did not have dreams of being a leader the day I joined the Central Bank.", "I didn't see women in the leadership roles.", "As leaders both male and female, we need to encourage our staff and colleagues to make the jump, to reach for the promotion, to stretch ourselves.", "This is a similar point made in this year's OMFIF report by my colleague, Deputy Governor Delgado from the Banca de Espana.", "She advises young women to seize opportunities.", "As policymakers we need to encourage participation, challenge and debate.", "As regulators we need to challenge firms we supervise to ensure diversity and its benefits are on the agenda.", "As employers we need to create a culture that values difference.", "We need to think about people starting out in work, going for promotion, returning from maternity leave, changing career paths or future leaders.", "But of course, let's never forget that behind all the numbers, the indexes, the data, are individual women and girls each with their own story.", "2018, \"The performance effects of gender diversity on bank
