national importance and are critical to the development of the economy, to evolve national policies and priorities relating to the statistical system and to evolve standard statistical concepts, definitions, classifications and methodologies in different areas in statistics and lay down national quality standards on core statistics.", "One of the key recommendations of this Commission was to establish a permanent National Commission on Statistics to serve as a nodal and empowered body for all core statistical activities of the country, evolve, monitor and enforce statistical priorities and standards and to ensure statistical co-ordination among the different agencies involved.", "In line with the above recommendations, the Government of India ordered the setting up of a permanent National Statistical Commission (NSC) on 1st June 2005.", "The present setup of NSC is a type of umbrella organization covering both CSO and NSSO.", "National statistical system and the role of the Reserve Bank Reserve Bank of India (RBI) collects and analyses statistics on various economic transactions of banking and other financial institutions in the process of implementing its policies towards achieving its implicit twin objectives of growth and price stability.", "A major part of the statistics in RBI is collected through either statutory or control returns, which are exclusively used for monetary policy and supervision.", "In the field of information generation and analysis we adhere to international standards and practices.", "To collect supplementary statistics, RBI conducts surveys in the fields of credit to rural/urban households, industrial outlook, inflation expectations, different aspects of banking sector, external sector and the private corporate sector.", "In addition to the abovementioned surveys, recently RBI has initiated steps to make use of survey methods for various operational purposes, e.g., to assess the extent of success and realities of implementation of financial inclusion.", "You may be aware that in India, Government as well as the central bank attach enormous importance towards financial empowerment of the rural poor and RBI has taken steps for financial inclusion and spread of Self Help Groups.", "In support of monetary policy, we propose to introduce survey of professional forecasters, as done in most of the central banks in developed countries.", "In addition, it may be necessary to collect necessary information for compiling housing starts, in view of the increasing importance of housing construction in the economy.", "However, in view of the current state of data availability with local authorities, this will need considerable additional work before any significant progress can be made.", "Other Central Banks conduct a number of other surveys, both ad hoc and regular ones, in order to help more informed monetary policy meeting, and other needs as they arise.", "As we improve the technical basis of our monetary policy apparatus we will need to keep innovating in this area.", "Traditionally RBI is directly involved in national accounts compilation, especially in savings estimation and flow of fund compilation.", "Basic information on household and corporate savings is provided to CSO for preparing the final estimates.", "Besides, data on output of banking system in GDP is imputed from the data supplied by us.", "RBI also has a long tradition of conducting important surveys in collaboration of NSSO.", "The first comprehensive survey conducted by RBI is known as All-India Rural Credit Survey, with 1951-52 as the reference period.", "The objective of the survey was to collect such data/information as would assist the RBI and the Government of India in formulating an integrated credit policy for rural credit and to assess the extent of indebtedness of rural households to financial institutions in the organized and unorganized sectors.", "Findings of this landmark survey subsequently changed the entire landscape of Indian banking and culminated in introducing the world's biggest social banking experiments in the form of rural credit and priority sector lending.", "Such All-India surveys were conducted decennially and the latest survey pertained to the year 2002-03.", "While the 1951-52 and 1961-62 surveys covered only rural households, the subsequent surveys covered urban households also.", "The surveys of 1971-72 and 1981-82 were conducted jointly with NSSO, Government of India, whereas those of 1991-92 onwards were conducted entirely by NSSO.", "The other area, which has direct consequence with RBI activities, relates to measurement of output and price.", "As member of the Technical Advisory Committee of National Accounts Statistics (NAS), Statistics on Prices and Cost of Living (SPCL), revision of WPI and CPI series, etc., RBI has been playing a critical role.", "Let me highlight a few recent initiatives.", "The procedure of converting current price estimate into constant price followed earlier, especially for estimating the output of financial sector, resulted in some kind of anomalies.", "In some cases, while estimate at current price was negative, constant price estimate was positive and increasing.", "However, in the last GDP revision (1999-00 series), this problem was corrected after a series academic discussion with CSO.", "Similarly, treatment of some of the financial intermediaries like mutual funds was not defined clearly in SNA 1993.", "And treating mutual funds similar to banks was conceptually not correct.", "Recently, CSO set up a committee in RBI to look into this matter and the recommendations of the committee has been accepted by TAC of NAS.", "Besides, RBI is also working in close collaboration with CSO for implementing the ensuing changes of SNA revision due this year.", "Let me cite an example of RBI's recent involvement in price measurement issues.", "The need for integration CPIs is nothing new.", "The National Statistical Commission (2001) recommended, inter alia, that the current CPIs do not provide changes in the prices for the entire rural and urban population since they are designed to measure the changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by specific segments of the population and hence there is a need to compile the CPI separately for the entire rural and urban population.", "In this context, a Sub-Group set-up in RBI, recommended the compilation of separate CPIs for whole rural and urban population and provided a roadmap for compilation.", "I happy to note that TAC on SPCL has finally accepted this and shortly we shall have CPI(U) and CPI(R).", "Needless to mention that these price indices will be very useful for monetary policy purposes.", "Application of statistical methods in RBI: need for further work Before I conclude, let me outline a few areas of work in RBI where statisticians can contribute significantly.", "First, as monetary policy formulation largely depends on the forward-looking behaviour of the economy, the use of forecasting techniques automatically comes in the forefront.", "While traditional time series techniques are useful, we need to build up expertise on forecasting using calibrated models.", "Such models have definitive advantage of incorporating economic agents utility, requires less data and can be maneuvered easily with different alternatives.", "Second, RBI incurs a huge expenditure on management of currency through out the country.", "Operations research techniques could be utilized effectively in the areas of inventory, transportation, etc., so as to develop an efficient and cost effective currency management systems.", "Third, risk analysis under a statistical framework is a pre-requisite for implementing Basel II norms.", "Fourth, innovative sample surveys in the area of financial inclusion, development of leading indicators like house-start index, inflation expectation, etc., could be very useful tools.", "Fifth, we do not have an appropriate measure of potential output.", "It is not an easy task; however, efforts should be made to devise a suitable methodology for estimating potential output at the earliest.", "Finally, let me conclude by saying that knowledge building is an ongoing activity.", "Frontiers are shifting upwards consistently and thus demanding a persistent catching up with the advanced knowledge.", "Central banking today is more challenging than ever and accurate information is the key to supplement policy decisions.", "I hope the Statistics Day and the conference on financial statistics pave the platform of knowledge sharing and understanding of advanced frontiers."], "classifications": ["none",
