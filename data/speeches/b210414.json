\u20ac15 billion, to \u20ac122 billion, increasing by almost 50 per cent compared with ten years ago.", "In line with Eurosystem accounting rules, this appreciation is recorded in the revaluation account on the liability side and does not contribute to the Bank's net profit.", "Investment assets other than those held for monetary policy purposes rose by \u20ac8 billion, to \u20ac148 billion; of these, 86 per cent are public sector securities, 10 per cent are equity and investment fund shares, and the remaining 4 per cent consist of other financial assets.", "Investment criteria that take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) best practices, which were introduced in 2019 for the management of equity portfolios, were extended to other types of financial instruments.",

with the provisions laid down in the EU Treaties.", "Moreover, by recognizing the importance of providing the market with adequate information on environmental risks and on the activities that affect the climate, the Eurosystem's central banks are promoting the production and dissemination of reliable data and of statistical and accounting standards that are as suitable and homogenous as possible at global level.", "On the liability side, the deposits of credit institutions almost tripled, from \u20ac102 billion to \u20ac299 billion, owing above all to the sizeable liquidity provided by the Eurosystem through monetary policy operations and to its more homogeneous distribution among euro-area countries.", "After widening substantially between March and June, at a time of turbulence on the financial markets, the Bank of Italy's negative balance on the TARGET2 European payment system partly recovered in the final months of 2020, ending the year at \u20ac516 billion, for a total increase of \u20ac77 billion.", "The improvement reflected the recovery of capital flows to Italy and the disbursement of the first instalments of loans to the Italian public sector from the European

higher amount entered in the Treasury payments account.", "Profitability, risks and organizational measures Future developments regarding the Bank's balance sheet, as well as its profitability, will continue to be influenced by those in monetary policy measures and by the overall state of the economy.", "The gross profit for 2020, before taxes and transfers to the general risk provision, was equal to \u20ac10.2 billion, lower by \u20ac0.6 billion compared with 2019.", "The main contributors to the profit were: net interest income of \u20ac8.5 billion; the net result of the pooling of the Eurosystem's monetary income, amounting to \u20ac1.8 billion; realized gains of \u20ac1.3 billion; and income from equity shares and participating interests of \u20ac0.6 billion.", "Operating expenses and write-downs brought the total down by \u20ac1.9 billion and \u20ac0.2 billion, respectively.", "The decrease compared with 2019 is attributable to a reduction of approximately \u20ac1 billion in net interest income owing to the increase in interest expense on refinancing operations and the decline in yields on securities denominated in euros and in foreign currency; this was partially offset by higher interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes, driven by the exceptional increase in such holdings.", "Realized gains rose by \u20ac0.4 billion, owing mainly to the disposal of equity and investment fund shares in the course of rebalancing the Bank's investment portfolio.", "Transfers to the provision for general risks amounted to \u20ac2.5 billion, \u20ac1.0 billion more than in 2019.", "The allocation is consistent with the objective of progressively strengthening the financial buffers against the significant growth in the size of the Bank's balance sheet and in its overall risk exposure, ascribable mainly to monetary policy assets.", "Taxes, amounting to \u20ac1.4 billion, increased compared with 2019, when they stood at just over \u20ac1 billion.", "Operating expenses remained largely stable.", "Excluding charitable donations, operating expense fell by a total of around 4 per cent owing to the decrease in staff costs, mainly due to the decline in severance payments during the year, and in costs associated with the physical presence of staff in the workplace such as, for example, business trips and utilities.", "In 2020, the Bank's staff, numbering 6,671 at the close of the year, worked an average of almost 60 per cent of working days remotely (compared with 4 per cent in 2019); the percentage rises to over 90 per cent when considering only the period between mid-March and the end of April.", "The Bank's IT infrastructure and equipment and its organizational and flexible governance arrangements, and the staff's dedication and ability to adapt to the new working conditions made it possible for the Bank to respond quickly to the challenges posed by the pandemic.", "The Bank was always able to ensure the delivery of essential services to the public, whilst maintaining its high level of quality.", "The public was encouraged to use online channels to access information services, such as data contained in the Central Credit Register and the Interbank Register of Bad Cheques and Payment Cards.", "Activities that require the physical presence of staff in the workplace, mainly banknote production and distribution as well as collection and payment services on behalf of the State, were adapted to ensure they can be carried out safely, thereby guaranteeing business continuity.", "The experience acquired over the course of the emergency has laid the groundwork for defining a new 'hybrid' model of work organization in which physical presence in the workplace must be integrated with remote working.", "We are hard at work on this task.", "As regards organizational arrangements, the reform initiated to consolidate supervision on the conduct of banking and financial intermediaries, strengthen customer protection tools and increase financial education levels for the public was implemented, and a new directorate general dedicated specifically to these tasks was established.", "Furthermore, the tasks relating to monetary circulation and those regarding retail payment instruments have been integrated into a single directorate general, with an emphasis on technological developments.", "To support the financial system's adoption of digital technologies and foster their safe use for financial stability purposes, the Bank of Italy has launched Milano Hub, its new innovation centre.", "The features of the Eurosystem's payment systems were improved during the year.", "In this respect, the Bank acts as sole service provider for the development and management of the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) platform.", "The platform, which offers an innovative and safe solution for the instant settlement of retail payments, is able to increase the speed of not just payments between individuals and firms, but also those with government bodies.", "As usual, further information on the activities of the Bank and on the organizational and management measures implemented in 2020 will be available in the Report on Operations and Activities of the Bank of Italy, to be published in May, on the occasion of the presentation of the Annual Report.", "More information on the Bank's commitment to the issue of environmental sustainability may be found in the yearly Environment Report, available on the Bank's website.", "Proposal for the allocation of the net profit Dear Shareholders, Pursuant to Article 38 of the Statute, acting on a proposal of the Governing Board and after hearing the opinion of the Board of Auditors, I present for your approval the Board of Directors' proposal for the allocation of the net profit.", "On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Governing Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Board of Auditors for their diligent and accurate work.", "Under the dividend policy in force, the amount paid to the Shareholders is kept within a range of \u20ac340 million to \u20ac380 million, provided that the net profit is sufficient and without prejudice to the Bank's capital adequacy.", "The difference between the upper limit of the range and the dividend paid to the shareholders may be allocated to the special item for stabilizing dividends, until this item reaches a maximum amount of \u20ac450 million.", "Accordingly, from the net profit of \u20ac6,286 million, we propose allocating \u20ac340 million as a dividend to the shareholders, the same amount allocated in each of the last six years and equal to 4.5 per cent of the capital.", "Therefore, we propose allocating \u20ac40 million to the special item for stabilizing dividends, which would then amount to \u20ac200 million.", "Pursuant to the Statute, shares exceeding the 3 per cent threshold are not entitled to a dividend.", "Therefore, the dividend actually due to the Shareholders would amount to \u20ac273 million.", "The dividend corresponding to the shares exceeding the threshold, equal to \u20ac67 million, would be allocated to the ordinary reserve.", "As a result, the remaining profit for the State would be equal to \u20ac5,906 million which, in addition to taxes for the year amounting to \u20ac1,409 million, would bring the total amount allocated to the State to around \u20ac7,315 million.", "The total amount allocated to the State over the last five years would therefore reach \u20ac25 billion, in addition to taxes amounting to \u20ac6.5 billion."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
