Government meeting in 2007, which discussed the subject of poverty eradication through human capital development.", "The purpose of the Financial Inclusion Advisers programme was to provide

progressive and inclusive financial system.", "The strategies implemented have generated six characteristics of the financial system.", "First, a business environment that allows a diverse range of financial service providers to thrive and compete.", "This environment has led to the creation of commercial financial institutions with differentiated strategies based on their strengths and the
