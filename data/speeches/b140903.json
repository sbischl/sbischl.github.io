Japan's economic activity and prices 1.", "Economic activity Now I will discuss Japan's economic activity and prices.", "The Bank's current assessment is that Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, although the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike has been observed.", "Looking at developments in private consumption since April 2014, despite the decline I just mentioned, many firms have indicated that the degree of the decline has been broadly in line with expectations.", "In terms of sentiment, the consumer confidence index, which had been relatively weak for some time, has improved for two consecutive months.", "Yet a wide range of indicators should continue to be monitored closely, as the adjustments in some aspects of housing starts and of automobile sales may be somewhat prolonged, and a decline in real wages could gradually affect consumption as a whole.", "As for business fixed investment, some indicators of machinery investment showed a decline following the substantial increase in the January-March quarter of 2014, but business fixed investment plans are strong in the June Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) - released at the beginning of July - suggesting that firms are maintaining a positive attitude.", "Business fixed investment is therefore likely to continue on a moderate increasing trend.", "Exports have been leveling off more or less, with a continued lack of momentum.", "This is largely attributed to the negative growth rate of the U.S. economy in the January-March quarter and the sluggishness in emerging economies - including ASEAN economies with strong ties to Japan's economy.", "However, it is likely that structural factors have also been at work, such as the shift of Japanese firms' production sites to overseas accompanying their increased local procurement.", "The GDP growth rate for the April-June quarter, which is scheduled to be released in August, is likely to register a considerable negative figure due to the effects of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the tax hike.", "However, the Bank considers that a virtuous cycle of the economy has been operating firmly, together with a clear improvement in the employment and income situation, and therefore Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend.", "Prices With regard to prices, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, or the so-called core CPI, was 1.3 percent for June, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike.", "The rate of increase has recently been hovering at around 11\u20444 percent, with the waning of upward pressure from energy-related prices generally offsetting the effects of price rises in other items.", "Outlook for economic activity and prices In terms of the outlook for Japan's economy, exports are expected to increase moderately while domestic demand is likely to maintain firmness.", "In this situation, a virtuous cycle among production, income, and spending is likely to be maintained.", "Therefore, the economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend, and the effects of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike are expected to wane gradually.", "The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be around 11\u20444 percent for some time, and follow a rising trend again from the second half of fiscal 2014.", "The Bank compiles and releases the Policy Board members' forecasts for economic activity and prices on a quarterly basis.", "Looking at the medians of the members' forecasts released in July, the real GDP growth rate is projected to be 1.0 percent for fiscal 2014, 1.5 percent for fiscal 2015, and 1.3 percent for fiscal 2016.", "Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential rate, which is assumed to be around 0.5 percent.", "The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is projected to be 1.3 percent for fiscal 2014, 1.9 percent for fiscal 2015, and 2.1 percent for fiscal 2016.", "The Bank judges that it is likely to reach around 2 percent -

a price index that reflects actual household consumption expenditures and is used to deflate such figures as wages.", "The year-on-year rate of increase for June 2014 was 4.4 percent, more than 1 percentage point above the core index, which is behind the recent substantial decline in real wages.", "As for recent developments, the rate of increase -

mainly advanced economies - recovers.", "On the other hand, structural factors, such as the shift of Japanese firms' production sites to overseas, are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on exports.", "Moreover, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the past depreciation of the yen will boost export volume.", "In the medium to long term, it is hoped that Japanese firms will make progress in developing and supplying new high-value-added products, which in turn will lead exports.", "For the time being, however, I am paying attention to whether exports will turn to a moderate increase mainly against the background of the recovery in overseas economies.", "The bank's monetary policy A.

The bank's price stability target Under the monetary policy I have described, the Bank considers that Japan's economy has been following the path toward achieving the 2 percent price stability target.", "Recently, questions have often been asked regarding the criteria and approaches for judging whether the price stability target is achieved and whether the target is maintained in a stable manner.", "I would like to take this opportunity to offer some thoughts on this matter.", "As the Bank announced when it introduced the price stability target in January 2013, the target has been set in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI.", "With regard to the CPI, the CPI for all items is naturally of prime importance as a price index that comprehensively covers goods and services consumed by households and to which the general public is accustomed.", "On the other hand, looking at the CPI for all items alone could lead to a misjudgment of the underlying trend of inflation, because this CPI includes items that temporarily show large fluctuations, such as fresh food.", "In this regard, the CPI for all items less fresh food, or the core CPI, is considered to be the most useful index to identify the trend of the CPI for all items.", "The Bank in fact uses the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI when referring to the forecasts of prices presented in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, in which it outlines its thinking on the future conduct of monetary policy.", "Other indices that demonstrate the underlying fluctuations in the CPI include the CPI (all items less food and energy) and the CPI (10 percent trimmed mean).", "These indices aim at identifying the underlying fluctuations in the overall CPI by excluding certain items.", "At the same time, however, they eliminate a certain proportion of items consumed by households, and thus differ somewhat from price indices that comprehensively reflect the structure of household consumption.", "For example, food expenditures in Japan account for a larger proportion of household consumption expenditures than in other countries; the CPI (all items less food and energy) of Japan covers 68 percent of the total items, which is nearly 10 percentage points below the 77 percent coverage in the United States.", "In terms of the effects on economic activity, it is also necessary to monitor developments in the CPI (all items less imputed rent), which - as I mentioned earlier - reflects household consumption expenditures and is used to deflate such figures as wages.", "As illustrated, each price index is not necessarily perfect for grasping the underlying trend of the overall CPI or the effects on economic activity.", "I think you would agree that it is not appropriate to judge whether the price stability target is achieved solely by examining the core CPI, for example.", "In my view, the achievement of the price stability target should always be judged comprehensively by examining the CPI for all items, the core CPI, and other pricerelated indicators to identify changes in the underlying trend of the overall CPI.", "The same basically holds true for judging whether the target is maintained in a stable manner.", "There are no quantitative criteria or specific indicators to assess such conditions.", "Whether the target is maintained in a stable manner should be judged comprehensively by closely monitoring developments in a wide range of price-related indicators and sufficiently examining and assessing the current situation and the outlook for economic activity and prices.", "Toward the sustainable growth of Japan's economy Thus far, I have talked about the Bank's monetary policy.", "Japan's economy has been following a path toward overcoming deflation.", "In this situation, a trend in which the output gap is positive (representing excess demand) - has begun to take root, albeit with some fluctuations due to the consumption tax hike.", "This trend is seen in the tightening of labor supply and demand conditions.", "Given that slack in the economy has shrunk, as widely recognized, it has become increasingly necessary to strengthen supply capacity in order for Japan's economy to raise its growth potential in the medium to long term.", "An economy's growth potential, from a relatively longer-term perspective, depends on the growth in capital stock and labor input, as well as improvements in productivity through innovation and the like.", "This indicates that it is private economic entities that play the most important role in efforts to strengthen growth potential and pursue the growth strategy.", "At the same time, to strengthen growth potential, it is essential to build an environment that enables private economic entities to unleash their creativity and \"animal spirits\" by (1) increasing the labor participation of women and the elderly, (2) eliminating restrictions to market entry, and (3) carrying out regulatory and institutional reforms.", "In promoting such an environment from a macroeconomic perspective, the government plays a critical role.", "In June 2014, the Cabinet decided the new Japan Revitalization Strategy and Basic Policies, which aim to revitalize Japan's economy.", "I strongly expect that efforts based on these measures will proceed steadily."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Economic activity", "Prices", "Japan's economy", "Monetary policy", "Price stability target", "Inflation", "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE)", "Loan Support Program", "Growth potential", "Structural reforms"]}
