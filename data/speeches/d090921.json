with below-target inflation and a considerably negative output gap - might, under criteria 1 and 2, indicate in isolation that the interest rate should be set very low and even be negative towards the end of 2009.", "This is illustrated by the green line.", "However, the Executive Board chose to take a less drastic course of action on the basis of the other criteria taken into consideration.", "Criterion 3 states that previous methods of operation should be taken into account and that the interest rate should normally only be changed gradually.", "With emphasis on interest rate smoothing in the loss function (i.e.", "criteria 1+2+3), the result is the black line.", "This interest rate path is still low, and lower than the path that was in fact chosen.", "Criterion 4 states that monetary policy should be robust and criterion 5 that cross-checking should be carried out.", "In a turbulent economic situation, we were uncertain whether our model was the right one for the Norwegian economy and wanted to guard against model misspecifications.", "In an economy where unemployment is around 3 per cent and inflation is on target, setting the interest rate as low as zero was regarded as going too far.", "A practical approach to model uncertainty is to cross-check using simple monetary policy rules such as the Taylor rule (criterion 5).", "In addition to the basic Taylor rule, we usually employ a variation of this rule involving external interest rates, and a rule where the output gap is replaced by GDP growth.", "A mechanical application of the Taylor rule would have resulted in a forecast approximately as indicated by the blue line in the diagram, i.e.", "considerably higher than the interest rate path that was chosen.", "A higher interest rate path would also have resulted in more negative output and inflation gaps.", "Achieving the inflation target would have taken ten years.", "An interval for the interest rate is determined based on the criteria, where optimal policy (with interest rate smoothing) defines the lower boundary and the Taylor rule yields the upper boundary.", "After an overall assessment, the interest rate forecast indicated by the red line was selected.", "The interest rate decision, in Norway as elsewhere, is based on discussion by a board.", "Criteria 3, 4 and 5 introduce conditions that cannot easily be observed.", "We have to apply judgement.", "The criteria contribute to consistency and structure the discussion.", "The Riksbank also applies judgement when selecting the interest rate path.", "But Svensson does not discuss possible shortcomings in the macroeconomic model.", "In Chart 10, he shows how the various interest rate paths, differing by around 1\u20442 percentage point in the period to summer, could result in differences in the inflation rate of close to 4 percentage points as early as next autumn.", "Monetary policy seems to be having a very strong impact.", "It would be interesting to hear whether he thinks that relying so heavily on such a model in interest rate setting is robust, and how possible errors in the model should be guarded against.", "We also know from experience that market participants' perceptions can differ from ours, particularly somewhat further ahead.", "There can be a variety of reasons for these differences and Svensson discusses a number of them.", "It would also be useful to study the volatility surrounding publication of key macroeconomic variables.", "We would prefer to see lower volatility around monetary policy meetings, and that any surprises are postponed to a time closer to the publication of new macroeconomic data.", "Solberg Johansen (2008) - winner of the Bertil Ohlin prize for best thesis in international economics at the Stockholm School of Economics - examines volatility in the yield curve.", "Her findings provide some support for a decrease in volatility around monetary policy meetings, but no strong evidence to suggest that financial market volatility around the publication of new data has changed after Norges Bank began to publish interest rate forecasts.", "Another study that might provide useful input is Ehrmann and Fratzscher's (2007) analysis of developments in US market rates in the period between monetary policy meetings under two different communication regimes.", "I will close by concurring with Blinder and colleagues (2008) when they write that: \"... the publication of projected paths for the central bank's policy rate appears to be the \"new frontier\" in central bank communication.", "But it has been practised in so few countries for so few years that we have little empirical knowledge of its effects as yet.", "As more data accumulates, this should be a high-priority area for future research.\"", "It is reassuring to know that the economist that has begun this important work is Lars Svensson.", "Blinder, Alan S., Michael Ehrman, Marcel Fratzscher, Jacob De Haan and David-Jan Jansen (2008): \"Central Bank Communication and Monetary Policy: A Survey of Theory and Evidence\", Journal of Economic Literature 46, 910-945.", "Ehrmann, Michael and Marcel Fratzscher (2007): \"Social Value of Public Information -
