Having shed the status of being a protectorate of Great Britain upon obtaining independence in 1968, Swaziland could have refashioned its orientation in a number of ways; including at one extreme complete isolation (pure self reliance) or, at the other extreme, incorporation into a larger unit and management by some authority other than Britain.", "The nature of the problem, I argued ... is to find that institutional framework within which to maximise national, social welfare... subject to the constraints which are imposed by the decisions which all other countries have made: for it is these decisions which define the universe within which choice must be exercised.", "I also asserted that, ... for a small, emergent economy with limited bargaining power, the option of refashioning the global economy in order to maximize national welfare does not exist, whereas such an option does exists for the large, mature economies which created the Bretton Woods institutions and the post-war economic order.", "Although this was stated in the previous century, I believe it to be true still.", "In the event, the authorities have made choices: most importantly, in this regard, by

Treaty and the Constitutive Act of the African Union.", "In the main, this involves a single monetary area, encompassing a common currency and a common central bank by the year 2021.", "In terms of the AMCP monetary union in Africa is to be achieved in six stages starting in 2002/2003 and culminating in stage VI in 2021 with the introduction and circulation of the common African currency.", "During these six stages, African governments and central banks will have to work towards harmonisation and coordination of macroeconomic and monetary policies, the harmonising of interconnected payment and clearing systems, the strengthening and harmonisation of banking and financial supervision and the observance of increasingly strict macroeconomic convergence criteria.", ".1 The African Monetary Cooperation Programme (AMCP) Stated in point form, the stages of the programme are as follows: Stage I (Year 2002-2003) - Establishment of Sub-regional Committees of the AACB where they do

adjustments have been made, and the current statement of the programme envisages completion by 2015: not 2021 as in the original thinking.", ".2 The SADC region Within the SADC region, the movement towards monetary integration and eventual union is guided by the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) which has pledged support for the AMCP.", "The CCBG was established in 1995 with the specific purpose of achieving closer cooperation and integration in the area of monetary policy among SADC central banks.", "The work of the CCBG has contributed to major developments towards regional monetary cooperation such as significant progress in the harmonisation of the payment and clearing systems, the approval of Memoranda of Understanding on Cooperation, Coordination of Exchange Control Policies in SADC, and Cooperation in the area of Information and Communication Technology.", "The CCBG has also contributed to the coordination of training for central bank officials in SADC and the

and Swaziland participates in them all.", "The questions which policy makers will have to continue to address are clear.", "Should we continue down this path?", "Do the programmes have realistic time frames?", "Fortunately, I don't have to wrestle with them: and any assessment by me would be not only discourteous but also presumptious.", "I have sketched the issues in broad outline, and thank you
