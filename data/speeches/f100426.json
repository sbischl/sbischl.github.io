banking, microfinance, and telecommunication sectors, as well as donors and government agencies, setting the stage for a creative and fruitful working session.", "There are about 4 billion unbanked people1 in the world, which is more than twothirds of the population of low and middle-income countries.", "In Pakistan, the ratio of financial exclusion is even higher.", "In spite of the

financial systems which provide low income and marginalized communities with increased access to viable financial services, thus allowing them to become a critical component in, and contribute to, the country's economic development.", "Alternative delivery channels 3.", "Traditionally, the provision of financial services to the low income population is often based on personal, one-to-one relationships, making it human resource intensive.", "Thus, financial institutions have to incur high costs for building and maintaining branch networks and developing trained personnel.", "Alternative delivery channels can reduce these costs and offer a balance between personalized services and emerging transactional services, such as mobile banking.", "Research conducted by the CGAP Technology Program in 2008 found that using third-party agents costs on average 30 times less globally and 76 times less in Pakistan and replacing them with a mobile phone further cuts costs in half.", "The most common of these delivery channels include mobile phones, third party agents, and use of PoS terminals.", "In addition to significant cost reduction, alternative delivery channels expand outreach to areas in which the traditional bricks and mortar approach is unfeasible, and also increases product diversification by making savings and remittance products convenient, efficient and profitable.", "On the client side, such delivery channels provide unprecedented convenience through remote payments.", "Here, I would like to mention that SBP is facilitating the microfinance sector in rationalizing current high cost structures.", "GoP has granted certain tax incentives to the sector.", "We expect that NADRA would also favorably consider its fee structure for clients'

country through a network of more than 10,000 agents for account opening, handling of deposits and withdrawals into the customer's virtual \"wallet,\" and customer support services.", "These agents can take cash from customers and credit it to their mobile account, and transfer money to other registered users.", "M-PESA has significantly reduced many of the spatial and temporal barriers to money

Banking - Pakistan 9.", "Ladies & Gentlemen, now let us look at Pakistan.", "Our financial sector is going through a dynamic transition, led by increasing uptake of technology solutions.", "This transition can be seen in recent e-banking data, with a transactional volume of 46.4 million e-payments valuing Rs.", "4.1 trillion during a single quarter of October-December 2009.", "These volumes are expected to grow substantially as Pakistan has currently 95 million mobile users compared to 26 million bank accounts, highlighting the inherent potential for mobile banking in Pakistan.", "Pakistan is the first country in South-Asia to have issued Branchless Banking Regulations, providing commercial and microfinance banks a supportive regulatory environment for developing partnerships and innovative delivery channels.", "Our regulations support the bank-led model, in which the entire control & responsibility of the product and program rests with the authorized financial institution.", "Due to inherent risks and existing legal framework, the telco-led model has not been permitted at the moment.", "These actions were reinforced by the Ministry of Information Technology and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which issued policy directives to provide technical support for the implementation of Branchless Banking in Pakistan.", "With an enabling regulatory structure

of Pakistan Post.", "The second model is \"Retailers\" acting as MFB's agents.", "In October 2009, Telenor and Tameer launched the largest Branchless Banking initiative in Pakistan, Easy Paisa.", "This allows individuals to use services such as utility bills payment, domestic remittances, and a deposit account (M-wallet) by visiting their nearest EasyPaisa authorized shop, Telenor Franchise,
