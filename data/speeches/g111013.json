it is what you know for sure that just ain't so!\"", "As is invariably the case with any major crisis, the global financial crisis has unleashed a passionate debate over the design of a new global financial and regulatory architecture.", "However, the trouble has been not so much with the existing, inter-temporally evolved, global financial regulatory architecture as really with how it was actually worked in practice.", "Huge losses at global banks running to about USD 2 trillion were not because existing best practices, risk management and internal controls failed but because those responsible for implementing, and enforcing them, failed them!", "From 1990s to 2011 and from Nick Leeson of Baring Brothers to Hamanaka of Sumitomo Corporation to Kerviel of Societe Generale to Adoboli of UBS AG, the underlying story has remained just the same!", "After all, of all risks to regulators and regulatees alike, human resources risk is by far the most serious as it is the source of all risks as confirmed by the recent financial cataclysm.", "The crux of the matter is what we need is not more or less regulation and governance but good regulation and governance which simply means actually doing what must be done!", "This has been the undoing of both regulators/supervisors and financial firms/banks alike.", "In the way of example, in the USA, the traditionally very healthy AAA rated AIG and mono-line bond insurers MBIA and Ambac changed their business model from insuring only their staple products and strayed into insuring CDOs and ABS and writing CDS.", "While this went unnoticed by insurance regulators, Pershing Square, a hedge fund, spotted trouble and started shorting both equity and credit risk of these two companies.", "But even after this, regulators failed to take notice and corrective action with the two companies being eventually downgraded several notches and AIG having to be bailed out by the Fed and US government.", "The same is true of financial firms and banks where independent directors on the boards, much less ask right questions, apparently didn't even understand the arcane world of modern finance and banking and according to a column in the Financial Times, after the crisis, one leading global bank ran an advertisement inviting applications for board positions from experienced professional bankers!", "Besides, rather than take timely notice of, and act on, early warning signals coming from financial markets, like stock and CDSs markets, regulators chose instead to shut themselves to these early warning signals themselves by banning short selling which act effectively amounted to shooting the messenger for the unpalatable message it had to convey!", "Another development that portends build-up of systemic risk is a rather rapid growth of ETFs with USD 1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) which has close parallels, in terms of complexity and opacity, with the CDO market, including its \"squared\" and \"cubed\" variants.", "Financial Stability Board and Financial Services Authority have already raised concerns what with emergence of synthetic ETFs, inverse, or short, ETFs and leveraged ETFs.", "In particular, there are concerns with synthetic ETFs which depend upon a swap with parent bank to track return of an index against collaterals which considerably deviate from the index being tracked.", "This gives rise to the possibility that banks may be using ETFs to finance their riskier and illiquid assets cheaply than they would be able to do in a standard repo market.", "The synthetic ETFs also introduce counter-party risk not present in plain vanilla ETFs.", "However, that leaves out the non-ETF financialized commodities as a significant component of the total global financial assets worth US $ 242 trillion (banking assets: $ 104 trillion, equity: US $ 47 trillion and bonds: US $ 91 trillion), of which there is no estimate in the Global Financial Stability Report of IMF;
