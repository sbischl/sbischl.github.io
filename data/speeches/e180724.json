continued pursuit of professional growth and excellence in the banking system.", "Last year, BAIPHIL's theme was \"Scaling New Heights in Banking Excellence.\"", "I recall making reference to Mt.", "Everest with the qualification that in the banking industry, the heights we scale are not static - they are ever changing.", "Indeed, this is the reality we face.", "Among other shifts, continuing advancements in digital technology are redefining the way we do things.", "Technological developments account for a growing demand for new and more sophisticated financial products and for faster and almost near real-time, same-day service delivery.", "I find it encouraging that again, the BSP and BAIPHIL are on the same page.", "Your theme, \"Fostering Stewardship amidst Financial Innovations\", runs parallel to our own 25th Anniversary theme, \"Navigating the Future,\" with focus on traversing the digital frontier and the evertransforming economic and financial landscape.", "Stewardship with Changes Less Obvious But before I dive into the topic of digital change - a change that is evident to many - allow me to share my views on an area that is also fast-changing, but with changes perhaps less obvious, because we are very focused on the head winds.", "This is the area of monetary policy design and how market-based approaches must be developed and adopted to skillfully conduct it.", "For me, it is a matter of urgency given the necessity to stay relevant and ahead of the times.", "Now, more than ever, I find it compelling to talk about how the BSP has always been, and remains to

before the end of my term, five years from now.", "Do not look at this in isolation.", "Instead, may I urge you to allow deeper analysis.", "It is easy to say that the RR cuts result in injecting

RRR cuts are not without compensating action as the IRC framework is in place to absorb excess liquidity.", "As such it is intended to be policy neutral operational adjustment.", "In fact, the liquidity releasing impact of the two previous RR cuts that we've done so far this year, is actually less than the liquidity draining impact of open market operations and our significant FX operations to manage excessive peso volatility in the face of external uncertainties.", "This has resulted in tighter financial conditions as evidenced by rising market interest rates.", "We will continue to rely on changes in the policy rate as our key signalling mechanism of our intended monetary stance.", "Rest assured, the BSP is focused on managing overall domestic liquidity as influenced by multiple factors through effective open market operations.", "We are, in this area of less obvious but real changes, exercising stewardship, never losing our focus.", "Stewardship in the Digital Age Coming to

innovation.", "Others call this the \"regulatory sandbox\".", "Essentially, we provide a testing ground for new business models to guide us in assessing potential risks.", "The ultimate objective is to be aware of the risks, to employ mitigating actions as needed, but also to allow room for market players to leverage on these new technologies.", "Guided by this approach, the BSP ensures that the intensity and content of supervision is calibrated according to the magnitude of risks identified in a new activity.", "We believe that this is the only way that we can allow innovation to happen.",

fintech players.", "To date, we have already approved a project under the test-and-learn approach that will facilitate the creation of a real-time domestic and overseas remittance corridor without the need to establish a central operator.", "This will be beneficial to remittance businesses which rely heavily on correspondent banking for the safe and efficient settlement of remittance transactions particularly inflows from Overseas Filipinos to their family beneficiaries.", "There is also an on-going project, probably many of you know about, it being spearheaded by the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) to develop digital identification (IDs) powered by a block chain technology.", "The BAP has partnered with a technology and consulting company and with several domestic banks to employ a \"self-sovereign\" type of identity management, granting customers full control and management in the sharing of personal and sensitive information.", "Amidst all these digital transformations and financial innovations, the BSP also recognizes the fundamental need to create a secure, reliable and efficient digital financial ecosystem where all these innovations can come
