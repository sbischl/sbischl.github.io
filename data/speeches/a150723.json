and particularly women - save enough to ensure them a proper income after retirement.", "Another way to look at the demographic change is to examine what is happening to the relationship between the working-age population and the retirement-age population.", "We can see that the trend in Israel is similar to the trend in other countries, although with somewhat of a lag.", "As of today, there are five working-age people in Israel for every person above age 65.", "This change obviously has serious consequences for the labor market, the dependency ratio, and as a direct result, the actuarial state of National Insurance and the old pension funds.", "An international comparison of retirement arrangements shows that in Israel, the retirement age for women is relatively low, and even after it rises to 64, as it is supposed to do in 2017, it will still be significantly lower than in most European countries, some of which are also in the midst of gradually raising it, and all of which except for Switzerland have set out that the retirement ages for men and women will become equal in the future.", "Like in Israel, these countries also have wage gaps between men and women.", "The retirement age for men in Israel rose to 67, and is similar to the retirement age among European countries that have already raised the retirement age to the upper benchmark.", "The large gap between men and women in Israel is prominent, and it raises a question regarding women's ability to save sufficiently for retirement.", "The longer a decision to raise the retirement age for women further is delayed, the more necessary it will be later on to do so more rapidly, and with greater problems.", "The effect of the trends on the replacement ratio: In view of the trends I have so far presented, a most interesting question arises: What will happen to the level of pension payments at retirement?", "The variable that we customarily look at in this context is the replacement rate -
