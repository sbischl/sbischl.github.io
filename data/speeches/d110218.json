cent.", "When the fiscal rule was introduced in 2001, it was emphasised that some of the additional fiscal leeway provided by the oil revenues would be used to strengthen the long-term growth potential of the Norwegian economy, for example by investing in infrastructure, research and education.", "The authorities have used the fiscal leeway to implement standard increases and raise spending in a number of areas.", "On the other hand, the priority given to measures aimed at boosting productivity and hence the long-term growth potential, including adjustments to the tax system, seems to have receded somewhat into the background.", "The main objective of fiscal policy is to secure the provision of good public services, ensure an appropriate distribution of income and invest in major infrastructure.", "This objective must apply in good times as well as bad.", "At the same time, all desirable spending programmes must be prioritised within an overall budget framework.",

increased purchasing power when property is offered for sale.", "This increases risk in the financial system.", "The high level of borrowing, particularly among US households, was an important factor contributing to the financial crisis in autumn 2008.", "Although debt growth has slowed in Norway, the level of debt shows no sign of falling.", "While monetary policy and fiscal policy have been anchored within a long-term, operational framework over the past ten years, there has been no comparable, coherent regulatory system for financial markets.", "Requirements are currently imposed on individual banks, but without adequate regard to overall risk in the financial system.", "The financial crisis highlighted the need to strengthen the current framework.", "In the event of shocks to the economic system, the authorities have a role as lender of last resort.", "This also has a side effect - banks may feel at liberty to take on excessive risk.", "The banks keep the profits in good time, while they expect the public to foot a share of the bill in the event of failure.", "Regulation of the financial sector must therefore secure financial stability, but at the same time protect the public against losses.", "Akerlof, Spence and Stiglitz - the 2001 Nobel Prize laureates - described how market participants adapt their behaviour and provided important background for the

sound operational framework that protects society against losses.", "This is now on the agenda in Norway and in other countries.", "I would like to highlight three main aspects of this work: First, the financial crisis revealed that banks held insufficient capital, excessive short-term market funding and inadequate liquidity buffers.", "The new Basel III framework sets out stricter requirements.", "Higher and better-quality capital will increase banks' resilience to pronounced fluctuations in the economy without their having to tighten lending abruptly.", "The new rules aim to moderate growth in banking in periods of expansion.", "Second, the new framework includes macroprudential tools that can be applied as necessary.", "Banks may be subject to additional capital requirements if credit growth in the wider economy is excessive.", "The requirement is intended to ensure that banks build up an extra capital buffer when systemic risk increases.", "Loan-to-value ceilings on mortgage loans may also be imposed.", "Third, the authorities must acquire tools that enable banks to be wound up in an orderly manner.", "In this context, it is important that the structure of banking groups is transparent.", "Banks must also draw up plans for their own liquidation in the event of difficulties.", "Owners and creditors - not taxpayers - must bear the losses.", "The interest rate on banks' funding will then reflect the risk they take rather than an implicit government guarantee.", "This will in itself have a preventive effect.", "In some areas, banking sector regulation in Norway has been stricter than in other countries.", "Over time, this has been a strength, not a weakness, for Norwegian banks.", "The new international rules are to be phased in

demanding to restrain debt growth in times of strong optimism and confidence in the future.", "Our experience of well defined mandates and a clear delegation of responsibility in the field of monetary policy has been positive.", "The legal authority to implement macroprudential measures to safeguard financial stability should be delegated, just as the government has delegated responsibility for

towards the regulatory optimism that I described earlier?", "The picture is probably more nuanced.", "The banks have shown a striking ability to adapt, a skill which they hardly intend to relinquish.", "It must be acknowledged that no regulation can prevent financial institutions from encountering difficulties.", "A new regulatory framework must therefore ensure that banks have the ultimate responsibility for the risk undertaken.", "Regulatory compliance will then also be in their own interest.", "In my address this evening, I have sought to gather together some historical
