policy management -primarily well-tailored, consistence, and prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix-, which should be underpinned by a well implemented structural reforms.", "We are convinced that with maintaining reform momentum would shore up public confidence and create investment-friendly environment.", "Apart from that, it would allow the country to diversify economic growth away from its reliance on natural resources, in a better position to withstand against global shock, and ultimately to sustain its economic growth in the longer term.", "We applaud the government bold steps and
