low inflation and weak in periods of especially high inflation.", "Inflation poisons the economy.", "The interest rate affects inflation through a number of channels.", "An increase in the interest

the opposite effect.", "The strength of these effects will depend on the situation prevailing at the time of the interest rate change and how the change is perceived.", "The effects may also vary over time.", "Monetary policy affects the economy with a lag.", "Analyses carried out by Norges Bank indicate that a substantial share of the effects on inflation occurs within two years.", "Two years is

and continued large surpluses on the current account and in government finances.", "The krone exchange rate, measured against our most important trading partners, has appreciated by about 7 per cent since the spring of 2000.", "However, the krone exchange rate is about 2.5 per cent weaker than in 1990 and at the same level as in the mid-1990s.", "Traditional merchandise exports remained high in

will stimulate activity because petroleum revenues will now be phased into the economy.", "According to the Government's estimate, the guidelines imply an average increase in the use of petroleum revenues in the central government budget of about 0.4 per cent of mainland GDP each year from 2002 to 2010.", "The government budget that was approved for 2002 implies that the use of petroleum revenues will increase by 0.6 per cent of mainland GDP from 2001 to 2002.", "The guidelines for fiscal policy imply a substantial stimulus each year.", "The expansionary impetus varies considerably, and is greatest in the first few years.", "However, an unpredictable and more expansionary fiscal policy than that implied by the guidelines would have resulted in greater uncertainty.", "The guidelines provide a stable framework that contributes to reducing some of the uncertainty.", "Over time, the size of the internationally exposed sector will be affected by the portion of petroleum revenues that is absorbed by the Norwegian economy but will be unaffected by monetary policy.", "Any appreciation of the krone may, nevertheless, affect the speed at which changes occur in the business sector.", "To maintain a balance in the Norwegian economy, the phasing in of petroleum revenues must be countered by a monetary policy stance that is tighter than it would otherwise have been.", "This may be accomplished through a higher interest rate, an appreciation of the krone, or both.", "On balance, we expect moderate growth in the mainland economy in the next two years.", "The

"Low international growth and lower petroleum investment are curbing employment growth.", "A tight labour market is generating continued high growth in labour costs.", "An expansionary fiscal policy, growth in private consumption and a continued high rise in labour costs contribute to a high rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services.", "At the same time, we expect a temporary decline in prices for imported consumer goods.", "This reflects lower international commodity and producer prices, a slower increase in global consumer prices and a stronger krone exchange rate.", "As these effects wane, and if global economic growth picks up in line with expectations, import price inflation may reach a more normal level.", "If growth in the global economy picks up again as we have assumed, we expect consumer price inflation to be about 21\u20442 per cent in two years.", "Meanwhile, consumer price inflation may be somewhat lower due to the downturn abroad and the decline in prices for imported goods.", "Norges Bank presented its most recent Inflation Report in October 2001.", "In the light of international developments, and other factors, we considered the probability that inflation two years ahead would be lower than 21\u20442 per cent to be greater than the probability that it would be higher.", "This was the basis for Norges Bank's decision to reduce its key rate by 0.5 percentage point to 6.5 per cent in December.", "Norges Bank's assessment of the outlook for inflation remained unchanged following the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting on 23 January this year."], "classifications": ["fiscal dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary
