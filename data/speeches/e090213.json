sponsors and speakers for supporting this important gathering.", "This year's theme for the Forum - \"Growth Opportunities Beyond the Crisis\" - is a reminder that the financial landscape has changed dramatically since the last time this Forum was held.", "The turning point in the global financial crisis is generally agreed to have been the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in the middle of September last year.", "This turned a problem that had been seen as primarily affecting the developed markets into a worldwide phenomenon.", "Previously the slowdown was expected to be limited to the developed markets while the emerging markets continued their recent strong growth.", "After Lehman the slowdown began to affect all parts of the global economy.", "The crisis has been a stark reminder of how interconnected the world financial system and economy has become.", "Financial sectors have also become more interconnected.", "While most comment has concentrated on the role that the Lehman bankruptcy played in worsening the crisis, we should not forget that the events surrounding AIG also had an impact on global financial markets.", "In other words, AIG had become systemically important and had far reaching implications outside the insurance industry.", "At the Central Bank of Bahrain, we believe that the recent experience of global financial crisis has

market.", "Through the years, we have established an excellent relationship with the insurance market and this has helped tremendously as we solicit key information and feedback.", "This feedback has allowed us to ensure that our rules are kept up to date and flexible enough to deal with the dynamic nature of the insurance industry.", "To strengthen the insurance market, we need to have an ongoing dialogue with insurance firms and we do so on a regular basis through prudential meetings as well as by working closely with various components of the insurance infrastructure such as the Bahrain Insurance Association (the BIA) and the Insurance Learning Center of the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance (the BIBF).", "Bahrain has also played a key role in the MENA region by hosting the GAIF conference last year and now having assumed its presidency for the next term.", "Since the introduction of our new regulatory framework in 2005, we have gradually implemented our rules and continue to believe that while our model abides with the best international standards as promulgated by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, it must also recognise the unique characteristics of our region.", "As an example, this is why we have taken the lead in tailoring our framework for the Takaful and retakaful markets.", "We believe that insurance firms should have proper public disclosures that reflect their true financial positions.", "The disclosure of an appropriate level of technical and mathematical reserves must be in line with international actuarial standards.", "To reinforce our belief in the added value of using actuarial expertise, we are requiring all companies licensed by the CBB to produce on a regular basis a detailed actuarial report, outlining the basis of the liabilities appearing on companies' balance sheet.", "These reports are reviewed and in some instances subject to further scrutiny should we believe that there may be a tendency to understate claims liabilities or to ignore the need to set up premium deficiencies where products are being priced well below profitable rates to \"squeeze out\" the competition.", "These tactics may have short term benefits but when the claims start exceeding the premiums and significant loss ratios emerge, insurers will be faced with decreasing profit margins and significant losses.", "At the same time, however, responsibility for ensuring the soundness of the industry does not only fall on regulators.", "It is also a vital responsibility of those running insurance businesses.", "The lessons of the global crisis will necessitate a clear direction from company management and the need to adapt and revamp business strategies if companies wish to pursue growth

to a tightening of reinsurance rates, a business aspect that is crucial in the smooth functioning of an insurance market.", "The current status of reinsurance capacity in our region needs to be scrutinized and companies must adapt new strategies based on their current assessment of the reinsurance markets.", "Second, as insurance providers, companies receive funds from policyholders up front and must make important investment decisions to ensure that liquidity needs are met when called upon by policyholders.", "The current investment climate has been plagued with much uncertainty with many \"sure\" investments having disappeared from the financial landscape.", "Who could have imagined that Lehman Brothers would no longer be an active member of the financial industry?", "Companies therefore need to revamp their investment strategy to cope with these changes.", "Third, we need to be reminded of the importance of having in place a good corporate governance regime.", "Corporate governance is a key component in ensuring the overall soundness of all companies, including insurance firms.", "The valuation of shares as well as public disclosure and transparency are highly dependent on management's approach to a sound framework of corporate governance.", "While it is sometimes tempting for those in the industry to view regulation as a burdensome imposition from outside, the financial crisis has been a reminder that markets need effective regulation if they are to operate properly.", "As a regulator, we at the CBB believe in creating a climate that encourages the development of a strong and sound insurance sector.", "In Bahrain, we have welcomed several new companies over the last few years, a testimony to the belief that we offer an environment where
