a challenge as well as an opportunity Currently, the most important factor shaping the world is globalisation.", "The benefits of globalisation have been well documented and are being increasingly recognised.", "Integration of domestic markets with international financial markets has been facilitated by tremendous advancement in information and communications technology.", "But, such an environment has also meant that a problem in one country can sometimes adversely impact one or more countries instantaneously, even if they are fundamentally strong.", "There is a growing realisation that the ability of countries to conduct business across national borders and the ability to cope with the possible downside risks would depend, inter alia, on the soundness of the financial system.", "This has consequently meant the adoption of a strong and transparent, prudential, regulatory, supervisory, technological and institutional framework in the financial sector on par with international best practices.", "All this necessitates a transformation: a transformation in the mindset, a transformation in the business processes and finally, a transformation in knowledge management.", "This process is not a one shot affair; it needs to be appropriately phased in the least disruptive manner.", "High capital inflows: not an unmixed blessing As you all know, liquidity position in the financial sector has been quite comfortable in the recent times.", "The buoyant capital market coupled with an appreciating rupee vis-a\u0300-vis US dollar has been attracting large foreign institutional inflows during the last two years.", "While we have an all time high foreign exchange reserves of more than $140 billion, high capital inflows pose a big challenge to monetary and exchange rate management.", "In this context, operationalisation of Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has given an additional instrument for liquidity and monetary management.", "To sum up the challenge, I would like to quote a statement of Dr. Y. V.

one relates to capital and the other to market discipline.", "Where capital is concerned, the prescriptions have ushered in a transition from the traditional regulatory and market measures of capital adequacy to an evaluation of whether a bank has found the most efficient use of its capital to support its new business mix, i.e., from capital adequacy to capital efficiency.", "In this transition, how effectively capital is used will determine returns on equity and a consequent enhancement of shareholder value.", "In effect, future plans may, therefore, include the fluid use of capital, an approach that has been called the \"just-in-time balance sheet\" management, in which capital flows quickly to its most efficient use.", "This transition in how capital is used and how much capital is needed will become a significant factor in return-on-equity strategy for years ahead and banks' strategic plans may be required to execute this kind of approach.", "The accord also has, as an underlying principle, the reliance on the market to assess the riskiness of banks.", "This translates into an increased focus on transparency and market disclosure, critical information describing the risk profile, capital structure and capital adequacy.", "Besides making banks more accountable and responsive to better-informed investors, these processes enable banks to strike the right balance between risks and rewards and to improve the access to markets.", "Improvements in market discipline also call for greater coordination between banks and regulators.", "India has been a participant in the international initiatives to ensure improved processes of market discipline that are being worked out in several fora, such as, the multilateral organisations, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, and the Core Principles Liaison Group.", "Concurrent efforts are underway to refine and upgrade financial information monitoring and flow, data dissemination and data warehousing.", "Banks are currently required to disclose in their balance sheets information on maturity profiles of assets and liabilities, lending to sensitive sectors, movements in NPAs, besides providing information on capital, provisions, shareholdings of the government, value of investments in India and abroad, and other operating and profitability indicators.", "Financial institutions are also required to meet these disclosure norms.", "Banks also have to disclose their total investments made in equity shares, units of mutual funds, bonds and debentures, and aggregate advances against shares in their notes to balance sheets.", "The critical regulatory initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank of India to prepare the banking sector for these changes are : (i) the Reserve Bank's endeavour to ensure that the banks have suitable risk management framework oriented towards their requirements dictated by the size and complexity of business, risk philosophy, market perceptions and the expected level of capital; (ii) The introduction of Risk Based Supervision (RBS) in 23 banks on a pilot basis; (iii) the drive to encourage banks to formalize their capital adequacy assessment process (CAAP) in alignment with their business plan and performance budgeting system; (iv) Ensuring better disclosure so as to have greater transparency in the financial position and risk profile of banks and (v) finally, the Reserve Bank at its end is in the process of building capacity to ensure it can vet models for banks who will be adopting the IRB / Advanced Measurement approaches.", "As banks have two years lead-time to prepare themselves for Basel II, they are encouraged to focus on capacity building and undertake impact analyses.", "On the basis of the impact studies, banks would be required to put in place appropriate strategies and plans for raising fresh capital or augment capital through internal resources.", "Banks may also need to redefine their business strategy with a view to altering their profile of risk exposures or adopt a combination of both these approaches to meet the capital requirement.", "Organizations all over are rushing to implement the latest ideas on management, sometimes to the point of overuse.", "Most of these ideas are about doing things better, about improving operational effectiveness.", "If everybody however is competing on the same set of variables, then the standard gets higher but no one gets ahead.", "And getting ahead -
