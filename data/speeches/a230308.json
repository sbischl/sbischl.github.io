{"sentences": ["SPEECH Underlying inflation Lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Trinity College Dublin Dublin, 6 March 2023 When inflation has been far from target for a sustained period and the process of monetary tightening has been under way for some time, there are three primary inputs into monetary policy decisions.", "[ First, in view of the medium-term orientation of monetary policy, the inflation forecast over the next one to three years plays an important role.", "Second, the incoming information on underlying inflation constitutes an essential additional basis for assessing medium-term inflation dynamics, in view of the conditional nature, the lower frequency of production and the intrinsic uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic forecasts.", "[ Third, especially in view of the transmission lags from shifts in the monetary policy stance to the financial system, the economy and inflation dynamics, assessing the incoming information on the transmission of previous monetary policy decisions is also necessary for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy decisions.", "[ My focus today is on the second input: underlying inflation.", "The assessment of underlying inflation (which should be understood in a broad sense, including the information contained in wage dynamics and inflation expectations) should be viewed as a complementary cross-check to the inflation forecasting process.", "In one direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time support the narrative embedded in the inflation forecast, this boosts confidence levels (among policymakers, market participants, firms and households) in the inflation forecasts.", "In the other direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time are at odds with the inflation forecast, this calls for robust policy decisions that take into account the different signals coming from the forecast and the analysis of underlying inflation.", "[ My plan for this lecture is as follows.", "First, I will discuss the conceptual issues involved in analysing underlying inflation.", "Second, I will review the recent data flows that are relevant for assessing underlying inflation in the euro area.", "Third, I will offer some concluding remarks on the role of underlying inflation in the setting of monetary policy over the coming months.", "Underlying inflation: conceptual issues Ehrmann et al.", "(2018) summarise the basis for examining measures of underlying inflation as follows: \"The central bank faces the problem of distinguishing in real time the \"signal\" on medium-term inflationary pressure contained in the HICP inflation data from the \"noise\" stemming from temporary or idiosyncratic factors.", "To this end, measures of underlying inflation are routinely monitored.", "Generally, their purpose is to obtain an estimate of where headline inflation will settle in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished.\"", "In view of the major dislocations of recent years (the pandemic, the energy shock, the war), it is helpful to think of headline inflation as currently being driven by three factors: (a) pure noise; (b) a reverting component; and (c) underlying inflation.", "In particular, the economics of dislocations suggest that there is currently a substantial reverting component of inflation that is sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that can also be expected to fade out over the near term.", "Examples of the reverting component include: the passthrough of energy and food cost shocks to other sectors; the impact of bottlenecks; and pandemic re-opening effects by which there are temporary mismatches between demand and supply in contact-intensive sectors.", "These factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation since the middle of 2021 and, even if there has been some easing or even a reversal in these factors, the adjustment process to these shocks is still ongoing and is not likely to come to a sudden stop.", "While the adjustment process may also affect medium-term inflation dynamics, the quantitative contribution to inflation is plausibly larger over the near term than over the medium term.", "Since the peak impact of monetary policy is further out than one year, this reverting component of inflation should be less important for monetary policy than the mediumterm underlying component.", "Since the standard measures of underlying inflation typically make a two-level distinction between the transitory and persistent components of inflation, these standard measures should not be taken at face value under conditions in which the slowly-reverting component might be (at least partly) mis-classified as contributing to medium-term inflation dynamics.", "It follows that the interpretation of the standard measures require additional analysis under current conditions to take into account the potential role of the reverting component.", "Before turning to the analysis of the range of indicators of underlying inflation, it is also necessary to recognise that the trajectory of the underlying inflation component can be affected by shocks to the noise and reverting components of inflation.", "First, even a pure noise shock can have a permanent effect on the price level if a positive inflation shock is not followed by a subsequent negative inflation shock.", "This holds even more strongly for a shock to the reverting component: since a sustained period of high inflation can leave a large footprint on the price level if it is not fully reversed.", "In turn, a surprise permanent increase in the price level can trigger medium-term inflation dynamics through its impact on the subsequent path for nominal wages, as some unwinding of the initial decline in real wages can be expected and the wage adjustment process can play out over an extended period.", "[ Second, especially if there is a backwardslooking component in how firms, households and financial market participants form beliefs, a period of high inflation can persistently alter inflation expectations, with a direct and substantial impact on mediumterm inflation expectations.", "Again, this risk is more substantial in relation to the reverting component than the pure noise component of inflation.", "For these reasons, actual inflation outcomes and measures of inflation expectations belong in the family of indicators that are relevant in assessing the underlying inflation pressures.", "In one direction, strong increases in headline inflation or an upward above-target revision in inflation expectations would reinforce upward pressure on underlying inflation; in the other direction, a material decline in headline inflation or an easing in above-target inflation expectations should alleviate upward pressure on underlying inflation.", "Underlying Inflation: indicators and analytics Inflation increased very quickly since the middle of 2021 (Chart 1).", "While the peak was at 10.6 per cent in October, inflation has remained at a high level, with the February reading still at 8.5 per cent.", "Comparing headline inflation to the various standard indicators of underlying inflation, Chart 1 also shows that the decline in inflation has been primarily due to the easing of some temporary inflation pressures, most notably the remarkable decline in gas prices in recent months.", "[ Chart 1 also shows that various forecasts (including the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections) project a substantial decline in inflation later in 2023 that extends into 2024 and 2025.", "The gap between standard measures of underlying inflation and these forecasts poses significant interpretative challenges for policymakers.", "Indicators of underlying inflation and inflation projections and expectations (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.", "The latest observations are for February 2023 (flash) for HICP and HICPX and January 2023 for the rest of underlying inflation measures.", "The latest observations for market-based indicators of inflation compensation are for 2 March 2023.", "The SPF data show expected annual percentage changes one-year and two-years ahead of latest available (i.e.", "The Survey of Monetary Analysts and the December 2022 Broad Macroeconomic Projection exercise (BMPE) by Eurosystem staff show quarterly forecasts.", "The cut-off date for data included in the ECB staff macroeconomic projections was 30 November.", "As shown in Chart 1, the ECB tracks several indicators of underlying inflation.", "Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages: monitoring a range of indicators helps to guard from any specific approach being affected by idiosyncratic factors and model uncertainty.", "[ The most prominent standard indicator of underlying inflation is core inflation defined as the HICP excluding energy and food (HICPX), which stands at 5.6 per cent in the February data.", "The latest available (January) estimates show that the other underlying inflation indicators range between 4.1 per cent (Persistent and Common Component of Inflation - PCCI - excluding energy) and 8.1 per cent (the 10 per cent trimmed mean).", "While the PCCI measures have eased in recent months, most other indicators do not show signs of a turnaround.", "[ In overall terms, the range is not only elevated but also wide, indicating that there is a high level of uncertainty about underlying inflation.", "In trying to gain further understanding about underlying inflation dynamics, it is worthwhile to examine momentum in inflation dynamics.", "While the typical focus is on an annual frequency (the price level today compared to the price level one year ago), this necessarily implies some inertia in inflation measurement, given the high overlap on a month-to-month basis in annual inflation calculations.", "At the same time, switching focus to a much higher frequency (such as month-to-month inflation data) runs the risk of increasing the noise-to-signal ratio in view of the role of seasonal and idiosyncratic factors in the monthly data.", "An intermediate option is to examine as momentum indicators the 3 month on 3 month seasonallyadjusted inflation data (annualised for comparability purposes).", "Chart 2 shows the momentum indicators for the main HICP categories.", "[ While there has been a clear turnaround in energy inflation and there are some signs of deceleration for food inflation, momentum for core inflation has not declined.", "In particular, momentum in the goods category remains strong.", "The momentum indicator for services inflation requires a nuanced interpretation.", "The basic series suggests an easing of services inflation since November.", "An alternative series (the dashed line) that excludes the impact of the cheap travel ticket scheme in Germany last summer indicates that services inflation started easing in August but with a partial reversal in February, which came in at 0.1 percentage points above the January reading.", "[ Indeed, this alternative series may better capture the severe pressure on services prices during the intense phase of pandemic reopening in the spring and summer of 2022 that was partly offset at the time by measures such as the German travel ticket scheme.", "In any event, these differential momentum patterns reinforce the importance of taking a granular approach to understanding inflation dynamics, since the relative contributions of the noise, reverting and underlying components may vary across categories.", "Moreover, in relation to core inflation, the goods and services categories are shaped by quite different forces, such that it is important to take due account of the individual trajectories of goods inflation and services inflation.", "[ Inflation momentum (annual percentage changes; annualised percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat.", "Notes: Momentum is defined as annualised 3 months on 3 months rates, seasonally adjusted data.", "HICPX: HICP excluding energy and food.", "The corrected momentum series on the right panel excludes the effects of the 9 euro ticket in Germany.", "Latest observation: February 2023 (flash).", "In trying to assess the potential contribution of a reverting component to inflation dynamics, one basic question to ask is whether the recent declines in energy prices should also contribute to lower food inflation and core inflation in the coming months (over and above the operation of base effects by which earlier price increases drop out of the inflation calculation).", "There are two potential channels.", "First, energy constitutes a significant cost component for many sectors.", "During the phase of intense energy price increases, these put upward pressure on costs and prices in other sectors over the last eighteen months.", "While the impact on pricing decisions of cost declines may not be fully symmetric to the impact of cost increases, some passthrough should be expected.", "Second, the decline in headline inflation means that the increase in the cost of living (the overall price level) is now lower than expected in the December staff projections.", "In turn, all else equal, less upward pressure on the cost of living should mean a lower path for nominal wages (albeit playing out over an extended period), which is a central factor in the determination of underlying inflation.", "To assess passthrough from energy to core inflation (the first channel), it is helpful to look at the dynamic correlations between these two components.", "Chart 3 shows that there were typically negative correlations between energy inflation and core inflation in the first decade of the euro (possibly reflecting the endogenous reaction of monetary policy to headline inflation).", "[ However, positive contemporaneous correlations were observed more frequently after the financial crisis.", "This could indicate that the speed of the pass-through from energy to core inflation has increased since the financial crisis.", "[ Over the last eighteen months, the correlation of energy and core inflation has become increasingly contemporaneous - reflecting that energy has passed through very quickly to core inflation and been an important factor in the recent increase in core inflation in the euro area.", "This could imply that the recent decline in energy prices could also be reflected much more quickly than usual in core inflation in the euro area.", "Correlation of HICP energy

market, hiring wages are likely to outpace the wages offered to existing workers such that the level of the wage growth tracker is not necessarily an indicator of the expected future level of aggregate growth in negotiated wages.", "Rather, it is more likely to serve as a leading indicator of the momentum in wage dynamics.", "For instance, the earlier pickup in this wage tracker since
