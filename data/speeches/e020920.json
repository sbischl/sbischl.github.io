temporary slowdown.", "With respect to domestic demand, public investment is projected to follow a declining trend and private consumption is likely to remain weak for some time due to the severe employment and income situation.", "Leading indicators suggest that business fixed investment will stop declining, but a distinct recovery in the immediate future is unlikely partly due to large uncertainty regarding overseas economies.", "Nevertheless, if the uptrend in exports and production continues, corporate profits will stay on a track to recovery, and this will gradually have a positive impact on domestic private demand.", "Overall, it can be envisaged that the stabilization of Japan's economy will gradually become definite as overseas economies continue the moderate recovery.", "However, it will take a while for the economy to show clear signs of recovery, as the pace of increase in exports and production is expected to slow temporarily while restraining forces

commodity prices including crude oil have recently risen.", "Domestic wholesale prices have weakened, reflecting the decrease in import prices to date.", "Moreover, consumer prices remain on a gradual downtrend and corporate services prices continue to decline.", "As for the conditions surrounding price developments, the balance between supply and demand is expected to keep exerting downward pressure on prices for a while amid persistently weak domestic demand, although the completion of inventory adjustment and the rise in capacity utilization rates will support prices to some degree.", "Moreover, factors such as the ongoing technological innovations in machinery, deregulation, and the streamlining of distribution channels will continue to restrain prices.", "Under these circumstances, domestic wholesale prices are projected to continue to be weak for a while.", "Consumer prices are expected to stay on a declining trend for the time being at the current gradual pace.", "While the slower growth in imports of consumer goods is expected to alleviate the downward pressure on prices to some extent, the faster pace of decline in wages may possibly reinforce the
