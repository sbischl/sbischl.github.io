up during periods of rising interest rates or in times of uncertainty.", "While the market for 'special repo' facilitates borrowing of securities, it is worthwhile to consider other alternatives that ensure adequate supply of securities to the market across the spectrum of maturities.", "It may be recalled that discussions were held on the introduction of Securities Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (SLBM) with a view to augment secondary market liquidity, by incentivizing 'buy and hold' type of investors (e.g., insurance companies, pension funds) to make available their securities to other market participants.", "Useful feedback was received on the subject from the FIMMDA and the PDAI.", "I would urge that these discussions be carried forward with a view to evolving market-based
