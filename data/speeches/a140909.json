BMAP as the industry association deserve recognition for contributing to the growth of our banking system.", "And indeed, the industry has sustained its growth trend.", "What is most telling is how much we have become stronger even during the recent period of global financial difficulties.", "The difference is even more pronounced with loans outstanding: it grew 7.6% a year between 2001 and 2008

"Instead, I would like to highlight how risk management, good corporate governance and consumer protection can and have made a real difference in ensuring the stability of our banking system.", "It is this stability that underpins our banks' value proposition to savers, while providing a viable counterparty for borrowers.", "The value of risk management cannot be overstated.", "In a market where uncertainty and risks are hallmark issues, a bank can only be viable as a two-way agent between savers and borrowers if it is able to effectively manage its risk exposures.", "This certainly matters to depositors who rely on banks to keep their savings safe.", "Products you offer may have bells and whistles; but in the end, they are only as good as your promise to make the underlying funds available when depositors need them.", "It matters as well to your borrowers.", "Your ability to keep the bank operating in a safe and sound manner allows them to build a lasting relationship that

requirements, with capital ratios that are comfortably above the regulatory minimum.\"", "Nevertheless, as gratifying as these external views may be, the challenge is still to maintain our strengths and address weaknesses that have been identified.", "Risk management may provide the technical on- and off-book expertise but this has to be complemented by a strong and unwavering culture of corporate governance.", "To different entities corporate governance can mean several things; but for banks it may simply boil down to mitigating conflicts of interest.", "There are conflicts because savers entrust their savings to the banks while banks must deploy these funds productively.", "In the end, it is the bank's corporate governance culture that will protect the public's savings from excessive and unwarranted risk-taking.", "We accept that banking is a business where products are designed and marketed to the public.", "But banking is more than just marketing and sales.", "Its power lies in the information that banks possess.", "Thus, the crux of the business is, in fact, protecting the integrity of the pre-sale process and a solid commitment to after-sale support.", "Banking is a promise to and a relationship with stakeholders.", "This is built by instilling confidence that the bank is operating prudently.", "If the business of banking is to be a going concern,

risk management and a commitment to a corporate culture of governance lead us to the third aspect of the Philippine banking brand: that of empowering the financial consumer.", "This is an area which does not need much further elaboration before an audience like BMAP.", "Last year, for instance, you launched the revised \"Banking Code for Consumer Protection\" which reflects your own commitment to our financial consumers.", "This should be taken in parallel with the \"Consumer Protection Framework\" which the Monetary Board recently approved.", "Together, these two initiatives suggest that we do not pay lip service to consumer protection.", "Instead, we now have live frameworks that institutionalize market conduct standards, strengthen the redress mechanism, cultivate financial literacy as an active element of financial well-being and hold stakeholders accountable for their behaviour.", "The bar is set deliberately high but I know we are all fully committed.", "Moving forward, the BSP will sustain its collaboration with the industry in crafting policies that raise the bar for banking excellence.", "We shall pursue this through an environment that enables the development of a

BMAP's \"Kiddie Account Program.\"", "I understand that around 526,000 kiddie savings accounts have been opened as of March 2014.", "I am happy that more children are developing the habit of saving but the challenge is to promote the program to more areas and to reach out to more children.", "I hope BMAP will continue to push this program forward with greater vigor.", "If you recall, we received the country award in 2013 from the Amsterdam-based Child and Youth Finance International or CYFI for having the best financial education program for children that combines curriculum integration of lessons on saving and money management with actual bank campaigns to encourage children to save in banks.", "If you recall, BMAP members from BDO, BPI and RCBC Savings briefed foreign delegates from CYFI on their respective marketing campaigns under the Kiddie Account Program.", "This has made such a positive impression that CYFI considers our integrated program an international best practice model.", "We therefore share this award with the Department of Education and BMAP.", "Financial education that leads to responsible personal finance management is now considered a life skill everyone must have, like reading and writing.", "Ultimately, everyone handles money, whatever station in life one has.", "I hope therefore that BMAP will employ its creativity and ability to reach out to millions of financially unserved Filipinos who represent a big untapped market.", "We are happy that BMAP has initiated its own Bank Marketing Awards for best practices in brand and product marketing in the industry.", "This is aligned with our objective of creating a distinct brand for the industry - a brand marked by both competence and excellence.", "Certainly, these efforts can go a long way in making our banking industry truly responsive to the needs of our people.", "Ladies and gentlemen, much has been gained by and in Philippine banking.", "From a marketing perspective, it may be beneficial if banks integrate their individual marketing plans into an industry marketing approach for branding purposes.", "For instance, if Philippine tourism has \"It's more fun in the Philippines\" tagline, the banking sector may also consider developing a program that embodies its collective aspirations.", "Competence and excellence founded on effective risk management, an unwavering corporate culture of good governance and the empowerment of the financial consumer.", "These are the essential brand elements we see of the Philippine banking system.", "I have no doubt that BMAP can harness your collective expertise to make this happen and to boost the overall competitiveness of the Philippine banking industry.", "I believe this is a challenge worthy of BMAP - an association that has 40 years of track record behind it.", "With the liberalization of the entry of foreign banks to the Philippines and the forthcoming ASEAN Integration, developing a distinct brand for Philippine banking is a goal worth pursuing.", "If BMAP is successful in developing this as a legacy, the next generations of bank marketing professionals can look back and celebrate this milestone as the game changer that raised the quality of bank marketing in the Philippines.", "I know BMAP is up to this challenge.", "It is said that life begins at 40.", "This is the perfect time therefore to start on this legacy project.", "And to add more context and perspective to BMAP's 40th anniversary, I wish to share that this year, I am celebrating my 40th year - I am not referring to my birthday and certainly not to my waistline.", "This year, I mark my 40th year as a central banker.", "Ladies and gentlemen of BMAP.", "To me, this is a sign that good things will continue to develop as we continue our partnership.", "A partnership for a stronger, more responsive, and more responsible banking system that promotes sustained and inclusive growth.", "Together, let us work on this legacy.", "Finally, I thank BMAP for its continuing support to the BSP's programs.", "Again, my congratulations to BMAP as well as its leaders and members, past and present.", "Mabuhay ang ating
