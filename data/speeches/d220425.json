with less-skilled workers experiencing lower wage growth than those with higher education levels - and the reduction in bargaining power for workers.", "Inequality is something that central banks need to pay close attention to, not least because it does have economic consequences as well as implications for social capital and the public's trust in a state's institution Monetary policy decisions inevitably affect nancial markets, and the wider economy.", "This is why central banks must have a clear mandate, which in the case of the euro area is of course price stability.", "We also conduct proportionality assessments, which include analysis on the benets and the possible side effects of monetary policy measures, their interaction and their balance over time.", "Overall, central banks do not have the mandate or the tools to deal with societal concerns around excess income or wealth inequality.", "Governments are best placed to address the concerns in their societies around these developments.", "But we do need to ensure that while we take our decisions with a clear goal in mind, we also understand the side effects of our actions and that they do not outweigh the benets.", "There are three things I suggest we should bear in mind.", "First, central banks need trust to succeed.", "Trust is stronger where social capital is strong.", "Central banks can help build social capital through their actions.", "Second, social capital is an important determinant of a community's wellbeing, alongside human capital, natural capital and nancial and physical capital.", "(I like to describe these capitals as our collective \"economic capital\" but that is a subject for another day.)", "An important fact is that social capital does not grow on its own.", "An economy, a society and its environment are all complex systems that constantly interact with each other.", "Societies need to invest in economic, social and environmental infrastructures -
