prices.", "The transfers to the government's savings account have been substantial.", "The picture is now quite different.", "If oil prices remain at today's level, government revenues will fall sharply.", "The present value of future income can in that case be estimated at a fourth of today's oil fund, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG).", "That means that most of the government's petroleum wealth may already have been deposited in the GPFG.", "The year 2015 may stand as the last year of net transfers to the GPFG.", "Already when the budget for 2016 was presented, there were

to between 5 and 15 percent.", "We are also prepared to invest in foreign infrastructure.", "The return on real estate and infrastructure tends to follow a slightly different pattern than the return on equities and bonds.", "Investing in these asset classes is therefore expected to improve the GPFG's risk-return trade-off.", "Looking ahead, the GPFG will likely reduce its allocation to bonds from today's weight of 35 percent.", "For a long-term investor, this is a sensible adjustment.", "At the same time, it will signal that the authorities are willing to accept considerable fluctuations in the return and size of the GPFG, at least on a par with the volatility seen during the financial crisis.", "Even though a number of countries hold substantial foreign exchange reserves, Norway stands out.", "In almost no other country does the central bank manage such a large and diversified investment fund.", "The GPFG has delivered solid results, and its management model has been shown to be robust despite periods of rough weather.", "Transparency, accountability and the safety of capital invested are paramount.", "The organisation has been enlarged to manage a steadily growing and more diversified portfolio.", "Changes in the organisation of the GPFG may come.", "But whatever the future solution may be, the primary objective of investment management must remain firm: the highest possible return for the benefit of current and future generations.", "The GPFG should remain a financial investor.", "If the government were to use the GPFG for other purposes, it would limit the scope for achieving good returns and thereby Norway's fiscal space.", "Central banks in new and uncharted territory Major shifts in export prices have not been alone in posing challenges to the Norwegian economy through history.", "Financial turbulence and banking crises created their own set of challenges.", "Central banks play a particular role in the event of financial turbulence.", "As

bubble.", "When the most recent financial crisis hit Norway in 2008, our role as lender of last resort was again put to the test.", "Access to short-term funding dried up.", "This also affected Norwegian banks.", "Norges Bank had to provide liquidity support, and the government implemented extraordinary measures to safeguard the financial system.", "For Norway, the real economy effects of the financial crisis were short-lived.", "Other countries have had a more difficult time.", "Since the financial crisis, monetary policy in many countries has been stretched close to the limit with the aim of putting economies back on their feet and keeping inflation above zero.", "Many countries are still experiencing weak growth.", "This is not unusual in the wake of a financial crisis.", "A post-crisis economic downturn may prove to be deep, and it may take a long time to reverse the negative trend.", "In a number of countries, little support from other policy areas has made the job particularly demanding.", "Never before in recent history have global interest rates been as low for as long as they are today.", "The interest rate level was moving down long before the 2008 financial crisis.", "What lies behind this is an enduring decline in long-term real interest rates.", "The decline is attributable to structural changes that have weakened the growth capacity of many economies, low productivity growth and weaker growth in the labour force.", "In the wake of the financial crisis, interest rates fell from an already low level to even lower levels.", "Central banks slashed policy rates to counter the downturn.", "The room for further rate cuts was gradually exhausted.", "In this situation, central banks have shown a capacity for new thinking.", "They have purchased securities on a large scale.", "The purchases have continued to push down long-term rates.", "In addition, a barrier has been broken.", "In a number of countries, the policy rate is now negative.", "Negative policy rates can affect the economy via lower bank lending rates and a weaker exchange rate.", "These are well-known channels.", "But the effect of further policy rate cuts may weaken when rates fall below zero.", "An important reason is that banks are reluctant to set negative deposit rates, especially for households.", "For many retail customers, substituting cash for bank deposits is fairly inexpensive.", "If banks hold back on deposit rates, lending rates can only fall to a limited extent before banks' earnings are reduced.", "A lower policy rate may thus have less effect on lending rates than normal, weakening the impact of monetary policy.", "Over the past year, inflation among many of Norway's trading partners has approached zero.", "For many years monetary policy was aimed at preventing high inflation, while it must now seek to avoid inflation that is too low.", "Central banks are in new territory.", "A period of low inflation is not necessarily a problem as long as confidence in the inflation target remains firm.", "But when the room for further policy rate cuts is close to being exhausted, steadily falling inflation could lead to a dangerous downward spiral.", "For every notch that expected future inflation falls, real interest rates rise.", "This has a contractionary effect on the economy.", "In recent years, concerns about falling inflation expectations have prompted central banks to cut policy rates further and to deploy unconventional measures.", "It has been argued that these monetary policy measures are necessary to avoid a further fall in inflation as a result of a stronger exchange rate.", "Interest rate cuts that lead to a currency depreciation push up inflation.", "But countries cannot all weaken their currencies at the same time.", "If many countries cut interest rates to boost inflation via a weaker currency, the benefit may not materialise, while interest rates remain too low with respect to other considerations.", "The financial crisis created unusually strong headwinds in the global economy.", "The persistent decline in long-term rates has been accompanied by a sharp increase in debt levels in many countries.", "Heavily indebted firms, households and government had to embark on an extensive deleveraging process.", "Weak growth prospects have restrained the willingness to invest.", "Heightened uncertainty following the crisis may have reduced risk appetite.", "The result is that the effect of policy rate cuts has diminished.", "For the countries that took the lead, a loose monetary policy appears to have worked.", "In the US, the recovery has been on track for a while and unemployment has declined.", "Before Christmas, the Federal Reserve raised its policy rate for the first time in nine years.", "In Europe, the recovery remains hesitant.", "In emerging economies growth is slowing.", "Since the beginning of the year, global financial markets have been marked by considerable turbulence, likely owing to increased uncertainty about global economic prospects.", "The period of low interest rates is likely far from over.", "The headwinds from the financial crisis are still being felt by many large economies.", "With both interest rates and inflation close to zero, room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is limited.", "Central banks will have little left in their arsenal in the face of a new downturn.", "Other policy areas will then have to take on a greater role.", "A solid financial system over time An environment of persistently low interest rates may pose challenges to financial stability.", "Low interest rates are still driving up debt levels, making economies vulnerable to shocks.", "Just as monetary policy represents the first line of defence in managing the business cycle, regulation and supervision of financial institutions must be the first line of defence in maintaining financial stability.", "It is not sufficient for individual banks to be solid.", "Banks are closely interlinked.", "They obtain funding from common sources and from one another, and large portions of loan exposures are in the same markets.", "High credit growth can result in financial imbalances that have system-wide effects.", "System-wide risk is therefore far greater than the risk of individual banks.", "The financial crisis showed the severe damage that can be caused when insufficient attention is paid to system-wide financial risk.", "Banking regulation has therefore been strengthened by including a macroprudential component.", "The instruments employed are not new, but an important difference is that banks are required to hold more equity capital than previously.", "The required level is based on the overall risks to the financial system.", "Some requirements may vary over time, such as the countercyclical capital buffer.", "The regulation of the Norwegian financial sector is in line with international standards.", "In recent years, a number of instruments have been implemented in Norway to mitigate risk in the banking system.", "In response to the sharp rise in real estate prices and household debt, the countercyclical capital buffer has been increased and bank lending standards tightened.", "Moreover, capital surcharges have been introduced for systemically important banks.", "Norwegian banks have made good use of the solid earnings and low loan losses of recent years.", "Banks have built up their capital and adapted to new buffer requirements.", "The buffers can be used in the event of a pronounced economic downturn.", "Banks will then be able to absorb loan losses without a significant reduction in new lending.", "The build-up of financial imbalances can be difficult to identify.", "Financial crises can occur suddenly and unexpectedly.", "When they do occur, the banking system must be solid.", "Most regulatory components should be as stable as possible.", "The aim of macroprudential supervision cannot be to fine-tune the economy over the business cycle.", "But when financial turbulence occurs, the authorities must be prepared to act quickly and in concert.", "In Norway, the Ministry of Finance has the overriding responsibility for macroprudential supervision.", "It is natural that the political authorities make decisions regarding the framework and permanent regulations.", "It would be an advantage to delegate the responsibility for timevarying instruments to an independent authority with a view to ensuring effective implementation and predictability over time.", "After two decades that can be described as a golden age, the Norwegian economy is heading for a demanding period.", "We have always known that the long oil-driven expansion would come to an end, either because the activity level would pass the peak, or because oil prices would fall.", "We have now reached that juncture.", "The challenges are twofold.", "One challenge consists of further developing the technology and expertise gained in oil production and oil services.", "Costs have been brought down at many stages to strengthen competitiveness in response to lower oil prices.", "If we succeed in this endeavour, the oil industry will continue to be a pillar of the Norwegian economy for many decades ahead.", "The other challenge lies in paving the way for growth in other industries and replacing the revenue shortfall
