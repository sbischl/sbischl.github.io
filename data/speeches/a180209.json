through which it contributed to rising inequality in the past are still forces to be reckoned with.", "It doesn't have to be this way-if we apply fresh thinking in some key areas, we can make policy choices that manage the side effects of innovation, without stifling it.", "Policy-makers themselves need to dig into the technology-the better we understand it and the underlying business incentives,

Technology has benefited skilled workers more than other workers because it has made them more productive.People in more-routine jobs have tended to be replaced entirely.", "Digitalization will likely reinforce this dynamic.", "Machine learning and other technologies mean that tasks requiring routine cognitive skills, such as reading medical scans or preparing legal and investment advice, can now be automated too.", "That said, I do not share the dystopian view of a world without workers.", "People will still have an absolute advantage in tasks that require common sense and a human touch.", "And they will also find employment in areas where they have a comparative advantage.", "The question is not so much whether there will be jobs for people, but, rather, how well they will pay, and

of study more accessible and interesting to students, starting at an early age.", "Improving our track record in terms of gender balance would add to the pool of STEM skills, but this will require

we need the dynamism from firm entry and the contestability of markets to raise the trend line on growth as much as possible.", "Second, the biggest firms may well return to monopoly pricing in the long run.", "These consequences get in the way of stronger, more-inclusive growth.", "That is why we should prioritize the modernization of anti-trust and competition policy, as well as the relevant legal frameworks.", "There are many unanswered questions, especially about how best to remove barriers to entry.", "If user data are the primary source of monopoly rents in the digital age, how should we regulate who owns these data and how they are shared?", "Some interesting ideas include giving users control of their data-perhaps even making firms pay users for their data-and regulating tech platforms as utilities.", "Intellectual property rights present similar issues.", "Patents are a key way to protect the return on valuable research and development.", "Given that they create barriers to entry and that the pace of technological change is accelerating, do we need to rethink our approach?", "It is good to see authorities across the G7 countries looking at all these issues.", "International collaboration is necessary because of the ubiquity and cross-border nature of many digital services.", "New technologies pose additional regulatory and legal questions.", "For example, the sheer complexity of algorithms used for data analytics makes them difficult to interpret, audit and govern.", "In some cases, algorithmic pricing could lead to tacit collusion-price fixing without the quiet glass of scotch between commercial rivals.", "Even if it were identified, tacit collusion would not meet some current legal definitions of collusion.", "Legal clarity is also required in many jurisdictions with respect to data privacy, information security and consumer rights.", "We also need to determine how best to manage the risks that concentration in digital services can pose for the financial system.", "Top of mind for me are the growing operational risks (including cyber risks) from a very concentrated set of third-party service providers that our financial institutions use-cloud services, data aggregators and related analytics.", "How concerned should we be about these third parties-telecommunications companies and tech companies-given that they typically fall outside the current regulatory perimeter?", "This is another question that would benefit from concerted attention at the international level.", "Good progress is already being made on issues related to international taxation to avoid base erosion and profit shifting.", "Policy-makers need to dig in This brings me to my final point.", "Policy-makers need to dig in and be proactive.", "Good policy decisions can only come from a clear understanding of the new technologies and the related business incentives.", "Let me give some examples from my own backyard.", "At the Bank of Canada, we are focused on understanding the many ways in which digitalization and automation are affecting the economy and the financial system.", "For example, as nontraditional pricing models become more prevalent, we are rethinking how best to measure inflation.", "We are looking at how digitalization might be affecting labour markets and the transmission of monetary policy, and how a global digital marketplace for goods and services changes the ways in which domestic inflation pressures are generated.", "Our researchers are also studying emerging technologies in financial services to understand how the ecosystem is evolving, and to spot new risks as they emerge.", "The workforce needs to have the right skills for the digital economy.", "So do public policy-makers.", "The Bank of Canada has several irons in the fire that take a learning-by-doing approach; one example is the work staff are undertaking to apply machine learning and techniques such as distant reading to analyze vast amounts of unstructured information.", "The goals are to increase the range and depth of skills of our staff, improve our projections and reduce the uncertainty we face when making policy decisions.", "We are also working on how we could use machine-learning applications to increase efficiencies and manage operational risks in all parts of our business.", "All the institutions represented in this room are doing interesting work in this area.", "Public sector institutions need to innovate in their business cultures.", "We should be open to more-diverse perspectives and expertise, work more often with private sector experts and take manageable risks.", "The Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are leaders in exploring fintech with the private sector.", "The Bank of Canada also has several experiments under way.", "One is in partnership with the TMX Group and Payments Canada.", "It uses distributed ledger technology to build a delivery versus payment settlement system for securities.", "Our experience with these types of partnerships so far is that we can quickly harness deep subject matter and business expertise, define realistic yet ambitious objectives and make faster progress than if we were working alone.", "It's good to see that G7 central banks, among others, have already been comparing notes on our work in these areas.", "It is time to conclude.", "I do not need to convince you that the digital economy is a promising way to raise trend growth and overall living standards.", "We cannot be satisfied, though, if some of the potential gains are left on the table, because many people will be left behind and important markets will be virtually uncontestable.", "It does not have to be this way if we choose a road for policy that effectively manages the downsides of innovation without stifling it.", "Of all the areas where we could develop and implement a better strategy, here are my top three: (i) develop a dynamic workforce with the skills to match the jobs, and encourage more labour force participation; (ii) keep market power in check, particularly the power that comes from control of consumer data, to encourage competition and limit monopoly profits; and (iii) manage the growing operational risks associated with the digital services that are provided by a concentrated set of firms to systemically important financial institutions.", "We will need to judge wisely when it is best to use public policy tools to manage risks and when to let private enterprise work its magic.", "We'll need to work together and in the field to inform these judgments.", "I am confident that, together, the G7 will show leadership and will build with the private sector a shared sense of responsibility for the future.", "I would like to thank Gurnain K.
