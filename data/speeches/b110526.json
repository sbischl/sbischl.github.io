hit hard by the global crisis The high degree of integration and interconnectedness of financial markets contributed to the amplification and spread of the financial crisis around the world.", "The crisis had devastating effects on both the banking sector and the real economy, in particular in international financial centers with a high concentration of activities in banking, trading etc.", "They are the nodes of a global network.", "By consequence, the global financial crisis hit Luxembourg's open economy and internationally-integrated financial center - although relatively less than the neighboring countries, such as Germany and France.", "Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund center in terms of size (after the United States) and the largest in terms of interconnectedness, the most important private banking center in the euro zone and Europe's leading center for reinsurance companies.", "Moreover, Luxembourg is among the 25 most systemically important financial centers in the world.", "At the height of the crisis, Luxembourg's sizeable investment fund industry endured substantial redemptions and its foreign-subsidiary dominated banking system experienced a sharp drop in the aggregate balance sheet as well as in the off-balance sheet positions.", "This led to a 20 percent contraction in the aggregate balance sheet of the foreign-subsidiary dominated banking system in Luxembourg.", "Banks have also seen a 30 percent drop in their off-balance sheet positions as assets under management dwindled.", "About 8 percent of the financial sector's work force lost their jobs, only a part of which could be re-employed by other institutes.", "Still, Luxemburg was less scathed by the financial crisis than countries with a highly leveraged home banking sector that sometimes had expanded excessively abroad.", "Moreover, the overall situation has since stabilized.", "No bank rescues were required since 2009 and investment fund assets have rebounded beyond pre-crisis peaks.", "In 2010, the number of investment funds that have been registered in Luxembourg increased by 5.9 percent to 3,463.", "The net asset value in turn rose by around 20 percent to 2.2 billion Euros.", "Thanks also to the global recovery and developments in neighboring countries, growth resumed early in the second half of 2009 and labor markets showed initial signs of recovery.", "Last year, Luxemburg's Gross Domestic Product expanded by 31\u20442 percent -

First, they focus on strengthening micro-prudential regulations, aiming to bolster the resilience of individual banks during periods of stress.", "In particular, Basel III calls for more and better capital of financial institutions and also introduces leverage ratios and stresses the role of liquidity risk.", "- Second, they also include macro-prudential regulations, aiming to mitigate systemic risks across the banking system.", "Better and more capital buffers are supposed to make the banking sector more resilient in the case of another crisis.", "The increased capital requirement may come at high cost, though.", "If banks hold too little capital, they are left crisis-prone and in the potential need of bail-outs.", "Too much capital, however, could lead to huge swathes of the banking business becoming unprofitable.", "This might cause higher borrowing cost which could affect economic growth negatively.", "By consequence, riskier assets but more profitable activities might be driven into the shadow-banking sector.", "But the regulation of the shadow banking system is still an unsolved issue.", "These entities are no banks in the legal sense, although they take - and generate - similar risks.", "If there is a strict silo-regulation of the formal banking sector, the actual risky business does not disappear, but moves on in the non-regulated sector.", "An important issue is the problems of banks that have become too big or too interconnected to fail.", "The idea that a \"Systemically Important Financial institution\", SIFI, will be saved in a crisis because of its systemic importance is not compatible with the core principles of a market economy.", "Those who fail in the market have to bear the ultimate consequence of leaving the market.", "But if the maxim is \"too big to fail\", then the state and the taxpayers are vulnerable to blackmail.", "The financial crisis has exacerbated the problem in so far as some of the surviving banks have become even bigger or more interconnected.", "Moreover, the government guarantees which were appropriate in the crisis now encourage banks to grow, to connect and to take even bigger risks.", "To repair this clearly flawed incentive structure, the G20 endorsed the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) policy framework to address the moral hazard risks and externalities posed by SIFIs.", "The key policy objectives of the FSB SIFI framework are to (i) increase their loss absorption capacity to reduce the likelihood of their failure, (ii) to facilitate the orderly restructuring or unwinding of a failing SIFI to reduce the impact of its failure on the financial system (\"living will\"); (iii) to intensify supervisory oversight for SIFIs; (iv) to strengthen core financial market infrastructures to reduce contagion risk from failure.", "Challenges imposed by liquidity rules Though it is highly welcome that the new rules tackle liquidity risks, the new requirements for liquidity management could themselves become a source of instability.", "One reason is that the regulators' definition of liquidity is highly concentrated on government bonds.", "As the current environment shows, some market segments of government bonds can eventually dry up.", "Another reason is the respective definitions of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).", "- The LCR is the main component of Basel III's liquidity regime.", "It is also known as the \"Bear Stearns rule\".", "It requires banks to maintain a stock of \"high-quality liquid assets\" that is sufficient to cover net cash outflows for a 30-day period under financial stress.", "- The NSFR seeks to counter maturity mismatches in the balance sheet of financial institutions.", "It calculates the proportion of long-term assets, which need to be funded by longer term stable funding.", "While the LCR stresses the liquidity situation up to 30 days, the NSFR focuses on the situation beyond one year.", "Assets which are liquid for more than 30 days and less than one year are not taken into account, not even on a weighted basis.", "However, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has recognized this shortcoming and is investigating the issue.", "In addition, there is the risk that the reformed banking regulation has damaging impact on the European model.", "The treatment of covered bonds, mutual funds, deposits etc.", "in the liquidity ratios affect the business model oft many continental European banks.", "One can also question whether the main victims of the new rules will not be the European universal banking model which was certainly not at the origin of the crisis but constituted an anchor of stability.", "Finally, the lack of a resolution framework for cross-border financial institutions remains on the agenda.", "In spite of the insight, that the reform of regulation and supervision cannot be successful at the national level alone, it is still unclear how the costs would be distributed if a cross-border institution would get into difficulty and should need to be saved.", "Shortcomings in macro prudential supervision ...
