Tier 1 and total risk-based capital - were actually rising in the period when holders of Wachovia's liabilities were becoming concerned, and thus the broader definitions of capital were not particularly informative.", "The more narrow definitions of capital -

a period of significant financial turmoil, when many private-sector analysts and academic observers had raised concerns about the financial condition of the U.S. banking industry.", "The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (\"SCAP\") was designed to provide a rigorous assessment and, in doing so, to ensure that banks had sufficient capital to sustain additional losses and still continue providing critical credit intermediation should economic conditions deteriorate further.", "The SCAP exercise was conducted with the 19 largest U.S. domiciled bank holding companies.", "Each bank holding company was provided a baseline economic scenario and a more stressful scenario.", "The scenarios were based on publicly available private forecasts and provided the assumed path for real GDP, unemployment, and house prices over the next two years.", "Using these assumptions, the banks were asked to provide detailed portfolio information so that projections could be made on losses in a variety of loan and security categories, potential trading losses for firms with large trading operations, pre-provision net revenue, and the allowance for loan losses -

by measures such as restricting payouts, raising new equity, selling assets, or utilizing capital available from the U.S. Treasury.", "Banks both with and without shortfalls aggressively sold assets and raised additional capital, resulting in a very significant recapitalization of the 19 banks over a relatively short period of time - as is apparent in the figures shown earlier.", "Stress testing and discretionary capital distributions Now I would like to mention the role of other stress testing in decisions to pursue, and approve, the resumption of discretionary capital distributions.", "The SCAP was designed to estimate how banks would perform under stress conditions.", "However, the economic assumptions and the impact of those economic assumptions on financial institutions were by definition educated estimates of potential outcomes.", "By the end of 2010, many banks were noting that they had substantially recapitalized and in some cases were now well above regulatory minimums - and thus would like to resume or increase stock buybacks or dividend payments.", "To evaluate the requests by banks to increase dividend payments, U.S. bank supervisors pursued an exercise known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and stress testing was one component of that broader exercise.", "While the stress testing element was only part of the CCAR review, it was an important input into evaluating banks' capital planning.", "The assessment was conducted between November 2010 and March 2011.", "Once again the largest 19 U.S. domiciled bank holding companies were asked to participate, using a baseline scenario, their own stress scenario, and a supervisor-provided stress scenario (a set of macroeconomic assumptions consistent with an economic downturn).", "A critical benchmark was whether banks could meet a 5 percent Tier 1 common capital ratio under stress conditions over the next two years, assuming they paid dividends or carried out the stock buybacks as they proposed.", "Additional capital measures were examined, including the ability to satisfy over time the new Basel III capital ratios and changes in capital required by the Dodd-Frank legislation.", "Bank holding companies were required to provide information on their capital adequacy processes and capital distribution policies, and supervisors assessed them.", "Conducting the analysis for all of these institutions simultaneously gave supervisors a good benchmark as to how the financial institutions were performing relative to a stress scenario.", "In addition to providing a method for evaluating capital assessments, the stress test that was one component of the broader CCAR provided an opportunity to determine how financial institutions had refined their ability to conduct stress tests and incorporated lessons learned from the SCAP.", "In that vein, these types of capital assessments are likely to be an important tool in understanding the capital planning process in the future.", "Concluding observations In conclusion I would note that the financial crisis highlighted that financial institutions did not have the quality or quantity of capital they needed.", "In particular, the broader measures of capital were largely ignored during the crisis by many investors as they worried about the \"core\" capital immediately available to absorb losses.", "Thus the emphasis in Basel III on improving the quality and quantity of capital is an important regulatory response to the financial crisis.", "Clearly we need to focus on the narrow definitions of capital - that which can readily absorb losses.", "The United States has also improved its supervision framework based on lessons learned during the crisis.", "One of the major additions to the supervisory \"toolkit\" was the use of stress tests - in the SCAP and then as an important component of the broader CCAR exercise.", "The supervisory and regulatory responses have provided strong encouragement for U.S. financial institutions to improve their capital ratios, particularly those ratios most appropriate for absorbing losses during stressful economic periods.", "Through retention of earnings, asset sales, and new equity issuances, U.S. banks have substantially improved their capital ratios since the crisis period.", "The severe disruptions and economic dislocations that occurred during the financial crisis - affecting not just institutions, but individuals throughout the national and global economy - highlight the critical need to maintain a well-capitalized and resilient financial sector.", "Bank regulation and bank supervision - not to mention management practices within financial institutions - all need to continue to evolve to ensure that during periods of economic or financial distress, organizations remain well capitalized so their role in credit intermediation is not disrupted.", "I hope the analysis and observations I have shared today can assist with a process of learning, evolving, and improving that will prevent future disruptions."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none"], "topics": ["Financial Stability", "Capital", "Basel III", "Stress Tests", "Regulatory Framework", "Financial Crisis", "Capital Adequacy", "Supervisory Oversight", "Capital Distributions", "Financial Intermediation"]}
