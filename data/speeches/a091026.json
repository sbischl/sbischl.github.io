prices in the past two decades has also been very strong compared with countries where housing bubbles have burst.", "To finance strong growth in residential mortgages, banks have to rely to a great extent on borrowing, thereby increasing their vulnerability to a liquidity squeeze.", "Thus, low risk weights for residential mortgages also lead to higher liquidity risk in the banking system as a whole.", "It is important to be aware of the similarities between developments in the Norwegian housing market and bank lending and developments in the countries most severely affected by the crisis.", "In Norway, the lead-up was similar with rising house prices, accelerating credit and consumption growth and lower saving.", "Interest rate setting managed to stabilise developments somewhat.", "Economic policy was perhaps more successful in Norway and the government had larger buffers.", "But the soft landing in the Norwegian economy so far is also attributable to a good measure of luck, not least as oil prices rapidly rebounded after falling from USD150 per barrel to 35.", "Stricter requirements for systemically important banks The bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers rapidly led to a general crisis of confidence in the financial system.", "Central banks and government authorities implemented extensive measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis.", "At a meeting in Washington on 10 October 2008, the G7 countries stated that they would protect their systemically important institutions.", "This was a decisive measure.", "But the social and economic costs have been considerable, particularly reflected in the dramatic fall in output and employment in most advanced economies.", "Moreover, government support for banks has been costly in many countries.", "The crisis has shown that regulation of systemically important banks should be considerably more stringent.", "This can be achieved by introducing overall higher capital requirements or seeking to restrict growth in these institutions by imposing stricter requirements than for other banks.", "In Switzerland, it has been decided that the capital adequacy requirement for the country's two large banks in good times will be twice the international minimum requirement.", "To prevent a procyclical impact, this target will apply as of 2013.10 In Norway and other countries, all banks are subject to the same capital adequacy requirements, but the large banks have generally chosen to leverage their capital further than other banks.", "The UK government intends to propose a plan that would require large banks to elaborate a plan for orderly unwinding, often referred to as \"living wills\", stating which parts of a bank's operations will be sold if a distressed bank is compelled to raise fresh capital.", "The authorities will then be able to split up or wind down banks quickly, whatever their size or complexity.", "But an additional economic cost is incurred when governments rescue banks.", "This may have adverse effects on bank behaviour.", "In the field, this is referred to as measures that increase the risk of moral hazard.", "I can provide an example.", "A creditor may for example assume that big banks are in practice \"insured\" by the authorities, which will also be reflected in rating agencies' assessments.", "Banks considered systemically important receive a higher rating.", "As a result, funding costs for these banks are lower, allowing them to increase leverage and expand even further.", "Reducing the procyclicality of bank behaviour Both international studies and Norges Bank studies indicate that the current capital adequacy rules, Basel II, amplify the procyclical effects arising from bank behaviour.", "During an expansion, bank earnings are high.", "Ample supply of capital leads to high credit growth.", "In a downturn, loan losses increase and erode the banks' capital.", "Banks respond by tightening lending.", "Bank behaviour therefore amplifies fluctuations in economic activity.", "An analysis by Norges Bank sheds light on the procyclical effects of the Basel II capital requirements.", "The analysis is based on a path where the Norwegian economy is exposed to a severe disturbance.", "During a downturn, the debt-servicing capacity of borrowers declines and the value of bank collateral falls.", "The risk of bank losses increases.", "This leads to an upward adjustment of the risk weights used to calculate the minimum capital requirement under Basel II.", "The minimum capital requirement increases.", "The shorter the data series applied by banks in their risk models are, the more the capital requirements fluctuate with business cycles.", "The effects may be considerable.", "Higher capital requirements for banks in a downturn will amplify the downturn.", "In an upturn, the effect will be the opposite.", "If banks apply a time series that is longer than 20 years, which includes at least one pronounced economic downturn, the effect on the minimum capital requirement during a downturn under Basel II will not be as strong as when the banks use short series.", "Risk weights calculated on short series that do not include downturns are thus of little value.", "There are also other approaches to reducing the procyclicality of bank behaviour.", "In Spain, banks have had to provision for potential losses through the cycle.", "They were required to provision using non-tax deductible amounts for future losses at the time the loan was extended.", "Such dynamic provisioning has probably functioned effectively also because this system did not require that the supervisory authorities or the banks themselves had to decide that capital should be increased.", "Nordic cooperation Equal competition considerations require that banking rules are practiced as evenly as possible across countries.", "For Norway, there are limits to how effectively regulations specific to Norway will be because we are part of the Nordic banking market.", "The Nordic region, however, is a well-suited region for an active use of regulatory measures.", "Nordic banks engage in cross-border operations.", "At the same time, they have little activity outside of the Nordic region.", "Nor are foreign banks from other regions large in this region.", "The conditions are therefore in place for effective cooperation in the area of banking regulation and crisis management between the political authorities, supervisory authorities and central banks.", "In the growth period from 2004 to 2008, foreign banks expanded rapidly in the Nordic market, but during and after the crisis they curbed their activity.", "I am afraid it can be said that they have amplified fluctuations in Norwegian markets.", "However, we assume the decline in their market share over the past year is attributable to their being harder hit by the international crisis than Norwegian banks.", "Liquidity management More capital is important for the solidity of the banking sector.", "However, we must not forget that the turbulence first translated into a liquidity crisis, as was the case for the UK bank Northern Rock in autumn 2007 when depositors rushed to withdraw their savings.", "For Norwegian banks, the crisis has essentially been a liquidity crisis.", "Norwegian banks were affected because they became dependent on market funding.", "The financial crisis has revealed that substantial short-term money market funding is risky.", "When it comes from foreign markets, the risk of funding shortfalls increases.", "In the mid-1980s, Norwegian banks also borrowed heavily in foreign markets.", "In spring 1986 - following a sharp fall in oil prices - confidence in the Norwegian economy plummeted, and liquidity flowed out of the country as was the case in autumn last year.", "The funding source that is considered to be the most stable, deposits, has become less important over time.", "It is our assessment that the funding of Norwegian banks is a structural problem.", "When the financial crisis is behind us, we expect banks to give increased weight to deposits and long-term loans as funding sources.", "The maturity of banks' market funding should be longer than it was before the financial turbulence.", "During the financial crisis, investors were reluctant to provide long-term funding and required high risk premiums.", "Prospects for banks in general have now improved and risk premiums have declined.", "Strengthening of banks' equity capital is helping to reduce the risk facing bondholders.", "Bond premiums are nevertheless likely to remain clearly higher than prior to the financial crisis.", "Investors cannot be certain that government will cover bond investors' losses when banks' capital evaporates during the next banking crisis, c.f.", "the planned UK proposal to impose a \"living will\" on the large institutions.", "A favourable source of funding for banks is covered bonds, referred to as OMF in Norway.", "These debt instruments are secured by sound collateral backed by residential mortgages, public loans or commercial property loans.", "The risk premium on these loans is therefore lower than on ordinary bank bonds.", "The covered bond market was also heavily impacted by the financial crisis.", "Activity in the secondary market has been low, and investors showed little interest in new issues.", "The swap arrangement introduced by the Norwegian authorities eased the situation for banks.", "The market has recently improved.", "Covered bonds have a long tradition in other countries' housing markets.", "As manager of the Government Pension Fund - Global, Norges Bank has taken initiative to strengthen the European covered bond market.", "Together with several other large investors and support from a number of central banks, the \"Covered Bond Investor Council\" was established.", "One of the main aims of the Council is to improve liquidity in the covered bond market, through for example more transparent and standardised borrowing terms.", "The Norwegian covered bond market is new and small compared with that of other countries.", "Covered bonds are well suited for pension portfolios and other assets with a long time horizon.", "Further ahead, there should therefore be good possibilities for Norwegian banks to procure long-term funding.", "Since residential mortgages usually feature a long maturity, bonds should also have a long maturity.", "Before the financial crisis, mortgage-backed covered bonds were normally issued with a maturity of five to ten years in European countries.", "But this source of funding also has its limitations.", "The larger the share of borrowing that has first claim on banks' assets is, the higher the risk becomes for other lenders and for depositors with savings above the guaranteed amount.", "The risk for the Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund may increase if covered bonds become too dominant.", "The Basel rules require capital for banks' assets, but do not stipulate how the assets are to be financed or their liquidity.", "It is now being considered whether common requirements should be introduced as to the amount of liquid assets a bank must hold to survive a stress situation over a period of for example 30 days without drawing on loans in the central bank.", "In addition, there will be funding stability requirements.", "The Basel Committee is expected to make concrete proposals in the course of the year.", "One of the first countries that introduced stricter requirements is the UK, where banks are required to apply a stress situation with a duration of three months.", "Assets that would qualify as sufficiently liquid should be easily sold in the market - also in stress situations.", "The financial crisis showed that many assets held by banks for liquidity purposes were not particularly liquid.", "In the UK, the authorities will only accept that banks' liquidity buffers include government bonds of high quality and deposits in the central bank.", "Norges Bank's macroprudential supervision - use of stress tests Through recent decades, financial stability analyses have become increasingly important in many central banks.", "An important element in the analysis is to assess the vulnerability of the financial system to macroeconomic disturbances.", "Stress tests are commonly used in this exercise.", "Norges Bank uses stress tests to assess the consequences for Norwegian banks of several risks having a negative impact simultaneously.", "We will develop this tool further and take account of the experiences of other countries.", "We will seek to be transparent about the assumptions and results.", "Asset prices, credit and monetary policy There is a division of roles in economic policy.", "Fiscal policy, through growth in public spending, influences the real krone exchange rate and the size of the international exposed business sector in the long term.", "Monetary policy steers inflation in the medium and long term and can in addition contribute to smoothing fluctuations in output and employment.", "House prices in Norway have risen sharply and probably excessively.", "We must take account of developments in equity prices and property prices when projecting inflation and output.", "Norges Bank's interest rate setting does not rely solely on one simple rule.", "Instead, we seek to take account of all factors that influence inflation and output in the medium term, and the key policy rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment.", "Asset prices such as house prices, the exchange rate and credit growth therefore have a bearing on Norges Bank's interest rate setting.", "A written formulation of Norges Bank's monetary policy reaction function would be fairly comprehensive and include all the variables that are considered.", "However, a reaction function must not be confused with the monetary policy target - our target function.", "The fact that we give weight to variables such as the exchange rate, house prices and credit growth in interest rate setting does not imply that there are specific target for these variables.", "The operational target for monetary policy is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time.", "Interest rate setting in a small, open economy can be particularly challenging in periods of strong credit growth and a wide interest rate differential against other countries.", "A tightening of monetary policy in Norway specifically aimed at curbing property prices and credit growth can result in a rising krone exchange rate, a weaker labour market and excessively low inflation.", "Should we seek to avert bubbles in the housing market even when medium-term inflation prospects are moderate?", "On this point, it is our judgement that a distinction must be made between giving greater weight to credit growth and house price inflation in the reaction function and defining house price inflation as an independent monetary policy objective.", "Socalled \"leaning against the wind\" would not require adjustments to Norges Bank's approach, bearing in mind that our reaction function already gives weight to asset price movements and credit growth.", "Should central banks also set explicit targets for asset prices?", "In our judgment the answer is no, but we should probably apply a fairly long horizon for achieving the target so that we seek to take account of any imbalances that might disturb activity and inflation further ahead.", "Household behaviour in the housing market is a considerable economy policy challenge.", "This is primarily because demand for housing and housing loans is heavily subsidised by the tax system and loan supply is marked by the near-absence of an equity capital requirement for providing housing loans.", "In line with other countries, the Norwegian authorities implement extensive measures to improve banks' access to liquidity and longer term funding after the Lehman Brothers failure.", "This contributed to improved funding conditions for Norwegian banks.", "As the situation in financial markets returns to normal, the measures will be wound down.", "Recently, we have seen an improvement in money and credit markets.", "We have therefore started reducing the use of unconventional measures.", "In recent months, liquidity has not been supplied through currency swap lines or liquidity in foreign currency.", "Loans at long maturities have not been provided since February - several of the loans have now matured.", "As markets are now returning to normal, liquidity supply will be adjusted so that money market rates reflect the key policy rate.", "We want the banks to redistribute liquidity in the interbank market.", "The underlying structural liquidity in the banking system, i.e.", "liquidity excluding Norges Bank's liquidity provision, has been negative in recent years.", "Structural liquidity is influenced by ingoing and outgoing payments via the government's account in Norges Bank and is projected to increase ahead, primarily because the government can partly finance increased lending to state banks, payments from the Government Bond Fund and the State Finance Fund and share subscriptions by drawing on their large deposits in Norges Bank.", "The banking system's demand for central bank loans will then decrease considerably.", "The swap arrangement involving covered bonds in exchange for government securities has made a considerable contribution to securing banks' long-term funding.", "This spring we saw that the covered bond market started to reopen.", "The minimum price in the swap arrangement is thus adjusted to the interest rate forming in the market.", "The arrangement will be phased out in the course of autumn.", "Norges Bank temporarily eased its collateral requirements to facilitate banks' access to borrowing in the central bank.", "Banks' borrowing needs are falling, and a good supply of highquality collateral, particularly Treasury notes, has increased markedly.", "We are of the view that the conditions are now appropriate for reversing these temporary changes.", "We will also tighten the collateral requirements.", "Today the planned changes have been circulated for comment.", "The acceptance of new securities eligible as collateral under the temporary rules is now discontinued.", "Securities that were already accepted as collateral under the temporary rules can normally be used as collateral until they mature or up to no later than 15 February 2012 when the last long-term fixed-rate loan in Norges Bank has matured.", "We have also announced a change in the so-called bank quota.", "Under today's rules, 35 per cent of a bank's borrowing facility in Norges Bank can be based on collateral in bonds issued by other Norwegian banks.", "It is a disadvantage that the provider of the collateral and the collateral are from the same sector.", "At the same time, it is a competitive disadvantage for Norwegian banks when their issues are covered by the quota, while this is not the case for issues by for example Swedish and Danish banks.", "Therefore, from 1 December 2010 we will include foreign bank issues in the bank quota without increasing the percentage rate of 35.", "From 15 February 2012, we will discontinue access to using bank issues as collateral for loans.", "Covered bonds will still be eligible as collateral, also when the bonds are issued by a bank's own mortgage company.", "We assume that this will also contribute to developing the Norwegian covered bond market.", "Developments in recent months indicate that the financial crisis in Norway will not develop into a real economic crisis.", "We have not experienced a bank solvency crisis as was the case 20 years ago.", "Unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks, we expect the bankruptcy rate for Norwegian enterprises to stabilise or to be at about the same level recorded in the moderate downturn at the beginning of this decade.", "Nevertheless, the crisis has revealed weaknesses in the regulatory framework for banks, also in Norway.", "It is our hope and belief that international cooperation will set the stage for an improved regulatory framework and systems.", "For us in Norway, it is important that the Nordic
