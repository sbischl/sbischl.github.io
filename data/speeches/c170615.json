sector, seizing opportunities and managing risks is your core business.", "Being a prudential regulator, you'll forgive me if I start by discussing the risks.", "There are generally two types of climate-related risk.", "First, physical risks: the impact today on insurance liabilities and the value of financial assets arising from climate-related events, such as floods and storms that damage property or disrupt trade.", "Second, transition risk: the financial risks that could result from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy.", "Changes in policy, technology and physical

of London study estimated that the twenty centimeter rise in sea-level around Manhattan since the 1950s increased insured losses from superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone.", "Ever since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 led to serious losses, the insurance industry has used natural catastrophe models to analyse and measure risk more accurately.", "Use of these instruments is now the norm.", "Insurers

financial institutions.", "Transition risk could also be called the risk of success.", "Take for example the commitment made in Paris to limit global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius.", "Estimates vary, but it is certain that the remaining budget for carbon emission relating to this target will make large amounts of existing reserves of oil, gas and coal unusable.", "The exposure of financial institutions to the resulting write-offs of these stranded assets and the repricing of companies is potentially huge, and could pose a threat to financial stability.", "Possible delays in policy changes do not remove these risks, but magnify them.", "This is because we may see more significant and abrupt policy changes and market adjustments further down the road.", "This is very important: the longer we wait, the more radical the measures need to be.", "What I want to stress to you is that despite the uncertainty, or even controversy, about the pace at which new policies are

nuclear energy, carbon capture and storage amount to as much as 1 trillion euro annually.", "Technological innovation is assisting this transition.", "This includes developing efficient heating solutions, advances in LED lighting technology, utilizing geothermal power, and developing electric vehicles.", "I know there is still considerable uncertainty about the potential returns on these investments.", "But I expect this uncertainty to diminish significantly as international disclosure standards make climate risk more transparent, and governments introduce clarity by setting targets, rules and deadlines.", "This has the potential to transform green investment from a niche market into a major investment class of its own.. Let me give you an example of how public policy can kick-start a whole new market for green investment: early this year the Dutch housing ministry introduced new rules requiring all commercial real estate in the Netherlands to have an energy rating label of C or better as of 2023.", "Buildings that fail to meet this requirement can no longer be used as offices.", "Dutch banks are getting involved by adding surcharges to, or outright withholding, funding for non-sustainable buildings.", "At the same time they are offering energy efficiency plans and financing to owners that need to upgrade their buildings.", "Expectations are that the estimated 860 million euro in investments necessary to meet the target will be realized much earlier than 2023.", "I name but two: All new public transportations busses in The Netherlands will be emission-free as of 2025.", "According to current government policy in The Netherlands the same holds true for all new passenger cars of 2035.", "My expectation is that this process will play itself out over and over again in an increasing number of sectors within the economy.", "Public authorities will set deadlines.", "Deadlines for zero-emissions/climate neutrality to be reached by in public transportation in aviation in agriculture in manufacturing etc etc And the private sector will jump on the opportunity.", "And often beat the deadline.", "As it makes business sense to do so.", "After all, by acting now, financial institutions have a first mover advantage over their competitors.", "They can build up specialized knowledge that is valuable for assessing risk and return.", "For example, over 90% of wind farms in the Netherlands are financed by one bank.", "The same argument applies to all kinds of financing for frontrunners in sustainability.", "Despite uncertainty over how public regulation will develop, there is still plenty of opportunity for no-regret actions.", "Ladies and gentlemen, International consensus has been growing for some time that climate change is an urgent problem.", "What is new is the growing resolve among governments across the globe to do something about it.", "And I am

actors in the US, and foster even greater international cooperation.", "Both climate change and government action will create new risks and opportunities.", "Risks and opportunities that you can and should anticipate today.", "So sit around the table with your authorities to discuss the obstacles for sustainable finance, and what changes in regulation are necessary.", "As our experiences with the Platform on Sustainable Finance in the Netherlands show, your input is highly valuable.", "Don't get me wrong: I am not here to sell you anything.", "As a regulator it is not my place to convince you to start financing green investment, or to buy green bonds just for the sake of it.", "Some of you may even be skeptical about the scientific evidence for climate change, still others may doubt the ability of governments to take action.", "Coming from an oil and gas-addicted little country below sea level, I would understand you for not believing me.", "But you don't have to.", "As uniform

"Those soldiers overcame the challenge brilliantly by showing courage, devotion and skill.", "And I believe this spirit is still alive and well in the British business community.", "It's the spirit that does not walk away from a challenge, but stands up to meet it, and turns it into an opportunity.", "Not oblivious to risk and danger, but with your minds and motives sharpened by it.", "Aware that what is in your company's interest also helps preserve a world that is rapidly changing.", "The challenge today is called climate change.", "Let's be aware of the risks and turn them into opportunities.", "Ladies and gentlemen I wish you a productive, stimulating and memorable conference."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
