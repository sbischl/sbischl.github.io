payments over time.", "Third, some foreign countries have chosen to develop and, in some cases, deploy their own CBDC.", "Although each country will decide whether to issue a CBDC based on its unique domestic conditions, the issuance of a CBDC in one jurisdiction, along with its prominent use in cross-border payments, could have significant effects across the globe.", "Given the potential for CBDCs to gain prominence in cross-border payments and the reserve currency role of the dollar, it is vital for the United States to be at the table in the development of cross-border standards.",

discuss several of the most prominent considerations.", "Preserve general access to safe central bank money Central bank money is important for payment systems because it represents a safe settlement asset, allowing users to exchange central bank liabilities without concern about liquidity and credit risk.", "Consumers and businesses don't generally consider whether the money they are using is a liability of the central bank, as with cash, or of a commercial bank, as with bank deposits.", "This is largely because the two are seamlessly interchangeable for most purposes owing to the provision of federal deposit insurance and banking supervision, which provide protection for consumers and businesses alike.", "It is not obvious that new forms of private money that reference fiat currency, like stablecoins, can carry the same level of protection as bank deposits or fiat currency.", "Although various federal and state laws establish protections for users, nonbank issuers of private money are not regulated to the same extent as banks, the value stored in these systems is not insured directly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and consumers may be at risk that the issuer will not be able to honor its liabilities.", "New forms of private money may introduce counterparty risk into the payments system in new ways that could lead to consumer protection threats or, at large scale, broader financial stability risks.", "In contrast, a digital dollar would be a new type of central bank money issued in digital form for use by the general public.", "By introducing safe central bank money that is accessible to households and businesses in digital payments systems, a CBDC would reduce counterparty risk and the associated consumer protection and financial stability risks.", "Improve efficiency One expected benefit is that a CBDC would reduce or even eliminate operational and financial inefficiencies, or other frictions, in payments, clearing, and settlement.",

activities are conducted and the roles of financial intermediaries and infrastructures.", "The introduction of a CBDC may provide an important foundation for beneficial innovation and competition in

Infrastructures, and the G7 to ensure the U.S. stays abreast of developments related to CBDC abroad.", "We are engaging in several international efforts to improve the transparency, timeliness, and

bank accounts.", "Preserve financial stability and monetary policy transmission The introduction of a CBDC has the potential to have wide-reaching effects, and there are open questions about how CBDC could affect financial stability and monetary policy transmission.", "Some research indicates that the introduction of a CBDC might raise the risk of a flight out of deposits at weak banks in favor of CBDC holdings at moments of financial stress.", "Other research indicates that the increase in competition could result in more attractive terms on transactions accounts and an overall increase in banking system deposits.", "Banks play a critical role in credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission, as well as in payments.", "Thus, the design of any CBDC would need to include safeguards to protect against disintermediation of banks and to preserve monetary policy transmission more broadly.", "While it is critical to consider the ways in which a CBDC could introduce risks relative to the current payments system, it may increase resilience relative to a payments system where private money is prominent.", "Protect privacy and safeguard financial integrity The design of
