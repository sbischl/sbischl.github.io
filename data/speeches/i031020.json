continent today.", "However, it is widely accepted that economic development goes beyond the mere maximisation of economic growth.", "The distributional consequences of economic growth are of paramount importance.", "Given their potential to address both the growth and distributional concerns of economic policy, it is imperative that appropriate attention is given to the promotion of

3,1 percent in 2002, compared to 3,8 percent in 2001.", "Subdued economic activity in 2002 was due to the weak global economy, the slower-than-expected rebound in world trade, droughts, and political and armed conflicts in some parts of the continent.", "The latest IMF forecast released in September 2003 projects that GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) will rise to 3,6 percent in 2003, mainly as a result of the expected global recovery, improved macroeconomic policies, rising commodity prices and the debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.", "While the economic growth rate in Africa compares quite favourably with those of developed countries, it is significantly less than those in other emerging countries, most notably in Asia.", "A reasonable benchmark for the evaluation of Africa's economic development, is the progress being made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development goals.", "The world's leaders

"There is little doubt that monetary policy has been successful in bringing down inflation in Africa.", "The rate of increase in prices has declined from an average of 14,3 percent in 2000 to 9,3

development challenges that confront the continent today, demand that both the quantity and efficiency of government expenditures are kept in check.", "While global FDI inflows declined 21 percent between 2001 and 2002, the inflow of FDI to Africa declined dramatically by more than 40 percent, according to the 2003 World Investment Report.", "In addition, Africa's share of foreign direct investment into developing countries has dropped from 25 percent in the early 1970s to just 5 percent in 2000.", "To compound matters further, an estimated 40 percent of Africa's own private savings

disappointment followed the failure of the recent World Trade Organisation talks at Cancun to reach agreement on the lowering of agricultural subsidies in developed countries.", "While, there is little doubt that increased trade between Africa and the developed world will increase Africa's chances of achieving it's economic and social objectives, it is imperative that attention is also given to the promotion of intra-Africa trade.", "Despite four decades of integration efforts, intra-African trade as a percentage of total trade remains low.", "For example, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimates that intra-African trade has increased only marginally from 8 percent in 1989 to 12 percent in 2002.", "It is therefore not surprising that current account deficits in many countries remain relatively high.", "The low level of African exports can be partly explained in terms of issues related to market access, inadequate infrastructure and other

single digit CPI inflation rates; ensure that the nominal value of public and publicly guaranteed debt, as a ratio of GDP, does not exceed 60 percent; ensure that the public budget deficit as a ratio of GDP does not exceed 5 percent; and have sustainable current account deficits - meaning 3 percent of GDP or less.", "In addition, Africa has embraced the New Partnership for Africa's Development
