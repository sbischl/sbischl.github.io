the issues and challenges that are confronting Central Banks in the 21st century.", "The Act provides greater clarity of the mandate for which the Central Bank is accountable for, ensures adequate powers to undertake these mandates, and ensures autonomy in achieving these mandates thus providing for the integrity and credibility of the decisions made by the Bank.", "This is further reinforced

in early 2007, Malaysia has seen the full impact of this crisis on our economy in the first half of this year.", "Today, we are very privileged to have with us Professor Dr. Takatoshi Ito, professor at the University of Tokyo and this year's holder of the Tun Ismail Ali Chair, to speak to us on the \"Comparison of the Financial Crises: Japan and Asia in 1997-1998 vs.", "The subject of this lecture is important as a greater understanding of the origins, the dynamics of financial crisis and the options for resolution is essential not only for its effective management but also for the lessons that can be drawn to prevent such future crisis.", "Given the severity and far reaching consequences of the current crisis, there has been a greater sense of urgency for the international

economy.", "The crisis was a defining moment for Bank Negara Malaysia .", "The Bank's efforts to sustain stability did not end when the Asian financial crisis abated, and when economic recovery was

reform of the financial sector.", "This included the aggressive development of the domestic financial markets and the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory oversight.", "This has been reinforced by a higher level of regional cooperation and collaboration.", "Therefore, it is not what we are currently doing to cope with this international financial crisis but the efforts that have been undertaken over several years that have ensured the resilience of our financial system during these most challenging of times.", "Over the course of these recent months, we have witnessed the introduction of massive fiscal stimulus packages, sweeping proposals for regulatory reforms and various unorthodox policy measures being introduced to stabilise and restore market confidence in the financial system.", "Whilst these measures were necessary and have contributed towards some stabilisation in global financial markets, more importantly is the long-term sustainability of this trend.", "With the urgency for immediate measures receding, it is hoped that it will give way to consensus on finding fundamental solutions that involve regulatory and institutional reforms both at the national and international levels.", "Today, we have the opportunity to listen to Professor Ito's lecture on the similarities and differences between the Asian Financial Crisis and the Japanese crisis
