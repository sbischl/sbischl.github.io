and the continuing approval by the Bangko Sentral of alternative mechanisms for sending money, such as SMS-based applications for remittances.", "The interconnection of the three networks facilitates greater accessibility as more ATMs can now serve the withdrawal needs of depositors.", "More importantly, it reduces the cost of transactions since it eliminated fees associated with the use of international \"switch\" to connect the three networks.", "Moving forward, our goal is to have further improvements so that we will have a remittance system based on transparency, efficiency, security and fair prices.", "The second challenge for our banks is to help in the national effort to encourage overseas workers and their beneficiaries to channel a higher percentage of their money to deposits and other productive activities possibly linking this to microfinance and small enterprise lending.", "As other speakers mentioned earlier, there is a full range of banking services that can be offered to overseas workers and their families.", "In line with its ongoing advocacy programs, the Bangko Sentral is undertaking a nationwide financial literacy campaign to help channel remittances to development activities and to promote a culture of saving among OFWs and their families.", "The financial literacy program emphasizes the importance of savings and introduces the participants to alternative opportunities for their remittances, such as placements in financial instruments and investments in business ventures.", "In summary, the Philippine central bank's initiatives to further improve the environment for overseas Filipino workers' (OFWs) remittance flows will continue to be anchored on five principles, namely: 1. enhancing transparency and promoting competition in the remittance market to lower remittance charges; 2. improving the country's payments and settlement systems to facilitate faster, safer and more efficient transfer of funds to beneficiaries; 3. improving access to financial services; 4. encouraging OFWs and their families to increase savings and investments; and 5. promoting advocacy programs to cultivate financial literacy among OFWs and their families.", "The BSP recognizes the valuable contribution of OFWs in expanding the foreign exchange available for meeting the economy's requirements, as well as the efforts of institutions that help improve the remittance environment, including remitting banks, private remittance companies, and other government agencies.", "We are therefore looking forward to a fruitful exchange in this meeting of the WSBI to help us provide better, faster and more cost-efficient services to our overseas workers who have helped empower our countries to grow at a healthy rate, on a more sustained basis.", "May you have a successful conference and a happy stay in our country.", "Thank you all and Mabuhay!"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Remittances", "Financial Literacy", "Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)", "Savings Banks", "Banking Services", "Payments and Settlement Systems", "Transparency", "Competition", "Efficiency", "Financial Inclusion"]}
