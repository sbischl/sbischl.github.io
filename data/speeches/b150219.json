possible reading of the historical runes.", "There is an alternative set of economic theories, and empirical facts, which paint a different picture of the genesis of growth either side of the Industrial Revolution.", "This alternative account might loosely be called \"endogenous\" growth theory.", "The factors driving growth are multiple, not singular.", "They are as much sociological as technological - skills and education, culture and cooperation, institutions and infrastructure.", "These factors are mutually-supporting, not exogenous and idiosyncratic.", "And they build in a cumulative, evolutionary fashion, rather than spontaneously combusting.", "One way of accommodating these broader factors is to widen the definition of \"capital\": physical capital (such as plant and machinery); human capital (such as skills and expertise); social capital (such as cooperation and trust); intellectual capital (such as ideas and technologies); and infrastructural capital (such as transport networks and legal systems).", "Growth results from the cumulative accretion of multiple sources of capital.", "To take a simple example, the success of the railways relied not just on the invention of the steam engine (intellectual capital), but on the materials (physical capital) and skills (human capital) to build locomotives and track.", "And to become a GPT, railways needed in addition a network (infrastructure capital) and the cooperation and trust of the general public (social capital).", "Looking at these multiple sources of capital, in turn, provides an account of the

in some countries higher.", "In other words, human capital accumulated at real pace prior to the Industrial Revolution.", "This skills-deepening provided one foundation on which other sources of growth-enriching capital were built - for example intellectual capital, the generation of ideas and innovation.", "On this interpretation, sociological transformation supported, perhaps preceded, technological transformation.", "Innovation was an earthly creation, not manna from heaven.", "Since the Industrial Revolution, levels of educational attainment have continued to rise.", "Since the Second World War, the number of years of schooling has risen rapidly (Chart 8), more than trebling in emerging markets and almost doubling in advanced economies.", "Latterly, that rise has been driven by increasing numbers of adults with degree-level (tertiary) qualifications.", "Human capital has widened and deepened.", "Empirical studies suggest higher educational standards may have accounted for as much as a fifth of US growth since 1950.26 Given the much larger scale of improvement in educational standards between the 16th and 18th centuries - the shift from an illiterate to a largely literate workforce - human capital accumulation seems likely to have played an even larger catalytic role in driving the Industrial Revolution.", "The picture is similar if we move from human to social capital.", "This is a more difficult concept to capture quantitatively.", "It embraces properties such as co-operation, reciprocity and trust within society.", "Although more elusive, these sources of social capital have been crucial to the success of nation states - for example, in supporting growth of trade.", "One measure of social capital used by sociologists is the incidence of violence or war in society.", "This is the limiting case of a lack of cooperation or trust within or across societies; it is the sociological equivalent of financial crisis.", "Chart 9 plots the incidence of murder (homicide) in Western European countries since 1300.", "It, too, tells a striking story.", "Violent crime fell dramatically between the 15th and 18th centuries, by a factor of around five.", "By the time of the Industrial Revolution, it had levelled-off.", "Rapid social capital accumulation provided a foundation for growth.", "Sociology nurtured technology.", "With some interruptions, notably the two World Wars of the 20th century, those trends towards lower levels of violence in society have continued to the present day.", "For example, war deaths have been falling secularly since the 1940s (Chart 10).", "This is consistent with a continuing accretion of social capital.", "Although hard to quantify, this too is likely to have provided a tailwind to growth in the modern era.", "Infrastructural and institutional capital are widely believed to have supported the growth process.", "England was the birth place of the Industrial Revolution.", "Its parents, arguably, were English institutions well into adolescence at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution: a parliamentary system from the 11th and 12th centuries; a legal and judicial system from the 12th and 13th centuries; a central bank, the Bank of England, from the end of 17th century.", "The government's role, as an institution in society, also rose rapidly prior to the Industrial Revolution.",

centuries government came of age: its share of spending rose 10 or 20-fold.", "Prior to the Industrial Revolution, institutions in general, and government in particular, became an increasingly important growth-enabler.", "Institutional and infrastructural capital has continued to accumulate in the period since.", "Since 1950, the number of countries operating with democratic institutions has risen from around 25 to almost 90.31 Legal systems globally have continued to improve in quality, and central bank numbers have continued to swell.", "Cross-country studies have found that the quality of these institutions and infrastructures is often key to driving growth.", "In what is perhaps the most comprehensive study of historical experience, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have taken the institutional argument one step further.", "For them, the lack of good institutions is the defining reason \"Why Nations Fail\".", "You do not need to go that far to think they have really mattered historically for living standards.", "The final ingredient in the growth recipe is intellectual capital, for some the source of the Industrial Revolution, Hargreaves, Arkwright, Watt and all.", "Yet it would be wrong to think innovation somehow began in the 18th century.", "From the windmill in the 12th century, the mechanical clock in the 13th, the cannon in the 14th, the printing press in the 15th, the postal service in the 16th and the telescope and microscope in the 17th, the innovation escalator was in service well before the Industrial Revolution, albeit stepped and sticky.", "Moreover, empirical evidence suggests a high degree of history-dependence, or hysteresis, in technology transfer.", "Patterns of technology adoption in 1500 AD are a remarkably good predictor of growth in 1800 AD.", "This suggests the technological seeds of the Industrial Revolution were sown well before Hargreaves, Arkwright and Watt arrived on the scene.", "Innovation is more earthly endeavour than heavenly intervention.", "Taken together, this suggests a much broader and richer set of foundations for growth.", "The seeds of the Industrial Revolution were sown much earlier, and scattered more widely, than a Neo-Classical account would suggest.", "And sociological transformation was at least as important as technological transformation in catalysing the lift-off in growth.", "Patience as a virtue Even if you accept this multi-faceted explanation of growth - part sociological, part technological - why did societies suddenly begin accumulating capital at particular points in history?", "What prompted that initial investment in skills, co-operation, institutions, infrastructure?", "One answer may lie inside our own heads.", "For those technological and sociological trends may, in turn, have caused a re-wiring of our brains.", "Underlying all investment decisions are what economists call \"rates of time preference\" - and what non-economists call patience: the willingness to defer gratification today for the benefit of tomorrow, to save rather than spend, stick rather than twist.", "One simple, economy-wide, measure of societal patience is found in the pattern of interest rates.", "Interest rates proxy society's willingness to save or stick.", "The less willing they are to do so - the greater their impatience - the higher the compensation they require.", "That compensation takes the form of a higher interest rate.", "So, for a given level of saving, an impatient society will have higher interest rates than a patient one.", "Chart 12 plots a measure of short and long-term interest rates back to 3000 BC.", "Though the data are patchy, they suggest interest rates fell secularly in the run-up to the Industrial Revolution, from double-digits to around 3%.", "Alternative interest rates, such as the rate of return on physical assets such as land, show a similar pattern.", "One interpretation of these trends is that they reflect society's evolving time preferences.", "In the run-up to the Industrial Revolution, society became more willing to wait than in the past.", "That, in turn, enabled saving, investment and ultimately growth.", "Patience was a virtue.", "But if society's time preferences were indeed shifting, that still begs the question why?", "Here, we can enlist some outside help.", "Experimental research over the past 50 years, by psychologists and neurologists, has taught us a great deal both about the determinants of patience and how it affects behaviour.", "This can perhaps provide insights into some of the historical drivers of a more patient, and hence higher growth, society.", "One important driver of patience is income and wealth.", "The lower income, the more impatient is human decision-making.", "Because surviving on limited means absorbs huge amounts of cognitive energy.", "It causes a neurological focus on the near-term.", "This myopic thinking has been found in everything from under-saving for retirement to over-borrowing from pay-day lenders.", "In developing countries, it may help explain poverty traps.", "During the Malthusian era, much of the population operated at close to subsistence income levels.", "If experimental evidence is any guide, that is likely to have generated an acute sense of societal short-termism.", "This may have manifested itself in, for example, a failure to invest in physical and human capital, retarding growth.", "Poverty and impatience would have been self-reinforcing, in a Malthusian poverty trap.", "The raising of incomes above subsistence levels which occurred after 1800 will have reversed that cycle.", "It will have boosted patience and laid the foundations for higher saving and investment and, ultimately, growth.", "In other words, after the Industrial Revolution patience may have created its own virtuous reward, endogenous growth style.", "Technological innovation has also been found to influence patience.", "The invention of the printing press by Guttenberg in around 1450 led to an explosion in book production.", "It is estimated that there were more books produced in the 50 years after

capital.", "More speculatively, they may also have re-wired our brains.", "Nicholas Carr argues that the changes brought about by the printing press, and other information media, may have re-shaped our minds.", "Books laid the foundations for \"deep reading\" and, through that, deeper and wider thinking.", "Technology was, quite literally, mind-bending.", "It has been argued that this re-wiring

construct a quasi-neurological explanation of much-earlier shifts in growth.", "The world's growth journey appears to have commenced, in earnest, around the time modern homo sapiens replaced Neanderthal man.", "Maybe that was no accident.", "Behind the physiological shift from the ridge brows of Neanderthal man to the flat foreheads of modern man may have been a more important neurological one.", "Flat foreheads allowed growth in the pre-frontal cortex region of the brain.", "Modern-day MRI scans tell us this region is responsible, among other things, for patience.", "What

at or above its historical average of 2-3%, in line with historical growth rates.", "But secular stagnation may imply a level much lower than in the past, possibly even negative.", "In monetary

yardstick for this time being different.", "Nonetheless, even with Moore's Law operating, it is only recently that the digital revolution may have reached critical velocity.", "Perhaps consistent with that, a number of transformative technologies have arrived on the scene recently, including in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3D printing, Big Data and the \"internet of things\".", "What is new is their widening application, as they have moved from inventions to GPTs.", "Economist Brian Arthur has a beautiful metaphor for describing this transition - the transition from a physical (or \"first\") economy to a digital (or \"second\") economy.", "He likens earlier industrial revolutions to the body developing its physiological or muscular system.", "By analogy, the economic system was defining and refining its motor skills, largely through investment in physical capital.", "The digital revolution is different.", "It is akin to the economic body developing its neurological or
