description and analysis that in the banking system the interests of depositors and borrowers are quite different.", "What we have been able to ensure is that competition reduces inefficiencies in the system and the gains are passed on to both the depositors and the borrowers.", "But, beyond this, there will always remain a tension between depositors who want higher returns on their savings and the borrowers who want lower interest rate on their loans.", "To sum up, banking sector reforms have brought in competition within the system, improved internal efficiency, reduced the lending rates significantly and broadened access to the middle class.", "While these results are encouraging, a lot more needs to be done and, therefore, we have spelled out the agenda for the second generation reforms in the financial sector covering the period 2005-2010."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance",
