time.", "In such a world, price signals from markets can help us to understand what adjustments need to be made.", "A liberalized, market-based regime is really the best that we have found for

responsible.", "This doesn't mean the books must be perfectly balanced each and every year.", "But it does mean that governments must maintain, and be committed to maintaining, a manageable

now developing their own local-currency markets.", "And their efforts are bearing fruit - the outstanding stock in these emerging economies' local bond markets now exceed $4 trillion US - a four-fold

personal observations which are based on 40 years experience in public finance, and as seen from two perspectives: both as a central banker, and before that, as a federal Finance department

in turn.", "In terms of macroeconomic policy, a government must build credibility with its own citizens first of all.", "Citizens need comfort that the government bonds that they hold will keep their value; that governments won't default on their obligations, or resort to large tax increases or inflation to ease the real burden of repayment.", "This initial hurdle of building credibility can be difficult to get over, as many emerging markets can attest to today.", "But once this hurdle has been cleared, a well-functioning, localcurrency government bond market brings with it the incentives for authorities to keep in place the sound policies that I mentioned in my introduction.", "Those policies should include monetary policy aimed at maintaining low, stable, and predictable inflation,

money markets, because it has parallels with the situation in which many emerging market economies now find themselves.", "In the 1950s, Canada was a relatively small, but very open economy that

primary emphasis at that time was on the development of a government treasury bill market, to assist in the more effective implementation and transmission of monetary policy.", "In addition, the Finance Department, with the central bank as its fiscal agent, wanted to promote the development of a well-functioning government bond market.", "This would help to provide the government with low-cost and stable financing.", "Moreover, Canada had also moved to a floating exchange rate, and so it was even more important that our debt be issued in the domestic currency.", "But the authorities also saw the financial system efficiency benefits that could flow from the development of a well-functioning government bond market.", "In particular, it would support development of, and access to, market-based credit for firms.", "The broader goal was to develop the foundation for an efficient domestic fixed-income market for private issuers.", "Of course, our markets have been continually evolving, and so we have had frequent consultations with market participants.", "These consultations have led to the development of a well-functioning and liquid market for government debt right across the yield curve.", "This market provides the pricing benchmarks for all other fixed-income instruments and their derivatives, thus facilitating market access for firms seeking debt financing.", "So what have we learned over the years?", "Well, experience has shown that in order to maintain an efficient, well-functioning local-currency debt market, it's helpful to focus on the

domestic financial system, the development of domesticcurrency markets is important to promote financial stability.", "Economies with a sound financial system can help to prevent shocks from spreading around the world.", "The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 really helped to illustrate how a crisis can spread among economies with weak financial systems, including, in some cases, serious mismatches in foreign currency assets and liabilities.", "This is why policy-makers around the world have been putting a lot of emphasis on improving domestic banking and financial systems.", "To develop a sound financial system requires several policy steps.", "The BIS Committee on the Global Financial System has outlined five key measures needed to develop deep and liquid bond markets.", "Allow me to list them.", "First, an economy must have a competitive markets structure; second, it must have liquid, benchmark bond issues; third, markets must be efficient, with low transactions costs; fourth, markets should be safe, sound and robust; and finally, it's important that there is a wide variety of market participants.", "I see from your program that these are issues that you will be talking about in more detail later this afternoon.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about how local-currency bond and money markets can help an economy, by giving the authorities incentives to follow good

remind ourselves of why it is we need strong, local-currency bond and money markets.", "Speaking generally, the steps that Canada took in the past to develop its local-currency bond and money markets be applicable to today's world, and to the various emerging market economies that are now trying to find their own path.", "But what is certain is that the original principles that guided us in
