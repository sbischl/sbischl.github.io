rebound At this time last year, Mexico's economy was deteriorating.", "Today, an incipient upswing is underway.", "Specifically, in the second quarter, Mexico's economy posted vigorous growth, similar

the business community's more positive answer to the survey question of whether or not this is the right moment to invest.", "Consensus analysts' point forecasts fall within these intervals.", "The balance of risks for the growth scenario is to the upside.", "The possibility of higher-thananticipated economic expansion in the United States, as well as more constructive investment sentiment stemming from progress in the implementation of structural reforms, contributes to this assessment.", "Financial market developments Since February, international financial market volatility has

implied downward shifts for Mexico's yield curve, together with the long end of the U.S. curve.", "Intermittent breaks in the calm since the end of July reflect the swinging of market expectations for

Mexico's annual headline inflation breached the upper limit of the variability interval around the central bank's permanent target of 3 percent.", "This development, which has surpassed market expectations, reflected pressures in the core component, especially goods prices, as well as the noncore component, driven particularly by livestock prices.", "The possible persistence of these adverse factors makes it likely that inflation will remain above or near 4 percent during the second half of the year.", "Some conditions should contribute to a decrease in inflation next year, such as base effects from the 2014 fiscal reform, lower rises in government-administered gasoline prices, and a possible drop in some telephony charges due to new regulations.", "However, the impact should be properly assessed.", "For example, the new gasoline price policy does not mean the absence of annual pressure from this front during the year.", "The balance of inflation risks appears to be to the upside due to the following.", "First, proposals are being considered for substantial rises in minimum wages, which could generate inertia in inflation and second-round effects in the price-formation process.", "Second, the possibility of unforeseen additional pressures in agricultural prices persists.", "Historically, this component has posted a higher average and more volatile annual change than that of energy and government-administered prices.", "Third, the risk of bouts of high financial volatility remains, and this could push prices higher through the exchange rate channel.", "The upside risks are especially significant as annual headline inflation will probably surpass 4 percent most of this year, and analysts' inflation expectations for all time frames remain above the permanent target.", "These challenges merit careful monitoring.", "I would like to add a few comments on possible minimum wage hikes in Mexico.", "Minimum wages are a feature common to most countries, and Mexico is no exception, with the level set by a national commission for all jurisdictions.", "What is particular to our country is a notable deterioration of this indicator in the 1980s and 1990s due to high and unstable inflation.", "This process yielded lower purchasing power for all salaries and underscores the vital necessity of protecting the significant ground gained in the last decade in the battle to control inflation, and of consolidating this progress.", "What effects would minimum wage hikes have in Mexico?", "The economic literature on competitive labor markets suggests that rises in real minimum wages can hurt employment and training, especially of young and unskilled laborers, and promote informality.", "Also, there may be some pass-through from these increases to prices of final goods and services.", "The degree of these and other impacts remains an empirical issue.", "In the case of Mexico, these effects could be material, for at least two reasons.", "First, negotiations of private-sector contractual salaries have tended to take into account minimumwage revisions as a floor reference, although the two are not automatically tied.", "The wage contagion could reflect partly a substitution effect away from less-skilled workers, a phenomenon observed in many countries.", "Second, the minimum wage serves as an index for myriad legal purposes, including fines, tax exemptions, public pensions, government-sponsored mortgages, and many private contracts.", "Wage contagion and indexation would broaden the possible negative real effects on the economy.", "Furthermore, significant minimum wage hikes may contaminate the process of price formation.", "These adjustments could trigger a chain reaction on inflation expectations, complicating the challenges for the Bank of Mexico in getting inflation to converge to its permanent target.", "To handle the risk from indexation, complicated legal changes and cumbersome contract revisions would be called

details.", "The quality of implementation is of the utmost importance for the transformations to yield their expected benefits.", "Reforms are currently in the implementation stage.", "Some of the changes have come into effect with the mere publication of the new laws, such as the prohibition of bundled sales of products in the financial sector.", "Others imply specific actions already contemplated.", "For example, in education, the first generalized test is in place to qualify a teacher to receive an elementary school post, breaking with a long tradition in which new graduates from teaching schools were automatically hired.", "In the financial sector, a newly established resolution scheme is being applied to the case of a small bank without incident.", "In telecommunications, the arrival of new competitors, drawn by a changed set of rules and conditions in the marketplace, sets the stage for a possible shakeup.", "Auctions for nationwide television licenses are in the offing.", "Much interest is focused on the energy reform.", "Geographical areas for oil and gas exploration and production have already been allocated to Pemex, and the first round of auctions for the private sector will take place early next year.", "These opportunities are generating enthusiasm in the private sector and should draw significant investment from both domestic and foreign companies.", "Greater competition, in turn, should boost total factor productivity and potential GDP growth in the medium term.", "To take full advantage of this situation, Mexico needs to complement

infrastructure, and enhancing public security.", "Concluding remarks Mexico has seen an incipient economic upturn this year, driven by stronger external demand and higher domestic spending.", "The panorama is favorable given more consistent U.S. economic performance and Mexican structural reforms in the first stages of implementation.", "Mexico's economy has benefited from the continuation of

that may generate additional price pressures are risks that must be carefully watched in order to make convergence to the permanent inflation target a reality.", "Current discussions on recovering the real value of the minimum wage underscore the need to keep the upper hand in the fight against inflation.", "Finally, progress on structural reform is encouraging, but implementation over time must be adequate for expected benefits to fully materialize."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
