the country's banking system, the Bank of Thailand also fosters development of the financial system to bring about growth.", "I would now like to lead you through the details of our role in growth and hope that by the end of our talk you will have gained firmer belief that Thailand's policy makers are committed to the country's long-term growth.", "My talk today will cover the two roles that the

in the long term.", "Secondly, I will address growth opportunities available to Thailand and the Bank of Thailand's role in developing the financial structure that enables the capture of these opportunities.", "Due to necessity as well as design, several structural changes are now underway in Thailand, and the Bank of Thailand aims to facilitate the transformation of these changes into sustainable long-term growth.", "Ladies and gentlemen, When businesses go about their daily activity, they not only produce goods for consumption today, but they also innovate and improve their tools of trade in order to produce more and newer goods in the future.", "When the economy enters a long slump, these improvements are foregone and future growth potential is diminished, a situation known as hysteresis.", "Therefore a smooth growth path is desirable for sustainable growth.", "This brings us to the first role of the central bank in this talk, safeguarding stability and balance in the economy.", "In particular, the Bank of Thailand monitors three facets of stability: growth stability, price stability, and financial stability.", "In terms of growth stability, we have been on the low end of the balance.", "We observe Thailand's average growth to be near zero in the past three quarters, and currently we are still well below the long-term trend.", "The underperformance was contributed to by political uncertainty and drawdown from earlier accelerated spending encouraged by previous government policies.", "The long stretch of low growth calls for the central bank to step

Thailand has learned from our own experience with a financial crisis as well as others' and has been vigilantly monitoring indicators of risk to financial stability in the economy, and has policies developed especially to ensure financial stability.", "Conducting policy through the use of interest rate alone may not be sufficient to take care of financial imbalance.", "In addition to monetary policy, which sometimes is too blunt to optimally take care of financial stability, we have adopted macroprudential tools since 2002 and employed them to help us cover and specifically target areas of the financial system.", "For example, we monitor excessive credit card loans to sub-par debtors, excessive foreign exchange speculation, and formation of a real estate bubble.", "Apart from abovementioned policies, the managed float exchange rate regime helps maintain stability in capital flows.", "Under this regime, Thai Baht is allowed to move in line with the market forces but gives the central bank ability to influence the exchange rate in the time of excessive volatility.", "All the mentioned policies have helped to keep the current economy in good balance.", "Today, capital

which could lead to capital flow volatility in Thailand.", "Even with headwind from the Fed's action of hiking policy interest rate, we anticipate only limited impact on overall Thai economy as the market has already gradually priced in the Fed's stance since last year.", "Additionally, our reserves remain high, allowing the economy to be cushioned from the possible outflows of capital.", "Moreover our managed float exchange rate regime automatically stabilizes against possible volatility.", "At the same time, household debt, currently at 83% of GDP, requires a long-term solution.", "While its effect so far remains contained, its risk cannot be ignored.", "Over the recent years, the Bank of Thailand has built awareness of this risk in the public which has contributed to the natural adjustment of the market and therefore the slowdown of household debt accumulation.", "Going forward, the Bank is proposing a national agenda to the government to promote financial literacy and discipline to ensure long-term stability in line with our own ongoing financial awareness projects.", "I have now talked about the central bank's commitment to growth, price, and financial stability in order to support sustainable growth.", "Now that we are in recovery, minding the future risks to financial and price stability, and being in possession of stabilization tools tested and refined over time, the Monetary Policy Committee will carefully weigh the tradeoff between short-term growth and long-term risks and ensure that the economy will have enough financial ease to recover

efficient production to support businesses at home.", "Seeing these chances, the government has given priority to infrastructure by endorsing investment plans, especially in railways and roads, to reduce transportation costs, and setting up Special Economic Zones at five locations along our border to reap the benefit from our strategic location as a gateway to other ASEAN countries.", "On the side of the Bank of Thailand, we facilitate the ease of doing business through the Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan so that businesses can benefit from this opportunity.", "The progress can

industries.", "There are also SMEs who have the capability to produce high value added products by creating their own innovation such as the seasoning packages you see in Asian grocery stores here.",

that has outstanding growth in exports since launch.", "In 2004, the Bank of Thailand launched the Financial Master Plan which aims to increase efficiency and financial access by promoting competition in the market.", "Since implementation, we have observed the improvement in Thailand's financial infrastructure from reduced cost-to-income of commercial banks and particularly from SMEs' greater financial access.", "The cost of raising funds in Thailand has been reduced through the welldeveloped financial market since more players are allowed to offer variety of financial products.", "Moreover, the increasing in competition among commercial banks provides higher incentive for them to serve a wider range of customers, especially SMEs, who once have limited access to raise funds and

its position as the play maker to assist the private sector to reach the goal of achieving growth potential.", "The resilience of the Thai economy 1.", "Credible macroeconomic policies A key strength

coordination among public agencies.", "- Monetary Policy: Under a flexible inflation targeting framework, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cautiously weighs overall stability against downside risks to growth.", "In the absence of a fullyfunctioning fiscal authority prior to changes in the political situation, the MPC stepped up and reduced the policy rate to support the economy.", "- Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy formulation and public debt management are guided by explicit fiscal rules, which provide checks and balance against potential challenges to fiscal discipline from offbudget
