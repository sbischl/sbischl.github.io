past.", "But in its place has emerged a different scourge static or lower pay and rising income insecurity.", "Job insecurity at the end of the 20th century has given way to income insecurity at the start of the 21st.", "This insecurity is an important part of the explanation for recent patterns in jobs and pay.", "- The framework most often used by macro-economists to explain pay and jobs is the Phillips curve the negative relationship between pay growth and the stock of unemployment.", "Despite reports of its demise, there is still reasonably clear empirical evidence of a Phillips curve in labour market data, once allowance is made for a possible downwards shift in the NAIRU and/or slope of the Phillips curve.", "An alternative, complementary, lens on the labour market comes from looking at flows of workers between jobs, rather than stocks of unemployed.", "There is a large literature studying the process by which people search for work and are matched into jobs.", "There is empirical evidence that job-to-job flows the velocity of circulation in the labour market can play a significant role in explaining wage growth.", "When studying labour market flows, a \"jobs ladder\" pattern of behaviour has often been found.", "In a growing economy, workers move between jobs by climbing a ladder of opportunities based on job characteristics such as relative rates of pay and firm productivity.", "The tighter the jobs market, the harder it is for companies to fill vacancies, the greater their incentive to offer workers higher-paid positions and the stronger the incentives among workers to move into these positions.,16 More productive firms are better able to offer higher rates of pay.", "This means more productive firms are also the ones most likely to expand, as they bid-away workers with higher pay offers.", "Less productive firms, by contrast, are unable to pay-up and are more likely lose workers and shrink.", "As workers climb the pay and productivity ladder, we would thus expect to see simultaneously higher levels of job moves, and higher rates of pay and productivity growth.", "Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2016) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2018).",

a slowdown.", "Then, rates of hiring fall and rates of job transition slow.", "Workers are either forced off the jobs ladder entirely (\"unemployment\") or, in coordination with employers, the labour market outcome results in them moving to a lower rung of the pay and productivity ladder (\"under-employment\").", "Lower-productivity firms expand while higher-productivity firms shrink.", "The result is slower rates of job move and lower rates of pay and productivity growth.", "One of the attractions of this approach is that it explains the velocity of circulation in the labour market, pay and productivity growth as a single, simultaneous process as workers traverse the jobs ladder.", "We do not need to rely on unexplained shocks to productivity to explain pay.", "Rather, it is behaviour by companies and workers which generates simultaneous movements in pay and productivity.", "So how useful is this framework when characterising recent behaviour in the UK labour market?", "At a high level, this story fits the UK facts.", "Chart 13 plots job-to-job flows in the UK over recent decades.", "It displays a pro-cyclical pattern, with job moves picking up during a recovery and falling during a recession.", "From their low point in 2010, job-to-job flows in the UK have picked up as the labour market has tightened.", "Hiring and quit rates among companies are also pro-cyclical, as we would expect.", "More than that, the degree of pro-cyclicality in hiring is strongest, and in firing is weakest, among the medium and large firms.", "To the extent size is a proxy for productivity, this is also as we would expect.", "During expansions, more productive firms hire more, and lose fewer, of their workers than less productive firms (Charts 14a and 14b).", "Other patterns in the data less obviously fit the facts, however.", "Despite jobs flows picking up, pay growth has until reasonably recently remained slow and low.", "Meanwhile, productivity growth has remained For example, Bernard et al (2014) and Wales et al (2018).", "stubbornly subdued despite a seven-year jobs recovery.", "So has the jobs ladder broken?", "Have its rungs been removed?", "To understand these developments, it is useful to break the decade down into phases.", "Notes: Charts show four-quarter moving average of hire and quit rates.", "(a) Descending the Jobs Ladder The global financial crisis generated a sharp fall in output.", "Given that fall, the subsequent rise in unemployment was more modest than expected.", "By comparison, in the early 1990s recession output fell by around 2% peak-to-trough, while the unemployment rate increased by over 2.5 percentage points.", "Put differently, in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, unemployment rose by less than was expected by most mainstream forecasters, including the Bank.", "Chart 15 shows Bank forecasts for unemployment in early-2009 and early-2010.", "Having expected unemployment to peak at over 10.5%, the eventual peak of 8.5% was reached in late-2011.", "More recently, the \"Okun's Law\" relationship appears to have steepened as weak productivity growth since the crisis has seen unemployment fall sharply since 2012 despite more modest GDP growth (Chart 16).", "Notes: Chart shows calendar year GDP growth plotted against annual percentage point change in calendar year average unemployment rate.", "A different way still of illustrating, and explaining, these developments comes from looking at job moves.", "As the crisis struck, job-to-job movements fell.", "Instead of moving between jobs, workers instead transitioned into unemployment.", "But these transition rates into unemployment rose by less than in previous recessions.", "Workers and their employers bargained to remain on the jobs ladder rather than jumping-off.", "Remaining on the ladder did, however, come at a cost in terms of pay.", "For workers staying in the same job this meant accepting pay freezes, with the fraction of workers accepting these rising sharply during the crisis (Chart 17a).", "For workers moving, this meant moving down the jobs ladder by accepting lower-paying jobs at lower-productivity firms: the fraction of switchers taking pay cuts spiked during the crisis (Chart 17b).", "At the time of the global financial crisis, then, workers and their employers were faced with a stark outcome of job insecurity (jumping off the ladder) or income insecurity (stepping down the ladder).", "Unlike in previous recessions, most chose the latter path.", "The result was lower-than-expected unemployment, but weaker pay and productivity growth.", "Notes: Chart shows percentage of workers either in current job or moving job who faced nominal pay cuts or freezes in a given year.", "Notes: Median hourly pay.", "(b) Climbing the Jobs Ladder As the economy recovered after the crisis, so did aggregate jobs growth.", "In response, workers began to climb the jobs ladder, with transition rates between jobs rising.", "We would expect this to have then boosted aggregate pay and productivity, as workers rotated into higher-paying, more productive firms.", "In practice, this process appears to have been sluggish for pay and to have stalled for productivity.", "There appear to have been two effects at play in slowing the rate of climb up the jobs ladder.", "First, although the rate of jobs transition picked up, it did so only slowly, especially given the degree of underlying strength in the jobs market.", "Despite picking up, the velocity of circulation in the labour market has remained relatively subdued in the face of the biggest jobs bonanza since the Second World War.", "Job-to-job transition rates have only just reached their pre-crisis levels after seven years (Chart 13).", "This relatively subdued pattern is even more striking if we compare transition rates with the degree of tightness in the labour market, defined by the V/U ratio (Chart 19).", "This suggests job-to-job transitions have not really picked-up at all over recent years, when measured relative to the strength of the jobs market.", "What explains these subdued rates of job transition?", "A strong candidate is that 21st century scourge, income insecurity.", "The crisis scarred risk appetite.", "Risk-aversion discourages workers from moving to reach higher rungs up the jobs ladder.", "It also discourages companies from offering workers those higher-rung positions.", "Risk scarring slows the velocity of circulation in the jobs market and hence pay and productivity growth.", "One rationale for risk-aversion in moving to higher paid jobs at a different firm could be so-called \"last-in-first-out\" workers are mostly likely to lose their jobs in the event of redundancies.", "This risk-aversion has not been confined to those switching jobs; it has also affected those staying put.", "A reluctance to move reduces these bargaining power, weighing on their pay.", "Put differently, if companies are less fearful of workers being poached, for a given degree of the strength in the jobs market, they will feel less need to pay-up to retain those workers.", "There is evidence of this behaviour in the differential pay growth of stickers and switchers recently (Chart 20).", "Switchers have consistently experienced higher rates of pay growth than stickers, as we would expect.", "But it is striking how this differential has widened as the labour market has tightened over recent years, with movers securing pay increases of 7-9%, while stickers' has until recently flat-lined at 2-21\u20442%.", "(c) Rungs on the Jobs Ladder The second dynamic at work is that even those climbing the ladder have tended to do so at a less rapid pace than in the past.", "Or, put differently, the rungs in the jobs ladder have been closer together.", "This, too, may have reflected workers' unwillingness to move occupation, industry or geography at a time of increased income insecurity.", "The Resolution Foundation has recently looked at rates of movement between UK regions.", "They find that rates of geographic mobility people taking a new job in a different region has been lower since the crisis than in the preceding period.", "Their analysis finds that this reduction in mobility is driven by the young and, in particular, young graduates.", "Graduates under the age of 35 were close to 6 times more likely to move region and employer than non-graduates in the 1990s but are now just 3 times more likely.", "And mobility has decreased for both groups.", "Charts 21 and 22 look at rates of worker transition between different industries and occupations.", "These moves are grouped into \"rungs\" on the ladder, where the rungs for the 9-rung occupation ladder are ordered by the standard ONS classification, which itself reflects differences in skills used within each occupational group.", "For the 21-rung industry ladder, the rungs are ordered by the mean hourly gross pay of workers within each industry, across the whole sample period.", "The blue zone defines zero rung movements.", "The red zone defines large upward rung movements and the grey zone large downwards movements.", "Notes: Chart shows percentage of jobs moves based on extent of upward or downward movement along the industry job ladder.", "Notes: Chart shows percentage of jobs moves based on extent of upward or downward movement along the occupational job ladder.", "During the crisis, we would expect a larger number of moves down the industry and occupational ladder.", "There is some evidence of that, with the lower tail (grey zone) fattening and the upper tail (red zone) thinning a little.", "Thereafter, as the jobs market recovered, we would expect a fattening of the upper tail (red zone) and a thinning of the lower (grey and blue) zones.", "There is no real evidence of that.", "The zone of small rung movements has remained fairly static.", "We get a similar story if we look at the company destination for jobs moves, ranked by productivity.", "We would expect to see workers move down the productivity ladder during downturns and to rescale that ladder during upturns.", "The first part of that story is borne out in the data.", "Rates of productivity gain from a job switch fell from around 8% pre-crisis to around 3% afterwards.", "More surprising is that there has been no recovery in these rates of productivity gain during the subsequent jobs recovery (Chart 23).", "The rungs in the jobs ladder have had a smaller productivity spacing than in the past.", "Notes: Chart shows percentage difference in productivity between new firm and old firm with the median workers moves between firms.", "Summing up, then, a strong jobs recovery has not resulted in workers vigorously re-climbing the jobs ladder.", "Both their willingness to climb, and the pace of this climb, has been subdued relative to the strength and tightness of the jobs market.", "Post-crisis risk aversion, and changes in the nature of work, may have increased insecurities and dimmed workers' appetite for a vertiginous career climb or indeed any climb.", "The result has been subdued rates of pay and, in particular, productivity growth.", "Just recently, some of these patterns in pay, if not productivity, have begun to reverse themselves.", "Nominal being in the \"low 2s\" pay growth has been going slowly through the gears over the past few years, from three the \"high 2s\" 18 months ago to having a \"3\" in front of it now.", "Private regular pay growth is currently running at 3.7% year on year.", "The reasons for this rise can also be found, to some extent, in job dynamics.", "There is only modest evidence that those moving position are climbing the ladder any faster.", "But it is notable that, as the labour market has tightened and skill shortages have emerged, we have seen pay growth among stickers beginning to rise after a long period of tranquillity.", "In other words, employers' increased appetite to retain staff, and employees' increased willingness to consider moving, appears now to be affecting pay.", "This might also help explain why, although pay has picked up (as stickers are rewarded not to move), there is little sign so far of productivity following suit (as job moves towards higher-productivity firms have not picked-up).", "With productivity subdued alongside higher pay, growth in annual unit wage costs is now running at elevated levels of over 2 1\u20442% year on year.", "That is in excess of levels consistent with meeting the Bank's inflation target and begs a question about the stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn.", "Bank of England estimate using monthly AWE, employment and monthly GVA.", "A Polarised Economy At present, we are being fed a rich daily diet of news about polarisation in our politics and societies, globally and nationally.", "Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that there are also signs of polarity when it comes to the prospective fortunes of our economies, globally and nationally.", "Certainly, downside risks to the global and UK economy have increased through this year.", "At the global level, a key current source of risk is trade.", "For a 60-year period after the Second World War, barriers to trade were significantly and systematically dismantled, courtesy of multilateral trade liberalisation initiatives.", "As a result, global tariffs have fallen by two-thirds since the early 1990s (Chart 25).", "The dismantling of trade barriers ushered in a halcyon period of rising trade peace and prosperity.", "Global goods trade volumes grew, on average, by 10% per year between 1950 and 2008.", "Global supply chains lengthened and deepened.", "A post-War consensus forged global cooperation in trade, finance and security, embedded and embodied in the Bretton Woods institutions which this year celebrate their 75th birthday.", "Some of the observed decline in tariffs is also attributable to the General System of Preferences (GSP) and other unilateral preferential treatment schemes.", "Notes: Weighted global mean of all applied tariffs across all products.", "Recently, that tide of cooperation, including on trade, has shown signs of turning - what Mark Carney recently called a \"sea change\".", "After a prolonged period of peace, trade wars are now being waged: tariffs have been introduced on over $200 billion of bilateral goods trade between the US and China; further US-China tariffs are threatened; and there are ongoing trade tensions between the US and Mexico and the US and Europe.", "These developments are reverberating around global financial markets and among companies.", "Among global investors, trade wars have risen to the top of their worry lists.", "Negative trade news has weighed on global equity and corporate bond prices and government bond yields, as investors have sought safety.",

tensions are also taking their toll on companies' sentiment and activity.", "Global goods trade has slowed (Chart 27).", "But the weakening has been even more striking in business surveys of sentiment, across the world's major trading manufacturing and export orders.", "This weakening has been broadly-based economies, with simultaneous falls in sentiment across the United States, Asia,

appear to have been large relative to the modest announced tariff increases.", "Based on the higher trade tariffs announced so far, and using standard trade models, we would expect a negative impact on global growth of a few tens of basis points.", "The adjustments in asset prices and business survey responses have been multiples of that.", "One way of beginning to make sense of this puzzle comes from casting our minds back a decade.", "Back then, we also saw outsized responses in global asset and output markets following a modestly-sized shock a collapse in the US sub-prime market which at the time accounted for less than 1% of global wealth.", "This collapse prompted the sharpest fall in global output and asset prices since the 1930s.", "We now have a much better sense of why: closely

the course expected by companies in Chart 30.", "Assume also, in that event, that monetary policy followed a simple Taylor Rule and that inflation was unaffected.", "These are clearly very stylised assumptions.", "Nonetheless, on those assumptions, a Taylor Rule would suggest interest rates would need to be cut sharply to their zero bound, to cushion the hit to growth.", "If we do the same thought-experiment under the scenario, again using a simple Taylor Rule, we get instead an upwards-sloped trajectory for expected interest rates, on average 25-50 basis points higher than the slightly upward-sloped market path for interest rates prevailing in May.", "Clearly, these are two very different interest rate trajectories, reflecting two quite different Brexit economic outcomes.", "In the event of a 'deal', upward pressure on demand would also likely be accompanied with a stronger exchange rate, so the impact on inflation is ambiguous.", "My MPC colleague, Jan Vlieghe, made a similar point in his recent speech (Vlieghe (2019)).", "The market-implied path for interest rates is a probability-weighted mix of these two paths.", "With a 30% probability of \"no deal\", this expected path would have interest rates falling in the near term before rising gently thereafter.", "Despite our scenarios being highly stylised and simplified, this expected path broadly mirrors the current market yield curve.", "In practice, as the MPC has emphasised, the actual path of interest rates in the event of either Brexit outcome would never be automatic; it will depend on the response of demand, supply and the exchange rate to these outcomes.", "This is impossible to predict in advance.", "If a \"no deal\" were to lead to a sharp fall in sterling and a sharp rise in inflation

experience, or recent historical experience, to the current stance of UK monetary policy.", "That is dangerous when the starting point for the UK economy, and the shocks to which it is potentially subject to, are very different to our the UK's own recent overseas counterparts or indeed past.", "Since the start of the year, UK short-term interest rates have moved in lockstep with those in the major economies, notably the US and the euro area.", "The correlation of daily changes between them has been around 0.7, a little above its historical average.", "Common exposures to a slowing global trade cycle can explain some, if not all, of this correlation.", "But what stands out, for me, are the differences as much as the similarities between the UK, US and euro-area economies.", "Chart 32

percentage points looser than in the US.", "There may well be good grounds for these international differences for example, differing levels of neutral real rates and different natural unemployment rates.", "Nonetheless, the very different starting positions of the economy and monetary policy should give us cause to pause before simply assuming central banks should be moving synchronously, even when faced by a common global shock.", "One reason why financial markets might be over-extrapolating international experience is because, at least since the crisis, monetary policy internationally has borne most of the burden of supporting growth in \"the only game in town\".", "Over that period, central banks have often been I believe that game made economic sense.", "The crisis led to a large gap opening-up between aggregate demand and supply in the economy.", "Pump-priming aggregate demand back towards aggregate supply, through accommodative monetary policy, was the right policy response.", "And this monetary medicine, as best we can tell, worked.", "In the UK and US, aggregate demand is now back in line with supply.", "And in the euro area and Japan, the output gap has shrunk materially.", "Today, however, the conjunctural starting position for most advanced economies is very different than a decade ago.", "With the output gap closed in the UK, economic growth and pay rises in future can no longer rely on monetary policy pump-priming demand.", "It will instead require a lasting expansion in supply potential, if capacity constraints are not to bite and inflationary pressures are not to snuff out pay rises.", "It is not just the economic starting point that differs, now versus a decade ago.", "So too do the potential shocks.", "A decade ago, the world faced a sharp shock to aggregate demand courtesy of the global financial crisis.", "This opened-up yawning output gaps and fed fears of the scourge of 1930s-style mass unemployment returning.", "Monetary policy responded with a force never previously seen in history.", "Today, the most likely shocks or downside risks to the economy are very different in their source and impact.", "They arise from factors such as global trade wars and Brexit.", "These shocks are different in their duration more slow-burn than spontaneous conflagration.", "And they are radically different in their source, as they hit the supply potential of the economy, as much as its demand side.", "Consider the effects of Brexit uncertainty on the UK economy.", "By far the largest effects have been on companies'

are large negative shocks to the economy's supply-side potential.", "They are hits that monetary policy is not itself well-placed to mitigate.", "There is a risk of people normalising the deviance in monetary policy since the crisis.", "Around a quarter of adults in the UK working population have never experienced Bank Rate above 1% in their adult lives.", "In these changed circumstances compared with a decade ago, it is important that monetary policy is not a prisoner of its past, that the monetary cavalry are not called at the first whiff of grapeshot, that a dependency culture around monetary policy is not allowed to develop.", "A decade ago, central banks were the only game in town and monetary medicine was the right prescription.", "A decade on, the game has changed and so too
