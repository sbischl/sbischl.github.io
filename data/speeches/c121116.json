at least not ones that operate in any form other than that of a very tightly regulated utility.", "The second question is the more interesting one.", "Is the current approach of the official sector to ending TBTF the right one?", "I'd characterize this approach as reducing the incentives for firms to operate with a large systemic footprint, reducing the likelihood of them failing, and lowering the cost to society when they do fail.", "Or would it be better to take the more direct, but less nuanced approach advocated by some and simply break up the most systemically important firms into smaller or simpler pieces in the hope that what emerges is no longer systemic and too big to fail?1 As I will explain tonight, I believe we should continue to press forward on the first path.", "But, if we fail to reach our destination by this route, then a blunter approach may yet prove necessary.", "As always, my views may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System.", "What is the too-big-to-fail problem?", "The root cause of \"too big to fail\" is the fact that in our financial system as it exists today, the failure of large complex financial firms generate large, undesirable externalities.", "These include disruption of the stability of the financial system and its ability to provide credit and other essential financial services to households and businesses.", "When this happens, not only is the financial sector disrupted, but its troubles cascade over into the real economy.", "There are negative externalities associated with the failure of any financial firm, but these are disproportionately high in the case of large, complex and interconnected firms.", "Although the moniker is \"too big to fail\", the magnitude of these externalities does not depend simply on size.", "The size of the externalities also depends on the particular mix of business activities and the degree of interconnectedness with the rest of the financial industry.", "One important element is the importance of the services the firm provides to the broader financial system and the economy and the ease with which customers can move their business to other providers.", "Another is the extent to which the firm's structure and activities create the potential for contagion - that is, direct losses for counterparties, fire sales of assets held by other leveraged financial institutions, or loss of confidence that might precipitate runs on other firms with similar business models.", "The presence of large negative externalities creates a dilemma for policymakers when such firms are in danger of failing, particularly if the wider financial system is also under stress at the same moment.", "At that point in time, the expected costs to society of failure are very large compared to the short-run costs from providing the extraordinary liquidity support, capital or other emergency assistance necessary to prevent catastrophic failure.", "The market's belief that a TBTF firm is more likely to be rescued in the event of distress than other firms weakens the degree of market discipline exerted by capital providers and counterparties.", "This reduces the firm's cost of funds and incents the firm to take more risk than would be the case if there were no prospect of rescue and funding costs were higher.", "The fact that firms deemed by the market to be TBTF enjoy an artificial subsidy in the form of lower funding costs distorts competition to the detriment of smaller, less complex firms.", "This advantage, in turn, creates an unfortunate incentive for firms to get even larger and more complex.", "The funding benefit of being seen to be TBTF causes the financial system to become artificially skewed toward larger and more complex firms -

all of which created intense competitive pressures to expand in order to gain economies of scale and scope.", "In commercial banking, consolidation occurred at a rapid pace.", "For example, Bank of America was the outgrowth of over 160 different mergers, which pushed up the size of the original acquirer from $23 billion of assets in 1980 to $2.2 trillion today.", "In the securities industry, some partnerships became public companies, in part, so that they could more easily obtain the capital needed to expand rapidly.", "For example, when Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, it had about 15,000 employees and $250 billion of assets.", "Just eight years later, the firm had expanded to 35,000 employees and $1.1 trillion of assets.", "In the mid-1990s, the top five banks in the United States had total assets of $1 trillion or about 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).", "The top securities firms had total assets of $718 billion, or about 9 percent of GDP.", "Similarly, the top securities firms accounted for $3.8 trillion, or about 27 percent of GDP.", "In addition, the firms' off-balance-sheet exposures rose sharply.", "Second, the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest financial firms increased markedly.", "Factors behind this include the adoption of a universal banking model by some commercial bank holding companies and the rapid growth of trading businesses, especially the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market.", "In the early 1980s, there were no true U.S. \"universal banks\" that combined traditional commercial banking with capital markets and underwriting activities.", "By 2007, there were several operating in the United States, including Citigroup, J.P.

Morgan absorbed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and its assets grew from $1.5 trillion in 2007 to $2.3 trillion today; Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia and its assets increased from $575 billion in 2007 to $1.3 trillion today; and Bank of America purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, increasing its assets from $1.7 trillion in 2007 to $2.2 trillion today.", "This, of course, made the surviving firms even bigger and more complex.", "When the smoke had cleared, the situation was clearly untenable.", "The experience of the crisis increased the advantage from being perceived as TBTF, and, thus, strengthened the incentives to become bigger, more complex, and interconnected.", "The Dodd Frank Act (DFA) set out to end TBTF.", "One means was by eliminating the Federal Reserve's discretion to provide emergency financial support through a program open only to a single financial institution, and, in general, raising the bar for broader-based emergency interventions under section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act.", "But, as the DFA recognized, simply tying the Fed's hands on intervention is insufficient.", "It does not reduce the cost to society from the failure of a large and complex firm.", "In order for the non-intervention strategy to be both fully credible and consistent with the public interest, we need to tackle the underlying externalities and incentive problems that give rise to TBTF in the first place.", "Tackling too big to fail As I see it, solving the TBTF problem requires working on a number of different margins.", "These include measures that are firm-specific and those that address the structure of the financial system more broadly.", "One set of measures works to reduce the incentives for excessive risk-taking and to lower the probability that large financial firms fail or come close to failure.", "Another set lessens the disruption to the financial system and hence the cost their failure imposes on the broader economy and society as a whole.", "Along with measures that penalize characteristics associated with the negative externalities from failure, these changes work against the incentive to be too big to fail.", "Policy measures that alter incentives and reduce the probability of distress A number of steps have already been taken that reduce the probability of failure.", "For example, there has already been considerable progress in forcing firms to bolster their capital and liquidity resources.", "On the capital side, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III significantly raises the quantity and quality of capital required of internationally active bank holding companies.", "This ensures that the firm's shareholders will bear all the firm's losses across a much wider range of scenarios than before.", "This should strengthen market discipline.", "Meanwhile, to the extent that some of the specific activities that generate significant externalities are now subject to higher capital charges, this should cause banks to alter their business activities in ways that reduce both the likelihood and social cost of their failure.", "Moreover, the new Basel regime explicitly adjusts capital requirements upward based on size, complexity, interconnectedness, global exposure and substitutability - attributes that are proxies for the negative externalities generated by failure.", "If a bank is deemed a global systemic financial institution or G-SIFI, then it will have to hold a greater amount of capital relative to its risk-weighted assets compared to a less systemic institution.", "The notion behind the SIFI surcharge is a simple one.", "The cost to society from the failure of a large, complex firm is proportionally considerably higher than the cost to society of the failure of a non-systemic firm.", "As a result the capital buffer for the more systemic firm should be higher so that its expected probability of failure will be lower than for the less systemic firm.", "The SIFI surcharge acts as a penalty for size and complexity, leaning against the funding cost advantage a firm may have because it is perceived to be TBTF.", "This helps level the playing field for smaller firms and reduces the incentive to seek to become TBTF in the first place.", "Domestically, we have adopted a more forward-looking approach to capital through the use of stress tests, in particular the annual Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR) program.", "By promoting transparency, CCAR also strengthens market discipline.", "On the liquidity front, the largest, most systemically important bank holding companies will be required to hold a 30-day liquidity buffer - the so-called liquidity coverage ratio or LCR.", "The purpose of the LCR is to ensure that such a bank will have sufficient liquid resources so if it were to encounter business difficulties and temporarily lose access to market funding, it would still have some time to address its underlying problems.", "With a liquidity buffer, banks will not immediately be forced to sell illiquid assets during times of stress.", "This should enhance their stability, and provide some protection against the fire sale externalities we saw during the crisis: forced asset sales, falling asset prices, leading to rising capital losses at other firms that led, in turn, to further funding difficulties, asset sales and so on.", "On the supervisory side, firms are now increasingly being evaluated on a cross-industry basis in order to identify best practices and to identify laggards that need to upgrade areas such as MIS, governance, model validation, and risk management practices.", "Activity restrictions are another potential means to reduce the risk of failure.", "The biggest initiative in this area is the Volcker Rule.", "By limiting proprietary trading activities, the Volcker Rules seeks to reduce trading risk and the likelihood of failure.", "In addition, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is in the process of identifying those non-bank financial firms that are systemically important.", "These firms will be subject to tougher prudential standards and supervisory oversight by the Federal Reserve.", "Some argue that this designation process merely creates more TBTF firms.", "The system risk externalities do not depend on whether we label them systemic or not.", "If these risks are present, then we should face up to the issue with tougher standards and enhanced supervisory oversight rather than leave the issue unaddressed.", "This has to be a superior approach relative to pretending these firms could not be TBTF and the problem doesn't exist.", "Policy measures to reduce the adverse systemic consequences from failure Because no plausible level of capital and liquidity standards will be sufficient to reduce the probability of failure to zero, it also makes sense to work on the other major margin -
