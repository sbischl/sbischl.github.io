{"sentences": [" Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2018 Delivered by Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy Central Bank of Sri Lanka 1.", "Introduction Your Excellencies, Members of the Monetary Board, Senior Deputy Governor, Deputy Governors and Officials of the Central Bank, Distinguished Invitees, Ladies and Gentlemen, First, let me warmly welcome you to the presentation of this year's Road Map.", "Continuing our tradition that was initiated in 2007, today we are pleased to present the eleventh Road Map of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.", "It is our belief that sharing our future policy direction and actions would help you to plan your business trajectory with more certainty.", "I hope this Road Map will enhance the transparency and clarity of our policies, which would help you to achieve your targets more effectively.", "The successful outcomes in your businesses would ultimately help us to implement our policies more effectively for the benefit of both the economy and people of Sri Lanka.", "The year 2017 was challenging.", "We have seen economy-wide effects due to inclement weather conditions.", "The drought and floods disturbed agriculture activities and agro based industrial activities.", "Spillover effects of these adverse weather conditions impacted the other sectors of the economy as well.", "As a result, economic growth is expected to be subdued and lower than we projected at the beginning of the year.", "The tight monetary policy stance of the Central Bank as well as the relatively tight fiscal policy stance of the government, which were adopted with the aim of regaining macroeconomic stability, partly affected public and private investment spending that also contributed to low economic growth.", "Consumer price inflation increased, mainly due to high food prices associated with weather related domestic supply disruptions, revisions to indirect taxes and increased prices of imported commodities, making our efforts to anchor inflation expectations challenging.", "Despite the tight monetary policy stance maintained by the Central Bank, growth of monetary aggregates was high during most of 2017, before decelerating to envisaged levels towards the end of the year.", "Although we have seen signs of a firm recovery in exports with better prospects in key export markets and the flexible exchange rate policy of the Central Bank, the trade account continued to be affected by a largely weather induced increase in import expenditure.", "The decline in workers' remittances resulted in a reduction in the cushion against the widening trade deficit in the external current account.", "Although the fiscal sector has recorded notable improvements in terms of revenue collection, some slippage in the budget deficit is likely in 2017 mainly as a result of weather related fiscal costs and higher interest payments.", "This could have an adverse impact on achieving the envisaged fiscal consolidation path, while complicating the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies.", "Despite these challenges, 2017 was a year when we made significant progress on many fronts through several policy measures taken by the Central Bank in coordination with the government.", "In response to these measures, macroeconomic stability is being restored and our economy is trending in the right direction.", "The Central Bank has implemented several proactive policy measures during 2017 in order to achieve the core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability.", "Three frameworks have been put in place to improve the country's overall macroeconomic conditions.", "Attention is also being paid to institutionalising them.", "The Central Bank is working towards implementing a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework by 2020 to conduct monetary policy in a proactive and forward-looking manner.", "It has also adopted a more flexible exchange rate policy that promotes export competitiveness.", "The government is also committed to a revenue based fiscal consolidation programme, which intends to bring down budget deficits and debt levels progressively.", "If we get fiscal policy and monetary policy right, then the pressure on the exchange rate would reduce.", "Let me discuss these frameworks in a detailed manner.", "On the monetary policy framework, the Central Bank's move towards introducing a FIT regime aims to maintain a low inflation environment on a sustained basis.", "The FIT framework is a data-driven, forward-looking and proactive monetary policy regime built upon three main pillars: strong fiscal policy support, effective monetary policy conduct, and strong central bank mandate and credibility.", "The government has also endorsed this move to adopt a FIT regime as stated in its Vision 2025 policy document.", "In order to successfully implement the FIT framework, we have formulated a road map outlining several milestones to be completed by the government and the Central Bank, including the necessary legislative, institutional and operational changes.", "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recognised our move towards FIT by giving us necessary technical assistance on capacity building.", "The Central Bank accommodated greater flexibility in the exchange rate in 2017 by allowing market forces to determine the rate.", "The market reacted positively to this policy initiative by reviving the spot market.", "The Central Bank continued to absorb foreign exchange from the domestic interbank foreign exchange market in order to build up the quantum of non- borrowed foreign exchange reserves.", "This move also helped to smoothen the exchange rate behaviour.", "There were even some instances of appreciation of the rupee in 2017, indicating significant inflows to the foreign exchange market.", "Sri Lanka also received the fourth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the IMF in December 2017.", "A total of US dollars 759.9 million has been received so far.", "This confirms Sri Lanka's satisfactory performance in achieving IMF-EFF targets during 2017 in terms of specified performance criteria and certain structural benchmarks.", "Earnings from exports increased owing to the recovery in key export markets, the Central Bank policy of maintaining exchange rate flexibility, conducive external trade policies and improved macroeconomic conditions of the country.", "Further, the reinstatement of the EU GSP+ facility, the expected conclusion of the free trade agreements with Singapore, China and India and strong institutional and policy support are also expected to drive the momentum in exports.", "We have seen an increased inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2017 and we expect FDI to gain momentum through the commencement of the Hambantota industrial zone and the continuation of the Colombo Port City project.", "Higher inflows to the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as well as long term financial flows to the government were also witnessed during the year.", "With these developments on the external front, the Central Bank was able to build official reserves of over US dollars 7.9 billion at the end of 2017.", "On the fiscal front, the government has embarked on a revenue based fiscal consolidation path to strengthen the country's public finances.", "The government expects to reduce the budget deficit to 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020 and thereby reduce government debt to a sustainable level in the medium-term.", "It is in the process of implementing several reforms aimed at improving government revenue collection while rationalising government expenditures to adhere to the envisaged fiscal consolidation path over the medium-term.", "A positive primary balance is expected in 2017 for the first time since the early 1950s and a surplus in the current account is also expected in 2018 for the first time since 1987.", "The reform agenda of the government includes improving financial viability of the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to mitigate the budgetary implications for the government.", "While introducing clear frameworks and reforms in relation to monetary and exchange rate policies in 2017, we have implemented several policy measures during 2017 to address the challenges in the financial sector and maintain a stable financial system for effective monetary policy transmission and to support sustainable growth.", "With a view to promote a dynamic and resilient financial sector, the regulatory and supervisory framework of the Central Bank was further strengthened in line with international standards and best practices.", "At present, our banking sector accounts for over Rs.", "10 trillion in assets, while the non-bank financial institutions sector accounts for over Rs.", "The implementation of Basel III capital standards was commenced in 2017 in order to develop a more robust banking sector.", "The framework to regulate the non-bank financial institutions was strengthened under challenging conditions, and resolution of distressed finance companies was also commenced.", "During 2017, the Central Bank continued to strengthen the regulatory framework for the microfinance sector, and continued to combat the menace of illegal pyramid schemes with the assistance of other government agencies.", "Several measures were adopted to strengthen and modernise the payment and settlement infrastructure in order to develop an efficient and stable payment and settlement system in the country, as well as to pave the way towards a digital economy.", "Being a trusted, professionally competent and strong institution, the Central Bank is entrusted with vital agency functions.", "Accordingly, as per our mandate, we carried out public debt management with the objective of mobilising the government's financing requirements at the lowest possible cost and with a prudent degree of risk.", "The framework for public debt management was reinforced by introducing a transparent market based auction mechanism for the issuance of government securities.", "This has already resulted in desirable outcomes of lowering interest costs to the government, efficient price discovery and improved transmission of monetary policy signals across the benchmark yield curve.", "The Employees' Provident Fund, which is the largest superannuation fund in the country, is managed by the Central Bank.", "It passed a significant milestone during 2017 with total assets of the Fund surpassing Rs.", "The Central Bank also continued to promote financial literacy and inclusiveness and helped entrepreneurship development through our credit schemes for agriculture and livestock, as well as the micro, small and medium scale enterprise (MSME) sectors.", "In addition, we also adopted measures to promote a clean note policy in the country and improvements were also made in currency operations and processing.", "In 2017, the Central Bank implemented a new legislative and a policy framework for foreign exchange operations based on the Foreign Exchange Act, No.", "Provisions of the new Act are being implemented through the newly established Department of Foreign Exchange in the Central Bank focusing on reducing restrictions, excluding ambiguities, simplifying processes and enhancing efficiency associated with foreign exchange transactions while striving for clarity and convenience.", "A significant amount of work needs to be done to improve Sri Lanka's global ranking in the implementation of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.", "The Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank is taking several measures to address this with the assistance of key government Ministries and Departments as well as stakeholders such as Licensed Banks, Licensed Finance Companies, Regulators, Stock Brokers and Insurance Companies, and continued to enter into new MOUs with other country FIUs.", "The Central Bank has already initiated several measures to enhance the economic stability of the country and it will continue with this endeavor in the future as well.", "Given improved economic fundamentals and stability, it is expected that the government will implement the necessary policy reforms to uplift the economy from the prevailing low growth trajectory to reach its potential level.", "The government's Vision 2025 unveils the future policy direction of the country.", "The Vision envisages transforming Sri Lanka into a hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social-market economy.", "Accordingly, considering the limited scope of the domestic market, sustained future economic growth would have to be generated from external demand.", "Hence, effective and sustainable long- term policy measures have to be implemented for accessing foreign markets through exploiting trade and investment opportunities.", "We also observe that frequent natural calamities hamper economic activity resulting in a moderation of economic expansion.", "This highlights the need for diversification of growth drivers in the economy as well as putting the necessary measures in place to strengthen the economy's resilience through mainstreaming sustainability into the planning and budgeting processes and improving disaster preparedness.", "In the global context, after having a series of economic distortions and negative shocks after the Global Financial Crisis, now the global economy is gradually recovering.", "Investment conditions have improved and global trade also rebounded in 2017.", "So, we need to exploit opportunities created by the revival of global growth supported by synchronized economic expansion in Europe, Japan and the US for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis.", "Better prospects in Europe and the US, which are our two largest markets, are clearly tailwinds.", "This is growth positive for Sri Lanka.", "However, we should also be mindful that gradual normalisation of monetary policies in the advanced countries could pose some challenges to the economy on both external and fiscal fronts.", "Sri Lanka is gradually transforming to upper middle income economy status.", "Sustained progress will inevitably involve greater integration with the world economy.", "While creating opportunities, this will also expose the economy to greater uncertainties and risks.", "In order to face the current and future challenges proactively, and to address the already identified deficiencies in the existing processes, the Central Bank, as outlined in its latest Strategic Plan for the medium term, expects to robustly strengthen its institutional frameworks by: a) enhancing the monetary policy framework; b) strengthening the financial sector oversight; c) modernising payment and settlements; and, d) upgrading public debt management.", "The improved policy frameworks will enable the country to take advantage of greater integration, while mitigating the risks involved and increasing the resilience of the economy.", "In this respect, as already mentioned, we are steadily progressing towards an effective FIT framework to ensure price stability.", "At the same time, we are striving to promote a dynamic and resilient financial sector in order to lower vulnerabilities in the financial system.", "This is a priority for achieving objectives in relation to growth, employment and incomes.", "Modernising the infrastructure of the payments and settlements system to pave the path towards a less cash society and facilitating a digital economy are also important policy priorities in the medium term.", "We are also determined to strive for prudent debt management with a view to ensure debt sustainability, enhance effectiveness and transparency of the primary auction system, promote market development and minimise risks.", "Our policies are aligned to achieve these strategic priorities which will be instrumental in supporting the country's economic and price stability and financial system stability.", "In this context, the Road Map 2018 reviews the policy actions that have been pursued during 2017 and more importantly, proposes policies and actions for the forthcoming period.", "Accordingly, the outline of the Road Map 2018 is as follows: Section 2: The Central Bank's monetary policy strategy and policies for 2018 and Section 3: The Central Bank's policies related to the financial sector performance and stability in 2018 and beyond Section 4: Key policies related to strengthening the broader economy through the Central Bank's agency and ancillary functions Now, let me elaborate on these sections in a detailed manner.", "Monetary Policy Strategy and Policies for 2018 and Beyond The Central Bank is entrusted with the task of maintaining price stability.", "Price stability remains a key fundamental in fostering an environment conducive for sustained growth and securing rising living standards for the people.", "The Central Bank seeks to achieve its price stability objective through the conduct of monetary policy.", "Based on the current monetary policy framework, we have been able to maintain inflation in single digits for close to a decade.", "Going forward, the introduction of an effective Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework will improve our capacity to deliver price stability.", "This will provide a more propitious environment for growth and employment generation.", "Our motivation towards adopting inflation targeting as the monetary policy framework was signaled a number of years ago, as we recognised it as the most appropriate way to escape from the high inflation-low growth trap.", "The weakened relationship between money and inflation and deepening financial markets were among the major factors that encouraged this move.", "Under the proposed FIT framework, the Central Bank will aim to preserve price stability of the economy by targeting an inflation range of 4-6 per cent.", "We believe that this target range is desirable for a country like ours in view of the vulnerability of the economy to supply or external shocks.", "We will employ market-based instruments, particularly the policy interest rates and open market operations (OMO) of the Central Bank, to influence market conditions and to navigate inflation in the targeted mid-single digit range.", "Variables such as overall monetary expansion and credit disbursements to the private sector by commercial banks will remain as key indicative variables to guide monetary policy conduct.", "We have now progressed into a time-bound plan to make this leap towards FIT a reality.", "The period starting from 2018 will be vital in laying out required reforms to facilitate a smooth transition to a FIT framework.", "In this context, we have identified three important pillars as the building blocks for adopting a FIT framework; 1.", "Strong Central Bank mandate and credibility 2.", "Effective monetary policy conduct 3.", "Strong fiscal policy support and commitment Now let me discuss some key elements and building blocks of FIT.", "A strong Central Bank mandate and credibility is essential for successful adoption of FIT.", "There is considerable evidence from around the world that weak legal mandates together with inadequate autonomy of central banks hinder the success of FIT.", "In this context, Sri Lanka will also have to introduce considerable changes to the existing mandate of the Central Bank through necessary legal reforms.", "The current framework is hampered by the focus on non-core activities, monetary financing and inadequate autonomy.", "These factors are structural impediments in the transition path towards FIT.", "Amending the Monetary Law Act (MLA) is, therefore, imperative to enhance the focus of the mandate as well as Central Bank autonomy, governance, transparency and accountability.", "These amendments would broadly include strengthening the mandate of price stability, separating the monetary and fiscal functions, strengthening the Central Bank's autonomy, and introducing institutional arrangements for setting inflation targets and maintaining accountability.", "Second, to assure effective monetary policy conduct as a vital building block for maintaining low inflation under the FIT, we need to establish a sound, forward-looking decision-making process, based on reliable macroeconomic forecasts and projections.", "In this connection, the Central Bank has already improved technical capacity in modelling and forecasting of key macroeconomic variables.", "The Central Bank and the IMF have jointly developed a structural model-based Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which encompasses near-term and medium-term model-based projections.", "The current policy formulation process is gradually being aligned with the analysis based on FPAS.", "This is supporting the monetary policy formulation process in a more proactive and forward-looking manner.", "The Central Bank will continue to improve model-based projections through building sound technical infrastructure for inflation forecasting and macroeconomic analyses.", "Moreover, the monetary policy formulation process is also being upgraded by introducing a forecast calendar, which outlines schedules for projections and revisions of forecasts linked to the availability of important economic data and events.", "Accordingly, during each monetary policy round, two technical staff level meetings are conducted to obtain inputs and feedback for forecasting followed by a pre-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting attended by the members of the MPC and technical staff to discuss projections and sectoral developments.", "The formal MPC meeting takes place subsequently to make recommendations to the Monetary Board.", "The number of MPC meetings during a year were also reduced to 8, allowing sufficient time for technical staff to undertake more sophisticated macroeconomic analysis.", "In the new forward-looking framework, it is of utmost importance to monitor developments in both current and future economic conditions.", "In this regard, we will strengthen the existing surveys of expectations and economic conditions to gain forward-looking insights to improve accuracy of forecasts.", "With regard to monetary operations, the domestic money market is being actively managed through OMO to steer the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR) in line with the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank.", "We have taken several progressive measures to communicate more information, including cut-off yield rates of the OMO auctions and overnight liquidity estimates with a view to encouraging more efficient price discovery in the money market and promoting informed decision making by market participants as well as to improve market signaling of OMO.", "The Central Bank will continue to actively engage in liquidity management, while guiding the short-term interest rates along a desired path.", "Several measures, such as reviewing the compilation methodology of benchmark interest rates, strengthening the operational framework pertaining to the Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF), introducing a rule-based code of conduct for Authorised Money Brokers and promoting market development will be taken to improve the efficiency and compliance in respect of money market operations.", "As announced last year, the Monetary Policy Consultation Committee (MPCC) was re- established in mid-2017 to draw on external expertise to support the conduct of monetary policy.", "We will continue to take on board stakeholders' views and align our policies in a way, which is mutually beneficial for stakeholders and the Central Bank.", "As the conduct of monetary policy is dependent on an effective and prudent exchange rate policy, the Central Bank has introduced a more market based exchange rate system.", "It has allowed more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on the market conditions and has intervened only to smoothen volatility and to build up reserves.", "It is noteworthy that there has been a build-up of non-debt creating international reserves during 2017, with minimal impact on the exchange rate.", "Going forward, foreign exchange intervention policies will be adopted, which are consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime and supportive of improving foreign exchange market functionality.", "Maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be an important objective of the Central Bank.", "In line with this policy, we will continue to focus more on non-debt creating financial flows in building up reserves.", "Ongoing policy reforms of the government focus on boosting exports as well as attracting FDI.", "This gives greater salience to our agenda of maintaining flexibility in the exchange rate to boost competitiveness.", "The Board of Investment (BOI) has estimated FDI to have reached US dollars 1.5 billion in 2017, which will be a key milestone and could possibly be a turning point in FDI inflows.", "The commencement of the Hambantota Industrial Zone and the continuation of the Colombo Port City project are expected to bring significant FDI flows from 2018 onwards.", "Annual FDI flows of US dollars 2-3 billion are expected in the coming years.", "In addition to boosting growth and employment, it will also enhance external sector resilience by generating non-debt creating inflows and boosting exports.", "The Central Bank will continue to manage reserves in line with a model based Strategic Asset Allocation framework (SAA), to ensure foreign exchange reserves are managed with the objective of ensuring an adequate level of liquidity and a reasonable return in comparison to benchmarks.", "Inflation targeting is well understood as \"management of expectations\".", "Monetary policy affects inflation and the real economy mainly through its effects on private-sector expectations about future interest rates, inflation and economic activity.", "In this context, transparency in monetary policy is vital.", "This places a very high premium on effective communication.", "We believe our communication must be open, objective and up to date in order to effectively anchor expectations of the stakeholders.", "Therefore, we are working on improving the Central Bank's communication strategy in order to enhance public understanding of the new framework.", "Several initiatives are already being pursued to enhance communication.", "This Road map remains at the centre of this communication policy.", "We already set out the macroeconomic direction of the economy over the medium-term through several year-round publications, press releases and press conferences.", "Further, as per the Road Map set out for FIT, several other initiatives, including further enhancing the analytical value of the Monetary Policy Review statement, issuing regular Monetary Policy Reports, publishing Inflation Reports and launching a public awareness outreach programme are also on our menu in the transition towards FIT.", "In accordance with our commitment to set out an advance release calendar for the regular monetary policy announcements, we would like to announce the following calendar for the year 2018.", "Monetary Policy Announcements in 2018 1 16 February, Friday 2 4 April, Wednesday 3 11 May, Friday 4 29 June, Friday 5 3 August, Friday 6 28 September, Friday 7 14 November, Wednesday 8 28 December, Friday The Central Bank cannot implement a successful FIT framework alone.", "As we have emphasised in the past, the continued and strong commitment of the government will be of paramount importance.", "It is encouraging that the government has already recognised the Central Bank's move towards FIT as the future framework for monetary policy, in its policy document \"Vision 2025- A Country Enriched\".", "Continued strong commitment of the government towards greater fiscal discipline and stronger fiscal outcomes remain key to the successful adoption of FIT.", "In particular, the government is expected to maintain its commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, which is embedded in the IMF-EFF arrangement.", "The improved fiscal space through continued fiscal consolidation will create a better enabling environment for the effective and independent conduct of monetary policy.", "This whole effort requires the government's commitment to remain on the trajectory of fiscal consolidation it has enunciated in its medium-term budgetary framework.", "The new Inland Revenue Act, enacted with the aim of simplifying and rationalising the existing income tax structure; the VAT reforms; and the improvements in tax administration are worthy achievements.", "Further, the government expects to strengthen fiscal consolidation by revising the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act to include binding fiscal targets.", "This would institutionalize its commitment to fiscal discipline, which is essential given the country's external debt dynamics and exposure to rating agencies and international capital markets.", "Further, to institutionalise the autonomy of the Central Bank, it is vital to shield monetary policy from fiscal dominance.", "In this regard, a strong legal and institutional mandate for the Central Bank is expected to ensure a clear separation between monetary and fiscal policy as part of the transition to the FIT.", "This requires phasing out of monetisation of fiscal deficits by the Central Bank.", "This will also pave the way to a deeper and liquid financial market which will be a catalyst for effective transmission of monetary policy actions of the Central Bank.", "We also see the proposed Liability Management Act of the government as a prudent strategy.", "It allows the government to manage public debt in a more flexible manner.", "Under this framework, the public debt manager would create a buffer fund to minimise the rollover risk of debt stock eliminating the necessity for the Central Bank to provide financial assistance to the government at the beginning of each year as per the current provisions of the MLA.", "Even more importantly, it will create the space to go beyond the government's borrowing requirement in any given year to mobilise financing to address the current bunching of external debt payments from 2019.", "The government's decision to earmark the proceeds of divestitures for liability management is also a very favourable development in this regard.", "Meanwhile, the government's commitment to reform state owned enterprises (SOEs) is commendable.", "In particular, automatic pricing mechanisms for fuel and electricity are expected to be introduced in March and September 2018, respectively.", "This will go a long way towards reducing the future financial losses of key SOEs and avoid large ad hoc adjustments in retail prices.", "Not only will this be supportive of the effective conduct of monetary policy, but it will also have a positive impact on the balance sheets of both the government and the state banks.", "As we know, the Central Bank alone cannot manage inflation and inflation expectations in the economy.", "It cannot influence supply side factors affecting inflation.", "Although monetary policy is effective in controlling demand driven inflation, the support of the government is essential in managing supply side pressures on inflation.", "In this regard, timely support of the government is necessary in dampening supply shocks, thereby anchoring inflation.", "Several key milestones need to be reached over the next three years through the joint efforts and the commitment of the government and the Central Bank to fulfill the key prerequisites of the FIT framework.", "Legal amendments, continuation of fiscal consolidation, institutionalisation of the required changes to the monetary and fiscal policy processes, and building awareness and the confidence of the general public are the priorities in the near future before the official transition to the FIT framework by 2020.", "In this regard, as mentioned, we have devised a Road Map for adopting FIT, outlining the necessary reforms and innovations.", "This is largely aimed at institutional features, organisational features, operational features, monetary policy implementation, exchange rate policy and foreign exchange operations as well as capacity building, while aligning both fiscal and monetary policy towards achieving economic targets set in a coherent manner.", "When setting our monetary policy actions and directions, we cannot disregard the external environment.", "In the global economy, for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis, there is currently a divergence of monetary policy among the major economies.", "This is likely to result in greater volatility in capital and currency markets.", "This requires us to be vigilant.", "We are aware that interest rate hikes in advance economies such as the US and the UK as well as in emerging economies could have some spillover impact on the Sri Lankan economy through capital reallocation.", "Meanwhile, economic and political developments in major export destinations, as well as trends in key commodity prices, will also have a significant impact on the domestic economy.", "Financial Sector Policies for 2018 and Beyond Being guided by its mandate, the Central Bank promotes a dynamic and resilient financial sector, which supports sustainable growth, primarily through regulation and supervision of financial institutions, ensuring sound and safe payment and settlement systems, establishing risk management systems and instilling good corporate governance standards and practices in the financial sector.", "Falling in line with international standards and best practices, the Central Bank has introduced several policy reforms, in 2017, to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework relating to FIs under the purview of the Central Bank thus ensuring financial system stability.", "It is also noteworthy to mention that we have re-established the Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC) in 2017 comprising reputed and well experienced professionals, experts as well as the representatives from the institutions and regulatory bodies in the financial sector.", "Inputs of the FSSCC are helpful in devising appropriate decisions for maintaining financial system stability.", "Going forward, there is an overarching need to amend the Banking Act to ensure that the banking sector is guided by legislation which sufficiently accounts for the change in the sectoral landscape and the challenges that may arise as the sector rapidly grows and evolves, across the country and beyond.", "The Central Bank is proactively working with all relevant stakeholders of the banking sector and looks forward to finalising a new Banking Act in the near-term.", "Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking sector remains at the centre of our financial sector policy.", "As such, we are continuing to upgrade and enhance the bank examination methodology to ensure that the focus of examinations is not entirely a rule-based one that concentrates only on compliance, but also one which gives due consideration to the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of individual banks and the entire banking sector.", "Accordingly, initiatives are underway to assign ratings to banks based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators that will assess their efficiency and sustainability.", "During the course of this year, we expect to finalise the bank examination methodology based on the Bank Sustainability Risk Index (BSRI) to facilitate the transition from an annual 'on-site' examination approach to a 'risk-based' supervision approach.", "Further, we intend to incorporate BSRI to examination reports of all licensed banks and assign a supervisory rating grade for banks with effect from 2019, on a staggered basis.", "Banks have also been engaged in the implementation of Basel III capital standards and implementation is to be completed by 1 January 2019.", "While banks have been working on the improvement of their capital adequacy ratios, a capital conservation buffer and a surcharge on domestic systemically important banks have been imposed to ensure that banks actively build capital buffers.", "The direction to increase the existing minimum capital requirements was targeted at improving the quality of capital to ensure that these buffers are of a more resilient nature.", "This will help safeguard the banking sector during periods of excessive credit growth and/or adverse economic conditions.", "It will also minimise the systemic risk arising from the interconnectedness among banks.", "Under the Basel III guidelines, banks will also be required to comply with guidelines regarding a Net Stable Funding Ratio with due consideration to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet exposures.", "A consultation paper has already been issued to banks in this regard and the relevant standard is to be implemented during this year.", "The Leverage Ratio is also to be introduced as a simple, transparent and non-risk based tool that will supplement other risk-based capital requirements.", "The implementation of guidelines related to this ratio is expected to curb the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking sector.", "While we operate a deposit insurance and liquidity support scheme, an effective crisis management and resolution framework is a precondition for effective supervision.", "We are working closely with all relevant stakeholders to guide banks with the maintenance of appropriate recovery plans.", "Preliminary guidelines regarding the adoption of Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standard 9 (SLFRS 9) are also to be issued during the year to ensure the appropriate classification and measurement of financial assets.", "Directions have already been issued to the banks on financial derivative transactions to streamline the risk management processes.", "Further, new directions have been issued on foreign currency borrowing limits based on the total assets of a bank, replacing the previous direction involving assets of Domestic Banking Unit (DBU) only.", "With several new developments in the pipeline for the banking sector, we understand that it is essential to review the existing criteria and the mechanism for the selection of the panel of qualified auditors.", "The guidelines from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also emphasise this.", "The existing criteria and selection process are undergoing a rigorous review to strengthen the current assessment process and uplift the quality of audits so that auditors are also abreast with the emerging risks and implications of the Basel III framework and the new accounting standards that are to be enforced within the next few years.", "With a view of facilitating risk management of emerging technologies and to encourage further digitalisation of banking operations, several policies will be introduced to define regulatory expectations on use of cloud computing and define minimum regulations on the use of relevant fintech solutions.", "Further, a comprehensive technology risk assessment programme would be conducted to assess and improve the technology risk resilience of banks.", "Over the last five years, while the banking sector has grown approximately by 15 per cent annually, the non-bank financial institutions sector has grown approximately by 20 per cent.", "Although the sector accounts for a comparatively small share of around 8 per cent of the total assets of the financial system, the rapid growth and broad outreach of the sector necessitate proactive supervision and regulatory guidance.", "While several regulations have been introduced to strengthen these institutions, some licensed finance companies have shown signs of stress, while the rapid expansion of certain others have been curtailed due to their lack of compliance with regulatory requirements.", "This reiterates the need for continued strengthening of the existing regulatory framework of non-bank financial institutions to ensure the soundness of the sector and contain its spillover effects on the whole system.", "Initiatives are already underway to resolve such weaknesses through mergers and recapitalisation of such finance companies through strategic investors.", "It should also be mentioned that in addition to the Board of Directors, the senior management of these institutions are also equally responsible for the operations of the institutions.", "The Central Bank will consider implementing the legal provisions against the errant senior management, if warranted, in the interest of depositors.", "In mid-2017, we set up an 'Enforcement Division' within the Legal and Compliance Department of the Central Bank to carry out duties relating to enforcement and resolution issues pertaining to financial institutions, combating the pervasion of prohibited schemes and other unauthorised financial undertakings, while also curbing violations related to exchange management.", "This Division has been converted into a full-fledged Department as at 1 January 2018.", "We have also undertaken measures to enhance our surveillance mechanism.", "Improvements to the early warning systems are also being effected.", "During the last year, the system has helped provide proactive and timely guidance.", "In addition, the existing internal mechanism has also undergone a review process.", "As announced in the Road Map 2017, the capital levels of licensed finance companies (LFCs) and specialised leasing companies (SLCs) are expected to be strengthened further.", "The minimum core capital requirement has been revised upwards from Rs.", "The strengthening of the capital position will improve the resilience of existing institutions while encouraging only the more financially efficient and effective companies to remain in the sector.", "Improved capital positions are also essential for the smooth consolidation of the sector in the near-term through market driven acquisitions or mergers.", "There are also ongoing discussions on the encouragement of LFCs and SLCs to obtain credit ratings and list themselves on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).", "This will, in turn, ensure financial stability and operational excellence while creating healthy competition.", "We also consider imposing directions that LFCs and SLCs achieve a capital adequacy ratio of 12 per cent with the intention of improving sensitivity to risks, while
