sometimes working against the tide of popular thinking.", "This has led to a more nuanced approach to the development of microfinance over time, and an ongoing process of rethinking norms which we may take for granted today.", "Today, I would like to talk about three perspectives that have shaped the way we approach and implement microfinance in Malaysia.", "First, technology when used in a clever way, can be of great use.", "While technological advancements hold great promise for expanding access to financial services for the poor, we need to invest time and resources to understand the factors that affect the poor, and the suitable approach to generate income and create wealth.", "These insights are what will determine whether technology is central or peripheral to the inclusion agenda.", "Second, the tradeoffs between financial stability and inclusion requires smart management.", "A microfinance strategy that focuses largely or wholly on providing credit to the unserved is almost

two things in common; an obsessive focus on operational innovations and the ability to create powerful synergies.", "We have built on these premises to continuously adapt, amplify and align our approach.", "This year, we have embarked on an initiative, working with the Credit Guarantee Corporation in Malaysia, to develop behavioral insights that will enable microfinance providers to integrate business and technological strategies that best serve the poor.", "The initiative will leverage on analytics to identify drivers of borrower behavior, and expand the use of psychometric tools by financial providers to develop financial solutions that are more responsive to the needs and circumstances of micro borrowers.", "A deeper understanding of borrower behaviors also provides a

commitments.", "Repayment reminders, delivered in ways that are relatable to the poor (for example, \"your repayment can help your friend in need\"), can help keep repayments current.", "Working through local community groups to engage borrowers, or identifying with religious tenets to overcome weak willpower to repay, are some experiential learning that creates favorable conditions that can expand access to credit and encourage high repayment rates.", "These \"small nudges\", a notion popularized by behavioral scientist David Halpern, allow us to revisualise how operating models and

spending towards healthcare, education and nutrition.", "It has empowered women with more decision-making power and enabled children to spend more on school supplies that ultimately led to better test scores.", "Insurance has also been shown to play an important role in encouraging micro enterprises and low income households to make productive investments without the fear of natural disasters or

increase savings and manage their exposures, this would greatly improve the probability of success in business and enhance socioeconomic mobility.", "This in turn will bring many important benefits to

dates from street corners in and around Kuala Lumpur.", "He travelled daily to and from night markets and mosques on his motorcycle; his fortunes often at the mercy of unpredictable weather.", "But

same time, created jobs for 10 persons within his community.", "As a contribution to his community, one of the three branches was dedicated for micro-entrepreneurs in the locality to showcase their

owners of small businesses plying delicate handicraft and innovative accessories.", "There are many examples such as this, that if done right, can create a virtuous cycle of expanded positive spillovers that uplift the community as a whole.", "Despite what seems to be an increasingly crowded space, microfinance often ends up being relegated to government-sponsored institutions, non-profit enterprises and donor organizations, because it is perceived to be financially unsustainable if a certain scale is not achieved (usually very large) or imposing high interest rates to hedge risks or cover high operational costs.", "A growing body of experience shows that the reverse is necessary to deliver a lasting positive impact on the lives of the poor.", "I have alluded earlier that aligning operational strategies with behaviors of micro borrowers can improve loan performance, thus reducing risks to lenders.", "In insurance, traditional agency-based distribution models are being disrupted
