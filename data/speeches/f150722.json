in the developed nations in 1970s as a financial innovation.", "The regulatory ethos of those days let the innovation thrive with least regulations.", "However, the lessons from the great financial crisis of 2008 activated a number of initiatives by the international standard setting bodies, regulators and governments for re-building investor confidence in the securitisation market.", "These initiatives were mainly aimed at addressing the concerns on conflicts of interest created by misaligned incentives and compensation systems for securitisers or originators within the securitisation chain, address information asymmetry within the securitisation process by increasing transparency of the securitisation structure, introduce risk retention or \"skin in game\" requirements and more stringent disclosure requirements, enhance oversight of credit rating agencies governance and reduce regulator reliance on ratings, better align the incentives of mortgage originators with those of investors in mortgage loans, standardization of disclosure documentation, etc.", "The foremost among these are the Basel III Standards and enhancements to the Basel II Norms by BCBS, The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reforms and Consumer Protection Act in USA, Capital Requirements Directive (CRD II) and a proposal for a Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) in the European Union, issue of Disclosure Principles for Public Offerings and Listings by IOSCO, and other such directives/ guidelines by G20, FSB, etc.", "As part of the Enhancement to the Basel II Norms in July 2009, the BCBS strengthened the treatment for certain Securitisation exposures under Pillar 1 (minimum capital requirements) and introduced higher risk weights for re-Securitisation exposures to better reflect the risk inherent in these products.", "It also required the banks to conduct more rigorous credit analyses of externally rated Securitisation exposures.", "The supplemental Pillar 2

models.", "This is followed by the External Ratings-Based Approach - where credit ratings are permitted to be used in the jurisdiction - and the Standardized Approach.", "Additional risk drivers, notably an explicit adjustment to take account of the maturity of a Securitisation's tranche, have been introduced.", "Recently, a joint BCBS-IOSCO Task Force on Securitisation Markets (TFSM)

the turning point towards the development of the corporate debt and securitisation market.", "The Reserve Bank accepted several of its recommendations and in February 2006, issued guidelines for securitisation of standard assets by Banks, FIs and NBFCs.", "These guidelines provided the regulatory framework for several critical aspects of securitisation.", "In 2007, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act 1956 was amended in 2007 to include \"securitised instruments\" in the definition of \"securities\".", "The amendment has paved the way for listing and trading of securitised debt on stock exchanges.", "Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released draft regulations for \"Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments\" in June 2007 which is yet to be formalised.", "However, these guidelines envisage a very different transaction structure compared to current market practices.", "Earlier, the enactment of the Securitisation and

system (banks, financial institutions and NBFCs) and has to ensure that financial intermediaries engage in Securitisation prudently.", "The Reserve Bank issued the first set of comprehensive guidelines applicable to banks, financial institutions and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) on Securitisation in India way back in February 2006.", "The guidelines covered following aspects relating to Securitisation transactions: \u2022 Broad definitions on important securitisation related concepts such as securitisation, SPV, bankruptcy remote, credit enhancement, first loss facility,

from the global financial crisis on Securitisation and with a view to develop an orderly and healthy securitisation market, the RBI guidelines of February 2006 were reviewed and enhancements to the guidelines issued in May 2012.", "While the securitisation framework in India had been reasonably prudent, certain imprudent practices had reportedly developed like origination of loans with the sole intention of immediate securitisation and securitisation of tranches of project loans even before the total disbursement was complete, thereby passing on the project implementation risk to investors.", "In view of the same and in accordance with the on-going international work on Securitisation, another important objective of the enhancements was to ensure greater alignment of the interests of the originators and investors and retention of \"skin in the game\" by the originators.", "These guidelines also covered prudential treatment for transfer of assets through direct assignment of cash flows and underlying securities, if any.", "The important features of the May 2012 guidelines are as follows: \u2022 Prescription of the Minimum Holding Period (MHP): Minimum Holding Period varies from 3 months to 12 months depending upon the tenor of the loan and repayment frequency and is defined in terms of number of installments paid.", "The criteria governing determination of MHP reflect the need to ensure that i) the project implementation risk is not passed on to the investors and ii) a minimum recovery performance is demonstrated prior to securitisation to ensure better underwriting standards.", "\u2022 Prescription of Minimum Retention Requirement (MRR) - 5 % for loans up to 24 months and 10% for loans of tenor beyond 24 months.", "The MRR is primarily designed to ensure that the originating banks have a continuing stake in the performance of securitised assets so as to ensure that they carry out proper due diligence of loans to be securitised.", "\u2022 \"True sale criteria\" made applicable to assignment transactions also.", "\u2022 Liberalised recognition of cash profit received allowed in view of the mitigation of concerns on \"Originate to Distribute\" models.", "\u2022 Disclosures requirements were strengthened and due diligence expectations were elaborated.", "\u2022 Stress testing requirements were laid for banks/FIs/ NBFCs in respect of their Securitisation positions.", "The factors for stress tests could include rise in default rates in the underlying portfolios in a situation of economic downturn, rise in prepayment rates due to fall in rate of interest or rise in income levels of the borrowers leading to early redemption of exposures, fall in rating of the credit enhancers resulting in fall in market value of securities (Asset Backed Securities/ Mortgage Backed Securities) and drying of liquidity of the securities resulting in higher prudent valuation adjustments, etc.", "\u2022 Outsourcing of credit decision is not allowed.", "\u2022 In case of non-compliance with the guidelines, as applicable to originators, no capital relief will be available for originators.", "For investors, in case of noncompliance with guidelines as applicable to investors, the asset will be risk weighted at 1111% (revised to 1250% in March 2015).", "\u2022 Certain forms of Securitisation transactions / structures are not allowed - Complex structures such as Re-Securitisation and Synthetic Securitisation is not allowed.", "Revolving credit facilities cannot be securitized / assigned.", "Single asset Securitisation are not allowed - as they do not fit into the definition of Securitisation.", "Securitisation / assignment of loans where both interest and principal are due only at maturity are not allowed - as it is not possible to assess the repayment track record.", "\u2022 Credit enhancement is not allowed in case of assignment transactions - as the assignment deals are generally carried out among two financial institutions.", "It is expected that the purchasing institution will do its own due diligence while acquiring assets rather than relying on credit enhancement.", "Indian Securitisation market and transaction volumes 21.", "The Indian market is still at a nascent stage driven as it is by the needs for meeting priority sector lending targets by banks.", "The band of originators and investors is narrow with NBFCs as the main originators and banks as investors.", "Public Sector Banks are mostly absent.", "Asset backed securitisation (ABS) is the largest securitisation class in India, driven by retail loan portfolio of banks.", "NBFCs like the Asset Finance Companies (AFC) operating in the SME and Transport financing segments and Micro Finance Institutions (MFI) are very active as originators.", "Though the market had begun since the year 2000, the GFC obviously has its repercussions in Indian market as well.", "It is reported that the Indian Securitisation market which reached a high of \u20b9 63,730 crore by March 2008 dwindled down to \u20b9 28,800 crore in by March 2014. .", "The micro finance companies play a larger role mainly due to their PSL underlying pools.", "Another positive development witnessed in recent years is the preference for multiple tranche products as against single tranche structures.", "Another encouraging factor is the preference for the lower rated senior tranches by the investors.", "It is reported that during the financial year 2014, the number of AAA ratings at initiation dropped from 45% in 2012 to 26%.", "Insurance, Pension and Mutual Funds can play an important role in the Indian securitisation market as they can invest long term and at the same time have the risk appetite, capacity and expertise for taking exposures to the lower tranches.", "However, the Pension Funds are not allowed to invest in securitisation PTCs and Insurance companies are allowed to invest in high investment grade AAA securities only.", "MFs are still hesitant to invest in the securitised papers due to past pending court cases as well as lack of clarity on the tax implications for their investments.", "In the Finance Bill 2013, Mutual Funds were exempted from application of the Distribution Tax imposed on securitisation SPV's.", "Low appetite for Securitisation in Indian financial market 24.", "The appetite for Securitisation in India has been on the lower side; it is used largely to meet priority sector lending targets by banks as investors, NBFCs being the originators.", "This low appetite can be ascribed to several factors, including legal, taxation and stamp duty issues.", "Recently, we undertook an informal and quick survey of the securitisation market in India.", "The primary objective was to assess the issues facing the market along with the reasons for poor take off in securitisation as a risk transfer and liquidity enhancing product.", "The sample survey included originators, investors, third party liquidity and credit enhancement providers, servicers and arrangers, SPVs / trustees, credit rating agencies, etc.", "The major issues highlighted by the participants related to disclosures, low demand for Long Tenor Receivables, lack of Investor base, absence of Secondary market besides the Taxation, Stamp Duty and Legal aspects including Foreclosure Laws.", "The way forward - ambling down or revving up 26.", "Though significant progress has been made in reconfiguring Securitisation markets in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the task of ensuring that these markets contribute to economic growth and financial stability is unfinished.", "In this context, we must note that fingers are pointed at the regulatory framework itself.", "It is alleged that the regulations are conservative, and inhibit the growth of the segment.", "The restrictions on assignments, the prohibition of re-securitisation, the restrictions on the insurance and pension funds, the restrictive first-loss provisions, the restrictive credit enhancement provisions etc.", "are mentioned as impediments.", "With tax related disincentives driving away investors like Mutual funds, and even banks, the critics say the Indian Securitisation market can only be ambling forward.", "In my opinion, the Indian Securitisation Market is raring to go.", "Firstly, the priority sector obligations will continue to be a good reason for securitisation.", "While the upcoming Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLC) can kind of dent the market, there will still be need for diversification of portfolios and hence the Securitisation will still have its place.", "Secondly, the NBFCs, be they Asset Finance Companies specialising in SME financing or transport financing, or be they MFIs or Housing Finance Companies (HFC), their USP is their capacity to originate loans and advances in sectors where the main stream banks have least penetration.", "They have comparative advantage and to leverage that they will have good opportunities in resorting to Securitisation.", "Thirdly, the new set of differentiated banks, the Small Finance Banks, whose major portfolio will be small loans, will resort to securitisation for diversifying their balance sheet.", "In all likelihood, they are unlikely to build capacity in large sized lending and will resort to build diversified portfolio of large credit through Securitisation.", "Fourthly, given recent experience relating to the stress and non-performance of infrastructure finance and project finance, questions have been raised about the capacity of other than large banks in the credit appraisal of such large credits.", "This can compel these banks to participate in large infrastructure and project credits through Securitisation after the project has taken off, rather than participating through consortium or multiple banking arrangement before the cash flows have emanated.", "For these to happen, there is a need for a change in the mind set and attitude of banks and financial institutions, including the NBFCs.", "These institutions should reflect on the following questions: \u2022 Are we good in originating or holding?", "\u2022 Do we have deep pockets?", "\u2022 Do we find value in continuous turning over, or in holding on without growth?", "\u2022 For diversification, do we build our entire portfolio or acquire a part?", "\u2022 Should we build capacity in all segments of credit or focus on the best suited?", "They also need to be ready to let go.", "Primarily, they should be prepared to parcel out high quality cash flows and share the spoils of good cash flows.", "We as regulators are ever ready to assist financial market development.", "As I understand, initiatives are underway by SEBI to formulate a detailed template mandating disclosure requirements covering granular details of all aspects of securitisation transactions / products.", "Similarly, SEBI is further examining the
