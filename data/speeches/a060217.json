developments.", "If inflation deviates substantially from the target for a period, the interest rate will be set with a view to gradually returning it to the target, so that we avoid substantial variations in output and employment.", "Inflation has varied slightly more in the past few years.", "In a period of increased cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, changes in

increased somewhat, but is still very low, even 21\u20442 years after the cyclical change.", "Inflation is still being restrained by the fall in prices for imported consumer goods, increased competition in a number of markets and the current period of lower nominal pay increases.", "The trend in prices for consumer goods over the past two or three years is a result of favourable developments in the Norwegian and global economies.", "Low inflation is being accompanied by real income growth and a rise in production.", "In other words, low inflation is not the result of declining demand, activity or employment.", "The labour supply and production equipment set a limit in the short term on the level of production in Norwegian enterprises.", "When production approaches this limit, wage and price inflation will pick up.", "For an open economy like Norway's, this limit can vary.", "We buy an increasingly wide range of goods and services abroad.", "The production of

margins.", "Wage growth is still at such a low level that it is strengthening businesses and employment.", "However, we have experienced earlier that cost inflation can rapidly accelerate.", "The settlements in 2004 and 2005 resulted in moderate wage growth.", "There are now signs of higher local pay increases in some industries.", "Pay increments are probably rising in occupations where pay is directly linked to performance.", "Municipalities and public entities have recorded a sharp increase in revenues, and this may easily translate into higher labour costs.", "Nevertheless, the labour market is not so tight that there is a pronounced risk of a marked increase in wage growth in connection with the spring income settlement.", "Moreover, employee organisations have gained acceptance for important changes in labour legislation and regulations.", "This probably reduces the near-term risk of pay increases that weaken production.", "A characteristic of the wage formation process in Norway has been that fairly long periods of moderate nominal pay increases and rising employment have culminated in a sharp rise in cost inflation - often as a result of working hour reforms - and a decline in employment.", "Developments in labour costs and the wage settlements in 1974 and 1975, 1986 and 1987 and in the period between 1998 and 2002 laid the basis for a subsequent decline in output and employment.", "In our interest-rate setting, we must continuously assess how we should take account of the risk of another sharp rise in cost inflation when the labour market tightens.", "In the conduct of monetary policy, we assess the objective of stabilising inflation at close to 21\u20442 per cent over time against the objective of stabilising output and employment.", "Given the low inflation rate, we have decided to keep interest rates at a low level and at times considered an even lower interest rate.", "However, against the background of solid growth in the Norwegian economy since summer 2003, we have instead decided to use some time to bring inflation back to target.", "Household debt has risen sharply since the mid-1990s.", "At the same time, house prices have shown a marked increase.", "Debt developments through the 1990s can probably be viewed to some extent as a delayed adaptation to the deregulation of the housing and credit markets in the 1980s, after many households burned their fingers immediately after the deregulation.", "At the same time, the credit market has deepened.", "New loan products have emerged, and it is easier to raise loans.", "Borrowers can choose their repayment schedule.", "Credit and housing market liberalisation provides homebuyers with the opportunity to establish a high housing standard early in their adult lives and draw on this capital later in life.", "In recent years, household income growth has been solid, household confidence regarding the future has been strong and households probably perceive higher income levels as permanent.", "This may have resulted in a further rise in house prices and debt.", "In addition, low real interest rates are currently contributing to this.", "We have limited scope for restraining structural changes that take place when households increase their debt over several years in order to invest in housing and other property and assets.", "An interest rate level that effectively restrains this restructuring process would also have had adverse effects on economic activity.", "However, households are more vulnerable when debt is high.", "Long periods of sharply rising asset prices and debt may be a source of subsequent instability in production and employment.", "We believe that expectations regarding interest rate developments have a greater impact on household and business borrowing and investment behaviour than actual interest rates.", "Norges Bank communicates its analysis of the outlook for the Norwegian economy and the interest rate.", "At this juncture, the outlook for output and inflation suggests that the interest rate should be gradually - in small, not too frequent steps - brought up to a more normal level.", "The economic outlook

even after the interest rate has increased by 3 percentage points.", "The household with the lowest income will have a tight margin.", "Principal payments will have to be deferred and, even with a deferral of a few years, this household will have little leeway after basic expenses have been paid.", "In order to increase its financial leeway, it will either have to increase its income, or reduce housing consumption and dispose of its debt.", "Both households will be vulnerable should one member lose income from employment and have to rely on benefits.", "With an income loss of 10 per cent, even the household with the highest income level would have to make considerable spending adjustments.", "Although these households have higherthan-average debt, this debt level is not uncommon.",

far not to such a degree that there are visible signs of inflation.", "As long as the rise in prices is slow, it will be appropriate to maintain a low interest rate.", "But when capacity utilisation increases, the interest rate will have to be raised gradually towards a more normal level.", "Even though price inflation has deviated from the target for a period, there are no indications that economic agents have changed their view of future inflation.", "When households and businesses make their saving and investment decisions and set prices, they can safely ignore the possibility of sustained, marked increases or decreases in the general price level.", "The business sector can base their decisions on the assumption that wage and cost inflation will not revert to the level seen in

impede restructuring.", "We learned a great deal about successful - and less successful - restructuring in the 1970s and 1980s.", "Two local communities that had to restructure are Kongsberg and Notodden.", "The cornerstone enterprises in these two communities had to cut their workforces substantially.", "Kongsberg fared well.", "When Kongsberg Va\u030apenfabrikk declared bankruptcy in 1987, its defence business was continued while all its civilian production was split up and sold.", "The new companies and spin-off companies in Horten, Stj\u00f8rdal and Egersund have posted solid growth and profitability.", "Several of the companies have become leaders in their field.", "An adequate supply of state-of-the-art technical expertise has been important for the companies' restructuring

labour.", "The processing industry has now been closed down.", "Many workers are now commuting to other municipalities, including Kongsberg.", "The share of the population that is on disability benefits or participating in various labour market programmes is above the national average.", "The basis for establishing new businesses has not been as favourable as in Kongsberg, but there are now at last signs that the situation is improving.", "Kongsberg Va\u030apenfabrikk was wholly state-owned.", "This was widely perceived as a guarantee for continued operations.", "The company repeatedly required state capital injections following unfavourable results.", "When the government allowed the company to fail, this also represented an important choice with regard to state ownership policy.", "Profit requirements bolstered discipline in the fledgling companies.", "At the same time, when the original company was split up, competencies and values became visible.", "The state still has extensive ownership interests in Norwegian business and industry, but it has adopted a completely different approach to the management of its interests following the experience in Kongsberg, Mo i Rana, Sulitjelma and Syd-Varanger.", "Corporate governance is now exercised through resolutions in general meetings and according to recommendations from nominating committees, and the board and management can run companies with the objective of increasing value.", "The state- owned companies are subject to exactly the same market discipline as other operators, with a required return and continuous adaptation and development.", "This is also the only way companies can avoid stagnation.", "Through the Government Pension Fund, the state owns equities worth more than NOK 500 billion, spread across nearly 3 500 companies in over 30 countries.", "The holdings are minority interests.", "While long-term interests in state-owned companies require ownership discipline and distance from decisionmaking, the challenge to the Pension Fund is to assert its minority interests and contribute to transparent corporate governance.", "Here we can apply internationally recognised principles drawn up by the OECD and the UN.", "Restructuring in state-owned enterprises and the wider business sector has enhanced the efficient use of labour, capital and other resources.", "International comparisons indicate that production in Norway is fairly efficient - also in sectors other than oil and gas.", "A comparison shows that both Norway and Europe were catching up with the US for a while.", "In Norway, productivity showed a particularly strong increase at the beginning of the 1970s.", "Growth was weaker from the mid-1970s and up to the beginning of the 1990s, but has since picked up somewhat again.", "Productivity growth has been weaker in many European countries over the past decade.", "Restructuring in retail trade and the financial industry in particular has progressed at a slower pace in Europe than in the US.", "In this respect, developments in Norway are more similar to developments in the US.", "When productivity growth picked up in Norway, it was primarily in retail trade and the postal, telecom and banking industries.", "Two factors seem to be important for growth: First: In areas and enterprises in decline, adversity can trigger creativity when companies are split up and new owners make their entry.", "Second: In order to reap the benefits of new technology, enterprises must be able to make rapid changes in their workforces.", "However, at a more fundamental level, growth and restructuring capacity is closely linked to the level of skills in a population.", "European surveys indicate that there is a high level of science and technology skills among the adult population.", "Surveys among pupils and students do not provide an equally positive picture.", "A report from the Norwegian Mathematics Council shows that the level of mathematical skills among new university students has declined markedly in recent years.", "Even the top performing students score considerably lower than earlier.", "This is illustrated here as the percentage of correct answers in arithmetic and percent calculation, but we find similar scores for other mathematical skills.", "Norway is taking an economic risk in allowing the skills level to decline.", "But - to take a brighter view of this: We have after all experienced that negative trends can be reversed in very important areas of society.", "Our most important resource is our labour force.", "The employment rate is high in Norway.", "This is because many wish to participate in working life, and the vast majority find a job.", "However, the Norwegian labour market also has its weak points.", "The annual number of person-years worked is lower in Norway than in the US and the rest of Europe.", "Both in Norway and the rest of Europe, the fall in the number of working hours is ascribable to longer holidays and shorter working days.", "The standard working year is short in Norway, but on the other hand Norway also has a higher percentage of part-time employees than other countries.", "Access to these working hour arrangements has made it easier for women and young workers to enter the labour market.", "The income level in Norway has increased.", "Many may prefer to take advantage of this by increasing their leisure time in the form of shorter working days or longer holidays.", "And this has in fact taken place.", "Moreover, the retirement age is steadily declining.", "The expected retirement age is now below 60, when disability pensioners are taken into account.", "At the same time, life expectancy has increased, and leisure time accounts for an increasing share of our lives.", "The large post-war cohorts will only reach ordinary retirement age after 2012, but are now nearing the age when they are eligible for early retirement.", "If they opt to retire under the scheme as it functions today, the number of pensioners under the contractual early retirement scheme will increase by 16 000 in six years.", "Similarly, the ageing of the population will result in an additional 41 000 disability pensioners.", "The incentives embedded in pension rules, benefits and taxes encourage early retirement.", "The pension rules make it costly for companies to recruit older workers.", "The wage trend perceived by a wage-earner as appropriate over a lifetime may also deviate from the trend in work capacity expected by the employer.", "The basic problem seems to be that individuals are not sufficiently exposed to the social costs associated with leisure and early retirement.", "Nor are the right incentives offered to individual businesses.", "Saving and returns in the Government Pension Fund Our labour force is clearly our most important national resource, but Norway also has substantial petroleum wealth.", "The state's share consists partly of the value of oil and gas under the seabed and partly of the financial wealth accumulated in the Government Pension Fund - Global.", "It is misleading to look upon the cash flow from petroleum activities as income.", "The appropriate economic perspective is to see the transfer of the cash flow to the Government Pension Fund as a way of transferring capital from one account to another - from petroleum to foreign securities.", "By doing so, we diversify risk.", "We are in a period marked by high oil and gas production and high prices.", "Substantial resources are therefore transferred from the one account to the other.", "Combined with high returns, the result is that the value of the Government Pension Fund is rising rapidly and may continue to do so in the years ahead.", "The Fund is now approaching the nominal value of one year's GDP and may reach two in the course of the next decade.", "This is based on the assumption that oil prices remain high over the next few years and then fall to about USD 30 per barrel.", "Experience has shown that forecasts for both oil production and oil prices are highly uncertain.", "The government bases its withdrawals from the Fund on an average real return of 4 per cent for financing current expenditure.", "Given this spending rule, the return may come to finance more than 15 per cent of government expenditure in 10 years.", "We thus reap considerable benefits from managing our petroleum wealth well.", "The return represents future income that we forego if we draw on this wealth today.", "But even with this source of income, more than 80 per cent of expenditure must be covered by other sources.", "Financing the large pension payments that will have to be disbursed after 2012 will be very demanding in any event.", "The Government Pension Fund has a prudent investment strategy, with broad risk diversification, and a real return of 4 per cent is expected in the long term.", "There are examples of companies and investors that achieve a considerably higher return on capital over time.", "However, it is important to remember that for each successful investor earning high returns, there are many others with the same ambition and risk willingness, but with a record of poorer performance and bankruptcies.", "The Government Pension Fund cannot run the risk of ending up among the worst performers.", "The globalisation of financial markets provides the Fund with good opportunities for investing and diversifying risk.", "However, we cannot insulate the Fund from wide annual swings in the value of the investments.", "We invest in international equity markets where prices fluctuate widely.", "These fluctuations are the reason why equity investments generate a higher return over time.", "The best year in the Fund's history so far was 2003, when it posted a real return of 11 per cent.", "This stood in sharp contrast to the previous year's result, which was -6 per cent.", "The use of the Fund's return must therefore be smoothed over time in order to prevent events in international capital markets from spreading to the Norwegian economy.", "Conclusion In the character of Peer Gynt, Ibsen drew a rather unflattering portrait of the Norwegian man who travelled out into the world and became rich - but who had no concern for others.", "At the end of the play, Peer is penniless.", "Ibsen himself left Norway, and although the Norwegian landscape and his Norwegian identity were at the core of his writing, it was his encounter with other ideas and thinking that
