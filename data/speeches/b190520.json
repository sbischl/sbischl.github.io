as was the case for example back in 2010.", "On the contrary, a low inflation environment is perceived as one of the key factors of a stable business environment in our country.", "Further, relative stability of the exchange rate, the mentioned results on the fiscal front, as well as in many other areas as part of stabilisation agenda, are perceived as vital for FDI attraction.", "This is all confirmed by many studies, such as World Bank study from 2018 showing that countries with lower exchange rate and inflation volatility had higher FDIs in terms of GDP.", "Not to forget, in terms of FDIs attraction, of outmost importance is also political stability.", "The same is assessed by Moody's rating agency in their latest yearly report, stating that Serbia clearly ranks above the countries with the same rating, when it comes to political stability and government effectiveness.", "In such environment foreign investors are rather reinvesting their profit in Serbia, than sending it back.", "On average - around 60% of profit is being reinvested.", "I believe that the integration in infrastructure flows, the latest technological projects and innovations, in line with our potentials, are the basis for Serbia's growth.", "At the same time, this is the basis for investment.", "And our potentials are geographic position and work force.", "Anyone offering a partnership in this context is welcome.", "It is up to us to provide macroeconomic stability and equal treatment for all investors.", "We do not have the privilege or the reason to measure this by any other criterion, but the interest of our citizens in better living standards and sustainable growth.", "And investments diversified by country and branch, are the guarantee to the achievement of our goals which are written in all the preambles of the most reputable and the most significant international institutions.", "Of course, we can always do more.", "Each one of us present here.", "Therefore, allow me to quote a message stated in the Joint Conclusions: \"Across the region, further efforts are needed to tackle corruption, improve the rule of law and strengthen institutions in order to promote competitiveness\".", "I strongly believe that this goes beyond candidate countries and refers to all."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Foreign direct investment", "Inflation", "Economic growth", "Structural reforms", "Monetary policy", "Price stability", "Political stability", "Exchange rate", "Corruption", "Rule of law"]}
