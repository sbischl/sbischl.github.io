{"sentences": ["Thank you for this opportunity to appear here today.", "Recent economic and financial developments Monetary Policy Report In recent weeks, several downside risks to the Bank's July (MPR) projection have been realised.", "The European sovereign crisis has intensified, the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded, and a broad range of data has signalled slower global growth.", "The United States is in the midst of the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.", "This is not a surprise as history teaches that recessions involving financial crises tend to be more severe and

businesses.", "Recent events serve as a reminder that in a world awash with debt, repairing the balance sheets of banks, households and countries will take years.", "As a consequence, the pace, pattern and variability of global economic growth is changing, and Canada must adapt.", "In short, the considerable external headwinds that the Bank has long identified are now blowing harder.", "For Canadian producers, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar is compounding the sluggishness of U.S. demand.", "Largely reflecting such external factors, recent Canadian data has been consistent

"The Bank continues to expect that growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, led by business investment and household expenditures.", "Ongoing strength in major emerging markets should also help maintain commodity prices at relatively high levels.", "However, relative to our prior expectations, we expect somewhat weaker economic momentum globally and, as a result, in Canada, with

likely path of our target rate, through our conditional commitment.", "In tandem, federal and provincial fiscal stimulus provided important further support to domestic demand, contributing

external environment.", "First, the best contribution that monetary policy can make is to keep inflation low, stable and predictable.", "Monetary policy is guided by our 2 per cent target for total CPI inflation.", "This is a symmetric commitment.", "That is, the Bank cares as much about inflation being below target as above.", "Since the crisis erupted, the Bank has demonstrated its flexibility and nimbleness in the conduct of monetary policy.", "As the Canadian recovery has progressed, we have emphasised that we would be prudent with respect to the possible withdrawal of any degree of monetary stimulus.", "As we highlighted in our most recent MPR, our approach will always be guided by comprehensive, considered analysis and informed judgment rather than mechanical rules.", "This is particularly important in the current environment of material external headwinds.", "To state the obvious, if the outlook for growth and inflation changes, the path for monetary policy will be affected accordingly.", "Second, the Bank will take the necessary steps to ensure that core funding markets remain liquid.", "In the event of a major systemic shock, the Bank has a wide range of tools to provide exceptional liquidity, consistent with a principles-based framework.", "At the same time, central bank liquidity should not be a substitute for sound risk management by private financial

maintain adequate liquidity buffers.", "Third, we must continue to build a more resilient financial system in Canada and globally.", "Recent events underscore the importance of implementing G-20

tackle the twin challenges of reducing excessive private and public debt.", "The situation is most acute in Europe where credible national fiscal plans need to be supplemented by broader changes to European economic governance and fiscal arrangements.", "We are in constant, intensive discussions with our European colleagues bilaterally and through the G-7, the G-20, the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board.", "As the Bank has stressed repeatedly, the core challenge is to rebalance demand between advanced and emerging economies.", "To this end, the Bank is investing in current G-20 efforts to develop a framework for open capital flows, working with the FSB to devise and implement comprehensive financial reforms, and collaborating with our colleagues in the Department of Finance to guide the G-20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.", "Rebalancing will require significant changes to fiscal, structural and exchange rate policies across a broad range of countries.", "To conclude, the challenges in the current global economic environment are significant, but so too are the opportunities for Canada.", "Our corporations and
