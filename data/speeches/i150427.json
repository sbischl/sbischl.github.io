significant cross-border financial, information and talent flows.", "My remarks today will touch on three key areas: the current challenges confronting the global and domestic economy in this new

pressing challenge, therefore for the global economy, is to generate an economic recovery that is balanced and sustainable.", "Although the growth momentum has improved in a number of major economies, the growth has thus far been modest.", "In addition, weaknesses in several major economies continue to point to a global economy that remains vulnerable to downside risks.", "While the growth performance in most emerging economies is projected to moderate, collectively emerging market economies remain an important driver of growth of the world economy.", "A less robust external sector, slower domestic demand and specific domestic factors are amongst the reasons for this growth performance.", "In Asia, the growth for 2015 is projected to be sustained at 6.4%, while growth in the ASEAN-5 is projected to be in the region of 5%.", "A further phenomenon affecting the global economic performance is the significant decline in global oil prices.", "While this has partially offset the weaker-than-expected growth momentum in some of the advanced countries, it has, in different degrees, adversely affected the oil exporting economies resulting in divergent growth performance across and within regions.", "Overall, however, the global economy is expected to benefit from the lower oil prices.", "A further recent development is the consequences of the unprecedented and divergent monetary policies being pursued in the major economies which have now resulted in significant policy spillovers to other parts of the world.", "Against this backdrop, the financial markets

these global developments.", "These effects, however, need to be seen from the perspective of our underlying conditions.", "Malaysia is affected by these external developments through trade and capital flows.", "The diversified structure of our economy and of our exports has reduced the impact of the effects of the plummeting oil prices on the economy.", "While the current account of the balance of payments is expected to narrow, it is projected to remain in surplus.", "The global shifts in liquidity have caused sizeable outflows from emerging economies, including Malaysia, resulting in volatility in our financial markets and depreciations in our currencies.", "Despite these developments, after a stellar performance in 2014, the economy is projected to remain on a steady growth

resilience is the best line of defense to deal with the spillovers from external developments and on future shocks.", "Malaysia has, over several decades demonstrated time and time again, the ability to emerge from commodity price shocks, financial crisis and spill overs from disruptions generated from other parts of the world.", "While Malaysia will always be affected by such external

features that have allowed Malaysia to rapidly recover from such shocks.", "For each respective major shock confronting our economy, Malaysia has registered V-shaped recoveries.", "This has

diversified in terms of sources of growth.", "While the export sector remains an integral component of our economy, domestic demand has now become the key driver of growth, anchored by strong private

account is expected to remain positive, sustained by manufactured exports while the financial account is expected to adjust in an orderly manner.", "During this same period, the financial sector restructuring, rationalisation and reforms, the institutional development, the strengthening of the regulatory, supervisory and legal framework and the development of the domestic financial markets have also diversified the financial sector and has enhanced its ability to disperse external shocks throughout the system.", "In particular, the financial reforms also involved the transition to greater market orientation and more liberalised financial system which has allowed for greater flexibility to adjust to the effects of shifts in global liquidity.", "The now deep and robust financial system is also underpinned by high levels of capitalisation and sufficient levels of liquidity.", "This has ensured that financial intermediation continues to be effective in providing support to economic activity.", "It is therefore not the recent policies nor the new measures that have placed Malaysia on a stronger position to manage the external challenges.", "Rather it is the economic restructuring and financial reforms and development undertaken during the recent two decades and the building of several layers of buffers that has allowed us to weather the current challenging operating environment.", "Further solid fundamentals include the relatively low rate of inflation, the low levels of unemployment, the high rate of savings and the manageable levels of external debt with the majority of debt in medium- to long-term tenures and with more than 40% of the external debt being denominated in ringgit.", "This, together with the ample international reserves, accords the economy with the policy flexibility to manage external risks.", "The combination of these factors will cumulatively enable a more effective policy response to mitigate the impact of any external shocks on domestic demand.", "While monetary policy has remained accommodative and access to financing has been enhanced, wide-ranging measures including macro prudential and tax measures have been implemented to rein in excessive leverage and excessive risk-taking to ensure growth is achieved without compromising our future prospects.", "Malaysia's new investment landscape As Malaysia

from basic production and assembly to producing goods which have advance applications such as in the automotive and healthcare sectors.", "As a country which is strategically located within close radius of two of the most populous economies in the world, China and India, Malaysia is centrally located in Asia, more broadly, and in ASEAN, in particular.", "With the conception of the ASEAN
