OECD.", "The GDP gaps of 2010 and 2011 according to both of these institutions can be disregarded, as their reports were compiled before the summer and, since then, GDP outcomes have been surprisingly high.", "In its latest report, the IMF reckons with a GDP gap of approximately 2.5 per cent for 2007, followed by a decrease to almost - 5 per cent in 2009 before reaching - 1.5 per cent in 2011.8 (Figure 5.", "The GDP gap according to the Riksbank, the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission).", "All three organisations reckon that potential GDP has fallen in conjunction with the crisis.", "For example, the OECD estimates that potential GDP has decreased by an average of approximately 3 per cent for the countries in the OECD area, as a consequence of the crisis.", "Approximately two-thirds of this decrease is due to higher capital costs caused by the return to normal risk and interest rate levels after the abnormally low levels prevailing prior to the crisis, which is having a dampening effect on capital intensity.", "The remaining third is due to an increase in structural unemployment and a decrease in labour supply.", "As regards Sweden, the dampening effects of structural unemployment and falling labour supply are deemed to be below average, however.", "Another question is whether long-term GDP growth has fallen as a result of the crisis.", "Experiences from previous financial crises indicate that there frequently is a connection.", "However, in the report mentioned, the OECD writes that it does not expect any decline in long-term GDP-growth (after 2015) due to the crisis.", "The OECD sta tes that it will indeed decline, but as a result of demographic developments.", "At the Riksbank, the crisis has not led us to make any new assessment of the long-term GDP growth used in our models.", "We expect long-term GDP growth to be just above two per cent per year.", "Resource utilisation can also be measured in the labour market by, for instance, the employment rate , unemployment, the employment gap and the hours gap.", "The employment gap and the hours gap have been estimated with the aid of HP trends and are thus subject to the problems entailed by such estimates.", "In contrast, the employment rate and unemployment are not associated with the same type of technical problems, but here it is instead difficult to know what can be considered to be normal levels for the respective variables.", "In the Figure, they have been included as deviations from the average in 2000-2007, without taking a stance on which levels should be considered normal.", "They may have been affected both by the reforms made and by the deep recession.", "These are, of course, important issues to be addressed, but I will not go into them today.", "The various labour market gaps co-vary for natural reasons.", "However, the employment rate, the employment gap and the hours gap reach zero at the start of 2011 and are faintly positive for the rest of the forecast period, while unemployment is above average over the entire forecast period.", "It is common for unemployment to increase rapidly in a deep recession and decrease slowly during the recovery.", "However, it is also possible that we are underestimating the strength of the recovery in the labour marke t - as, indeed, we have done recently.", "It can also be noted that the positive deviations from the average are of the same magnitude in 2007 as they were at the previous peak in 2001.", "The National Institute of Economic Research's Economic Tendency Survey can also be used to describe resource utilisation.", "There exists a clear connection between various variabl es in the Survey.", "For example, companies' planned price increases co-vary with the other variables, for example shortage of labour.", "Indicators for the business sector).", "However, most of these reported variables are ones that show changes.", "This is true of demand, for example.", "The question is whether it is expected to become better or worse.", "Consequently, these variables are not good measures of the level of resource utilisation, but rather of whether this is increasing or decreasing.", "However, the business tendency surveys also include variables that measure levels.", "For example, this applies to the shortage of labour in the business sector and capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry.", "These have both increased recently and it canno t be ruled out that these will reach normal levels by the end of this year.", "Shortage of labour in the business sector and capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry).", "It is also interesting to compare shortage of labour with unemployment.", "These co-varied significantly before the crisis.", "However, shortage of labour is now increasing more rapidly than unemployment is falling.", "This indicates that there may be significant matching problems in the labour market long before unemployment comes down to a normal level.", "Shortage of labour in the business sector and unemployment).", "At the Riksbank, we have also developed a special indicator to measure resource utilisation, the so-called RU indicator.", "This uses a principal component method to extract common information from a large number of business cycle indicators in levels.", "The RU indicator also indicates that resource utilisation in Sweden was about as high in 200 7 as at the previous peak in 2000.", "This contrasts with the GDP gap based on HP trends, which was much higher in 2007 than in 2000.", "The GDP gap and the RU indicator).", "An indication of the significance of the crisis for potential industrial production can also be obtained by combining statistics on industrial production and capacity utilisation.", "Industrial production fell by a maximum amount of 24 per cent from its peak in the first quarter of 2008 to its lowest point in the second quarter of 2009.", "Potential industrial production fell by 14 per cent with a time lag of two to three quarters and by approximately 20 per cent in relation to the previous trend.", "Such a fall in potential industrial production could explain a fall of approximately 4 per cent in potential GDP, as the level of value added in the manufacturing industry was equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of GDP prior to the crisis.",

give different results.", "This is particularly difficult right now due to the financial crisis and the deep recession from which we are emerging.", "At the Riksbank we are continuing to work with these issues and expect to take up resource utilisation in more detail in the next Monetary Policy Report in October.", "Uncertainty surrounding resource utilisation also makes it difficult to assess whether or not monetary policy is well-balanced.", "My own assessment is that resource utilisation was more or less as high before the crisis as during the previous boom in 2000 and that the GDP gap was thus in the range of + 2 per cent in 2007.", "Here, I assume that the GDP gap based on HP trends provides a reliable measure of the GDP gap for 2000 and that other series, for example the RU indicator, indicate that the level of resource utilisation was approximately the same in 2007 as in 2000.", "I also assess that potential GDP decreased by approximately 4 per cent in conjunction with the crisis.", "This is slightly above the OECD's calculations, but the OECD has only calculated the effect of certain identified changes within the framework of a production function.", "It has not considered other possible effects of the crisis on potential GDP, such as, for example, an abnormally high level of capital consumption.", "Swedish experiences of previous deep recessions and international experiences of financial crises both indicate that the effects can be greater.", "The difference from the GDP forecasts we made before and after the fall of GDP in 2009, as well as estimates of the manufacturing sector's potential production also indicate an effect of approximately 4 per cent.", "I also think that this reduction in potential GDP should be ascribed to the recession of 2009, rather than being spread out over a longer period of time before and after the recession.", "This means that the GDP gap was approximately - 4 per cent when the crisis was most severe in 2009.", "Instead of increasing according to trend by over 4 per cent between 2007 and 2009, GDP fell by 5.5 per cent.", "This resulted in a fall in actual GDP of approximately 10 per cent in relation to the trend.", "However, potential GDP also fell as a result of the crisis by around 4 per cent.", "This means that the GDP gap only fell by around 6 per cent.", "The level of the GDP gap is significant for monetary policy.", "A large negative gap indicates inflationary pressures can be expected to be low and that there are more compelling reasons to support production and employment through an expansionary monetary policy.", "My assessments indicate that the GDP gap was lower before the crisis than appears from a GDP gap based on HP trends.", "HP gaps do not work well as measures of resource utilisation in deep recessions.", "However, despite this, my own assessment corresponds fairly well with the level that the HP gap indicates for 2009.", "It is also compatible with current forecasts indicating that the GDP gap should be largely normal by the end of the forecast p eriod.", "Total GDP growth for the three years 2010-2012 is just above 10 per cent, which is four percentage points more than growth according to trend of just above 6 per cent.", "What does resource utilisation mean to inflation and current monetary policy?", "Previously, I said that the Riksbank also strives to stabilise production and employment around development paths that are sustainable in the long term, and that by potential GDP I mean the level of GDP that is compatible with a utilisation of available resources sustainable in the long term and that will not push inflation up or down.", "As you know, the target for monetary policy is to keep inflation at a low and stable level.", "However, one problem when shaping m onetary policy in practical terms is that the link between resource utilisation and inflation is not particularly clear.", "I will now discuss what resource utilisation means to inflation.", "In Sweden, the link between resource utilisation and inflation has been weaker since the mid1990s than it was previously.", "This is due to the fact that monetary policy has gained a high level of credibility.", "As long-term inflation expectations among households and companies are now solidly anchored around the inflation target of 2 per cent, there is simply not much scope for other variables to affect inflation.", "However, it is also due to the fact that inflation is affected by many other factors than resource utilisation, such as variations in energy prices, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates.", "However, the fact that it is difficult to estimate stable links between resource utilisation and inflation using econometric methods does not mean that these links do not exist.", "International experience indicates that minor variations in resource utilisation in normal times do not significantly affect inflation, but that a very low level of resource utilisation noticeably dampens inflation.", "In the current crisis, with a very low level of resource utilisation in the United States and the eurozone, underlying inflation has fallen from normal levels of around 2 per cent to around 1 per cent.", "As far as Sweden is concerned, it appears that, despite everything, there is a relatively strong link between u nderlying inflation and resource utilisation measured using the RU indicator with a time lag of one to two years.", "The RU indicator and HICP inflation excluding energy14).", "In Sweden, underlying inflation measured in terms of the CPIF (the CPI with a fixed mortgage rate) has stayed at, and even above, 2 per cent over the last two years despite the fall in resource utilisation.", "This is probably related to the substantial weakening of the krona in the most acute phase of the crisis.", "This contributed to rising import prices measured in Swedish kronor, which kept up inflation.", "The krona has now strengthened again and is more or less back to its pre-crisis level against the euro, and CPIF inflation has fallen back to below 2 per cent.", "CPI and CPIF inflation).", "During the forecast period, we expect CPIF inflation to first fall to around 1 per cent, but then to rise again to around 2 per cent at the end of the forecast period.", "CP I inflation fell dramatically during the crisis as a result of our repo rate cuts, but it will increase to a level higher than CPIF inflation as we increase the repo rate to a more normal level.", "When we compare various measures of resource utilisation with the forecasts we make for inflation in the latest Monetary Policy Update, the following picture emerges.", "Underlying inflation measured in terms of the CPIF begins to rise in 2011.", "By that time, resource utilisation measured in terms of variables such as the RU indicator, shortage of labour in the business sector, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry, the employment rate and the HP trend-based measures the employment gap and the hours gap will probably already have risen to above-normal levels.", "Underlying CPIF inflation will then rise to 2 per cent at the end of the forecast period.", "Resource utilisation measured using the GDP gap based on HP trends will then have reached a normal level.", "The HP gap will then be more or less zero.", "My own assessment is also that the GDP gap will then have reached the zero level.", "However, even by the end of the forecast period, unemployment will not have reached the average level in the years before the crisis.", "Our forecasts thus paint a rather complex picture.", "There is no simple link between one measure of resource utilisation and one measure of inflation.", "Resource utilisation can instead be measured in several ways, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses.", "Inflation can also be measured in a number of ways and we regularly utilise a large number of measures of underlying inflation.", "In this multi-faceted world, we make the best assessments we can of the direction of monetary policy.", "At the latest monetary policy meeting on 1 September, we decided to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75 per cent, and our assessment was that the repo rate will gradually be increased to more normal levels as resource utilisation increases.", "The repo rate will nevertheless be abnormally low for some time to come in order to support the recovery in the economy.", "I supported the forecast for the repo rate made in the latest Monetary Policy Update - a forecast that I believe is well in line with the picture of a stable economic upturn in Sweden.", "For my part, I have felt very convinced of two things, which I clearly explained in the most recent minutes.", "Firstly, we ought to increase the repo rate in the months ahead, as the Swedish economy is developing so strongly.", "Resource utilisation is increasing, which will increase inflationary pressures over time.", "We should therefore ease up in order to avoid excessive inflation in the period ahead.", "Secondly, the long-term repo rate should be approximately 4 per cent, corresponding to inflation of 2 per cent and a real interest ra te of 2 per cent.", "The latter figure is what the short real interest rate on government bonds has been, on average, in both the United States and the eurozone for long periods of time.", "On the other hand, it is difficult to have a definite opinion of what the repo rate ought to be in two or three years.", "Neither our own nor the market's forecasting abilities are sufficient to make solid forecasts over such a period.", "Among other reasons, the repo rate will be dependent upon developments in the eurozone and in the United States, and the impact these may have on the Swedish economy.", "Weaker international development could entail weaker development in Swe den and a lower repo rate path in the long term.", "However, stronger development of the Swedish labour market could entail higher inflationary pressures and a higher repo rate path.", "Despite this uncertainty, my view is that we should report the assumptions we make about the repo rate in conjunction with our forecasts.", "It would be remarkable if we reported all other circumstances surrounding the forecasts except the repo rate itself, which is the only one of these we take decisions on.", "Furthermore, it would not be wise to base our forecasts on the market's forward rate curve in those cases in which our assessment of the repo rate - as at present - deviates from the forward rate curve.", "We are also careful to point out that the repo rate is a forecast and not a promise.", "However, our possibilities of steering interest rates further ahead on the repo rate path are highly limited.", "What we can do is to communicate our own assessment, which is also associated with great uncertainty.", "The statistics that have been reported after the most recent Monetary Policy Update indicate a stronger development in Sweden than we had expected.", "According to the National Accounts from September, GDP growth was more rapid in the second quarter of 2010 than was reported in August's flash estimate.", "The Economic Tendency Survey and purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector in September were positive and exceeded market expectations.", "According to the Labour Force Survey, unemployment fell in August by slightly more than we had expected.", "As regards international developments, however, the
