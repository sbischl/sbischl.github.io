be it in business or financial sector; be it government or household sectors, use of ICT is pervasive; even as mundane as switching a light is today executed by use of ICT; in addition, networked devices are now the norm.", "New concepts such as centralised processing systems, the Internet of things and mobile computing have all made life very easy; but this also has the attendant risks, prime among which is cyber security.", "The Financial system which is at the nerve centre of economic activity is an easy target not only because it is one of the largest users of Information and Communications Technology but also because financial crime results in easy access to money;
