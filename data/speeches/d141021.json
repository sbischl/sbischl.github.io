little more on the fourth pillar- corporate accountability.", "Not just because as a banker accountability looms large in my mind but also because as ex-CAG, Vinod Rai stated, \"Accountability cannot be regulated or relegated to the background in pursuit of power.", "Every institution must be held accountable.\"", "The ever-growing impact of business on society means that citizens and consumers expect corporate power to be exerted responsibly and the corporate needs to show that this is so, which is where the concept of accountability comes in.", "Explanation of corporate accountability 26.", "In the corporate world, there are many different accountability relationships, but the relevant one in the context of corporate sustainability is the relationship between corporate management and stakeholders.", "This relationship is an extension of the traditional fiduciary model, which in turn is based on agency theory and agency law, wherein corporate management is the \"agent\" and the stakeholders are the \"principal\".", "This relationship can be viewed as a contract in which the principal entrusts the agent with resources and the agent is responsible for using those resources in the principal's best interest.", "The agent is also held accountable by the principal for how those resources are used and the return on investment.", "All of you must be following the latest news.", "It is full of stories of corporate \"disaccountability\" (if I may coin a new word).", "So much so that judicial activism has taken on a new meaning in our country.", "In this environment some sterling corporates have set new benchmarks of corporate accountability.", "While the act of withdrawing cars from the market after discovering manufacturing defects by large corporates is laudable, such an act by a cash strapped organisation with a diverse and very poor and illiterate membership, like that of SEWA, with far lesser staying power, shows tremendous commitment towards accountability to stakeholders.", "Companies enter into contracts (both explicit and implicit) with various stakeholder groups as a matter of everyday business and these contractual arrangements can serve as the basis for accountability relationships.", "For example, companies that receive environmental permits and approvals from regulators to operate facilities are often held accountable by the regulators for whether the terms of the approval are being met.", "Proponents of social contract theory suggest that corporations are given a \"license to operate\" by society in exchange for good behaviour, (read judicious utilisation of resources) and as such the corporations should be accountable to society for their performance.", "The contribution of corporate accountability theory to corporate sustainability is that it helps define the nature of the relationship between corporate managers and the rest of society.", "It also sets out the arguments as to why companies should report on their environmental, social, and economic performance, not just financial performance.", "In 1997, John Elkington of the UK consultancy, Sustain Ability, called this type of accounting on environmental, social, and economic performance as \"triple bottom line\" reporting.", "An example of this kind of \"triple bottom line\" reporting would be Infosys which voluntarily made all disclosures in the public domain leading to greater corporate accountability after the Satyam scam.", "Let me talk about my own organisation for a while.", "While there is no prescription by any authority as regards balance sheet disclosures by the Reserve Bank of India, as a commitment towards transparency and building trust, our Annual Report (2013-14) has an entire chapter on the Central Bank's vision for the coming year.", "The RBI is one of the few Central Banks across the globe which has taken upon itself the mandate for developmental banking- be it financial inclusion, training of bankers to render better customer service and not only providing reporting software to banks but also training on how to use these packages for best output.", "Apart from these, several initiatives have been taken by the RBI in improving transparency, be it administration of interest rates in commercial deals or reporting in balance sheets.", "In addition to this the Bank has taken upon itself the corporate social responsibility of financial literacy and apart from its core functions, each major department of the Bank undertakes different kinds of outreach activities towards building financial literacy in the country's populace - from Town Hall meetings to exhibitions and quiz competitions.", "The Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI), is also an initiative of RBI towards accountability by the entire banking system, by preparing, developing, promoting and publishing comprehensive Codes and Standards for banks and for providing for fair treatment to their customers as also to function as an independent and autonomous body to monitor and ensure that the Codes and Standards adopted by banks are adhered to, in letter and spirit, while delivering services to their customers.", "So far I have talked about the corporate sector in the general sense.", "Being a representative of the financial sector, that too, being a central banker, let me dwell a bit more about this sector.", "The financial sector is in a way different from the general corporate sector as the operation of balance sheet is different.", "An efficient financial sector is essential to a well-functioning economy.", "Therefore, it should serve in improving the efficiency of the economy as well as increasing its productivity.", "In other words, it should be a means to the real economy.", "According to Stiglitz, the financial sector has, in general, a very straightforward set of tasks: Firstly, it has to allocate capital, i.e.", "making sure that capital goes to areas where its return is highest.", "Secondly, it should manage risks in a way that, using the ability to absorb risk, it allows capital to go where higher return on investments can be made.", "Thirdly, it is also supposed to perform these tasks efficiently - therefore, at a relatively low cost.", "It is now imperative to ask the question as to whether the laws of the financial markets work towards sustainable development.", "Or is there any conflict?", "Firstly, while sustainable development aims to increase the opportunities on a longer time horizon i.e., both present and future, the financial sector mainly strives for the short-term maximisation of financial profits and the return on investment.", "The pursuit of such a shortterm objective goes against the basic tenets of sustainable development which aims at assessing the impact of today's decision making on the future generations.", "Where are the global banks of 80s and 90s today?", "Some of the large ones which survived are now facing reputational risk with questions being raised by investors and regulators on money laundering and absence of governance culture.", "One of the main reasons for this kind of behaviour is that investors can maximise financial return on their investment and may not directly be exposed to the consequences of their actions on the society or environment as a whole.", "Insider trading and colluding with corporate customers for short term profits on treasuries have down-sized many large financial conglomerates when the regulators catch up with their pace.", "For example, Investors in petroleum companies can gain attractive shortterm returns from high oil prices.", "However, carbon emissions will have an impact on the longterm health of the economy as well as the environment.", "But what about the role of the large merchant bankers and financial institutions who invested in these companies?", "Secondly, the indifference towards environment by the financial sector arises for two main reasons.", "First, as we have seen, it is only interested in the maximisation of financial profits through high turnover and does not have a real concern in the quality of its investments but so long as they are profitable investments.", "This means that there is no ethical consideration of investments, or no consideration of \"bad\" externalities in the calculation of financial profits.", "Further, accounting and reporting systems do not adequately convey potential environmental risks and therefore, financial markets are compelled to make decisions on exposures based on biased information.", "Thirdly, though financial markets are supposed to help to manage risks and deal with uncertainty, it is also true that higher turnover and enlarging risks leads to higher profits.", "As a result, one may get attracted to short-term financial profits irrespective of the risks associated with it and its effects on the real economy and society can be completely ignored; for instance, in terms of job loss, company closures or systemic problems to the whole economy like what happened after global financial crisis.", "Therefore unlike corporates, the financial sector is more prone to take higher risks.", "Fourthly, this sector is characterised by a great deal of sophistication and specialisation and tests the players' abilities for making investment decisions in a very short time in a highly competitive environment.", "Furthermore, the highly complex financial instruments also add to the information asymmetry and participative and informed decision making.", "How the international banking community is addressing the issue?", "The international banking industry has increased focus on sustainable development and has concerns over potential environmental liability and damage to reputation.", "A bank could be held for the environmental degradation that occurred as a result of its lending practices.", "Banks are held responsible for the environmental impacts associated with projects for which they provided funding.", "American banks were reportedly the first to consider the implementation of environmental policies in relation to lender liability, including implementing some form of assessment of environmental factors before approving commercial loans.", "In fact, the Multilateral funding agencies such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation have also played a significant role in the development of social lending and investment guidelines by focussing on: a) Development and integration of credit risk assessment tools: due to the potential liability issues associated with environmental risks, many large international banks have adopted lending practices which involve screening credit applications based on environmental criteria.", "b) environmental reporting and management guidelines: many initiatives regarding environmental information and reporting requirements have been widely supported by this sector including the UNEP Financial Initiative, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and more recently, the environmental management and reporting guidelines by the \"Forge Group\" in the UK.", "c) Issue of climate change: Another driver that has influenced how the credit and lending sector responded to the issue of sustainable development has been that of climate change.", "Banks initial interest in climate change was prompted by a need to better understand the implications for credit risk in their own lending activities, that is, the extent to which companies' profitability and asset valuations would be negatively impacted and therefore impair their credit risks.", "However, there is limited evidence to show that lending terms have been tightened for companies exposed to carbon liabilities.", "So, what is described in the \"good governance\" framework of a corporate as \"effective and efficient\" also covers the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment.", "However, for the financial sector, being effective and efficient means that it should serve the economy by increasing its efficiency and its productivity (hence its effectiveness).", "Therefore to include the sustainable development perspective into finance, the different aspects which would have to be considered are: (i) internalisation of externalities in the calculation of an investment (ii) assigning a long-term horizon to investments so as to safeguard the financial capital for the future; (iii) greater use of sustainability ratios, and (iv) a changing perspective on the connotation of financial profits.", "Concluding remarks 42.", "For business, environmental, social and governance responsibilities are no longer add-ons.", "They are integral to success.", "While the great majority of companies have yet to commit to this trajectory, there is a strong upward growth curve in actively engaged companies, with a vanguard taking serious action in all key markets.", "Companies that have been able to convert sustainability challenges into opportunities are the ones that are most likely to thrive.", "The growing feeling is that corporate sustainability has drawn a line in the sand, and it's best for business to get on the right side.", "I would like to conclude with a quote \"What we possess is temporary, but what we become is permanent.\"", "(Devdutta
