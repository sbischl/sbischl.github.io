banks' exposures to transition- related risks were slightly reduced between 2015 and 2017 and now represent roughly 12% of credit risk's exposures at default.", "Our supervisor also has a clearer view on the blind spots in the risk management framework, which must be addressed: executive bodies are committed to embracing further climate risks at the highest level of decision-making but the degree of implication across the French financial sector is still heterogeneous;
