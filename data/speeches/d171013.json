would actively seek out opportunities to assist aspiring entrepreneurs that may be struggling to obtain funds, but have business models that, despite being untested, are more socially responsible or green in nature.", "VBI therefore considers a broader spectrum of criteria as opposed to the traditional method that places emphasis on credit history and availability of collaterals.", "VBI also promotes more holistic offerings for entrepreneurs and I would like to suggest several examples to illustrate -

\"process inefficiencies\" - that can contribute to higher operational risks such as fraud.", "This can be mitigated through use of technology that reduces reliance on traditionally document-intensive and multi-tiered manual processes.", "In Malaysia, I am happy to note that six Islamic banks have embarked on digitalisation of trade finance processes -
