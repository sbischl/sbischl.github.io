a reminder of the costs of disorderly transition.", "But we cannot ignore the broader challenges.", "The fallout of this crisis and the near-term imperative to tackle energy security issues has reduced bandwidth to address other issues.", "This is a good segue to my third challenge.", "The third challenge is that it is difficult, but essential, for real economy and financial firms to make transition-driven business decisions in the absence of complete clarity on our pathway to net zero.", "It is easy for me to stand here and tell you that you should be making decisions now that stretch many years into the future, to manage the risks and seize the opportunities of net zero, without full clarity on the policy path to get there.", "But we need to recognise that setting clear and comprehensive policy will take time, likely years.", "The recent Green Finance Strategy takes us forward in a significant way, but the extent of policy making is formidable.", "We should also not be in any doubt that the transition is already building, creating opportunities and crystallising risks, and that its speed will only accelerate.", "Within the UK, policies on energy efficiency in buildings are driving changes now.", "And transition policies elsewhere such as the US Inflation Reduction Act will have on-shored impacts for the UK.", "So firms cannot, and should not, delay taking action to better understand how transition might impact their businesses.", "As I mentioned earlier, the CBES revealed a significant gap in the understanding of real economy firms on what the transition to net zero means for them.", "Whilst I recognise there is uncertainty, I urge firms to explore how different scenarios are relevant to their strategy, to test their specific vulnerabilities and to identify opportunities.", "Here at the Bank, we have helped create tools to support such analysis.", "And they continue to be enhanced.", "They include carbon prices consistent with different pathways to net zero to help you identify robust strategies.", "I encourage you to use them.", "And the fourth challenge is that system wide change is complex as the actions of one are dependent on actions of others, so it is important to coordinate action throughout the supply chain.", "Each firm should be stretching its horizons - building capabilities now that enable action to drive long-term reductions in emissions through their value chain.", "That does not mean immediately ceasing to deal with high emission counterparties and suppliers.", "That does not necessarily remove emissions, perhaps chasing them into the shadows instead.", "Rather, economy-wide emissions reductions will come through proactive engagement with counterparties and suppliers, and decisions aligned to the transition over time.", "This means understanding the needs of firms up and down the supply chain and having difficult discussions about steps to reduce emissions.", "And smaller corporates will need help from larger corporates and their financiers to develop their climate expertise.", "The collaboration between GARP and Chapter Zero we see today shows how effective that can be in driving faster progress.", "I truly believe that transformation can come from constructive and systematic engagement with your value chain.", "I therefore urge you to convene your opposite numbers in and around the real economy.", "Chapter Zero is a great network.", "Who knows, the source of your Scope 3 emissions may be sat in this room!", "We know the costs of transition to a net-zero economy are lowest with early and wellmanaged action.", "And we are making good progress in supporting that transition, arguably more than we might have expected given the shocks we have faced.", "But there is still much more to do.", "We have not yet reached the tipping point where we have built the capabilities and the transition finance infrastructure that will support the right strategic decisions in an unavoidably uncertain transition.", "We all have a role to play in driving progress.", "Governments globally have the key role in developing the policy paths and infrastructure that deliver the transition and draw us closer to this tipping point.", "Central banks and regulators can operate within their objectives to catalyse, complement and amplify those policies.", "And, business and finance can -
