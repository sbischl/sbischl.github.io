in competition is defined as a reduction of excess rents in these markets by just a fifth - in other words, monopoly profits in the economy are reduced by 20%.", "This assumed reduction in rents is rather modest, and the model does not assume the increased competition to have any effects on the rate of technological change, so the total impact on output is not huge, at only about 3%.", "But more

large impact on Finland given the importance the sector had gained in the 1990s.", "This favourable asymmetric shock would have been expected to cause a real appreciation of the currency.", "Outside
