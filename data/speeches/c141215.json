together with the big banks and with the support of the SNB - has conducted a comparison of RWA calculated with the model-based approach and the standardised approach.", "The SNB suggests that banks consider the possibility of publishing the results of this analysis in appropriate form.", "In any case, the SNB remains convinced that banks which use the model-based approach for calculating their RWA must continue to improve their transparency with regard to their risks.", "Considerable progress has been made already, especially in terms of disclosing changes in RWA broken down by cause.", "Publishing a parallel calculation of RWA based on the standardised approach would greatly contribute to building trust and market discipline.", "Enhanced transparency is likely to be a key component of the measures that the Basel Committee will put in consultation.", "Domestically focused commercial banks I would now like to turn to the situation of the domestically focused banks.", "Risks facing these banks are still primarily connected with the mortgage and real estate markets.", "These risks have largely remained unchanged at a high level over the past six months.", "In the last half year, the momentum in the mortgage market slowed, with annual growth in mortgage lending slightly less high than in the previous quarters.", "The mortgage volume continued to rise more steeply than GDP, but the difference between the two growth rates has become smaller.", "Furthermore, real estate prices continued to rise but, as in 2013, momentum remained below the levels observed until 2012.", "Developments still varied widely from one region to the other.", "Whereas real estate prices in some regions hardly increased or even decreased, other regions continued to register significant price rises.", "However, it is still too early for an all-clear.", "First, the imbalances that have built up since the beginning of the low-interest-rate phase remain at a high level.", "Second, mortgage interest rates have again dropped to historically low levels in the past few months.", "And third, there are no broad-based indications of a change in the banks' risk appetite.", "Mortgage lending growth at the domestically focused banks has also decreased, but is still markedly higher than overall market growth.", "Moreover, the affordability risk (loan-to-income ratio) in mortgage lending has continued to rise, interest rate risk remains at a historically high level, and interest rate margins have fallen even further, from a level which was already low.", "In these exceptional circumstances, banks should ensure that their resilience is high enough to be able to bear the risks taken, even in the event of a marked real estate price correction combined with an interest rate shock.", "The countercyclical capital buffer plays a significant role in this context by ensuring that banks hold additional capital as a buffer in the current situation.", "Adding to that, many banks have a surplus of capital with respect to the regulatory requirements.", "Such surplus capital is especially important under the current circumstances.", "Banks should therefore maintain these surpluses in future, or should establish and increase them in line with their risk profile.", "As before, the SNB will regularly assess whether the countercyclical capital buffer needs to be adjusted due to mortgage and real estate market developments.", "If the momentum in these markets picks up again, additional measures to limit the affordability risk in mortgage lending should be taken into consideration."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Big banks", "Risk-weighted capital ratios", "Leverage ratios", "Model-based risk-weighted assets", "Domestically focused banks", "Mortgage market", "Real estate market", "Countercyclical capital buffer", "Affordability risk", "Interest rate risk"]}
