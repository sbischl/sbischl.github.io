growth of private investment.", "Towards this end, the Central Bank will continue to ensure that access to financing across all segments remains in place.", "While it is critical for the public sector

inflows.", "This could in turn fuel asset prices, thereby increasing the risk to financial stability which could undermine the process of economic recovery.", "Indeed, some countries in the Asian region are already facing these issues and have introduced measures to reduce the risks associated with capital inflows.", "For Malaysia, however, it should be noted that the financial industry, the private sector and the country have the capacity to manage these challenges, given the stronger overall financial conditions in the country, low levels of corporate leverage, a sound banking system and a strong external balance of payments position.", "Beyond the immediate priority of establishing economic recovery and preserving macroeconomic stability, it is also acknowledged that the Malaysian economy currently stands at a pivotal juncture.", "In order to secure continued medium and long-term growth and development, the structure of the economy has to undergo several important changes - changes that would better position Malaysia in meeting the new challenges and reaping the opportunities that the future Asian and global landscape brings.", "Foremost, the events of the past two years have brought to the forefront the importance of having a more balanced and diverse model of development.", "Malaysia's openness and integration with global trade and investment flows is an important source of our economic strength, and must remain so going forward.", "However, given the more dispersed growth prospects of the global economy in the future, it is important that the export structure of Malaysia evolves to be more diverse too.", "This will both increase our economic resilience and decrease our reliance on the traditional markets for our export growth.", "Encouragingly this trend of export market diversification has already started before the onset of the crisis.", "A decade ago, the share of Malaysia's exports to emerging and developing economies were below 50% of our total exports, but now, the figure has exceeded two-thirds.", "Going forward, it is important that this trend is reinforced.", "However, to achieve a more balanced growth, we need to not only leverage on our competitive advantage in the external sector, but also expand the strength of our domestic sector.", "Since 2003, domestic demand has been a main contributor to our economic growth, especially private consumption, in which growth has consistently outstripped that of the overall economy.", "Going forward however, a more sustainable balanced growth would require higher contribution from private investment.", "It is important to recognise that no country has ever managed to consume its way to prosperity.", "Both economic theory and the history of economic development point to the lesson that high-level of consumption does not guarantee higher rate of economic growth for a sustained period.", "Investment, on the other hand, is a prerequisite for a dynamic economy that is moving towards a higher level of income and development.", "Indeed, many new areas of growth in Malaysia would benefit from higher investment, such as in niche growth segments in the services sector, as well as in the development of enabling infrastructure such as in broadband and green technology.", "Investment in green technology has the potential to not only increase the efficiency of the economy, but also to open up new sources of growth.", "As Malaysia moves from a cost-competitive economy to one that is more knowledge and innovation-driven, it is not just the quantity of investment that matters, but the quality of investment that would dictate our ability to move up the value-chain.", "An important consideration in ensuring high quality investment is the availability of complementary factors.", "Here, I would like to highlight three of these factors, namely a private sector-led competitive environment, high quality workforce and the availability of enabling infrastructures.", "A business friendly environment with minimal market distortions is critical to ensure that the private sector can direct its investment activities efficiently and to areas of the greatest growth and return potentials.", "Similarly, the availability of skilled workforce and modern infrastructures such as high-speed broadband is key in ensuring that high value-added and high knowledge-content investments take place.", "Much is currently being discussed and debated on the issues of high quality workforce and information age enabling infrastructures, especially given the Government's renewed emphasis on them in the recent efforts to transform the Malaysian economy.", "Allow me to elaborate more on the key complementary factor that has been in my opinion receiving relatively less focus in current public debate, and, this is the need to develop an extensive market-driven private sector-led competitive environment.", "As an economy moves up the value-added chain, and develops knowledge intensive industries, the dynamics of interplay and balance between the private sector and the public sector changes significantly.", "In a developing economy, the role of the public sector is broader and it actively drives many economic decisions - from development of appropriate infrastructures and institutions to more direct allocation of resources.", "But as an economy becomes more developed, with progressively more complex, sophisticated and knowledgeintensive activity, it is increasingly untenable for the public sector to hold comparative advantage in allocating resources efficiently.", "It is thus crucial that the private sector takes on a more dominant role in driving economic growth and for price mechanism to be widely market driven in order for resources to be efficiently and productively allocated across all segments of the economy.", "For the private sector to develop and to drive economic growth, two crucial prerequisites are needed.", "First, the economy-wide market-based incentive structure must underpin economic motivations and clear market signals must be allowed to guide decisions of economic agents.", "This implies that productive investment, employment and entrepreneurial decisions are not to be hindered by direct or indirect market distortions.", "Second, competition is needed to drive economic efficiency and dynamism.", "A vibrant economy cannot exist without competition.", "In particular, with an ever globalised world, competition is no longer local - the private sector cannot just compete locally when the flows of goods, capital and talent are global.", "Furthermore, in a global stage, long-term relevance can only be sustained through genuine competition-driven competitiveness rather than through public sector support.", "To develop both an appropriate incentive structure and a market-driven environment, it is crucial that market and price distortions are removed and greater competition is introduced, such as through deregulation, liberalisation and greater transparency of rules and regulations.", "While the government moves towards this, the private sector must be ready to operate in this more open and competitive environment.", "An example of an industry within Malaysia in which a private sector-led competitive environment is being developed is the financial sector.", "Over the last several years, the domestic financial sector has been gradually liberalised and subjected to greater global competition, with the dual aims of enhancing the role of the financial sector as a source of growth and as a key enabler and catalyst of economic growth.", "Growth of the financial sector also strengthens Malaysia's economic interlinkages with other economies.", "Liberalisation is done after ensuring that the financial institutions are in a state of readiness to compete in a more competitive and challenging environment.", "Through the financial reforms and capacity building efforts undertaken over the years since the Asian financial crisis, domestic financial institutions are now well capitalised and resilient with strengthened corporate governance, efficient internal structures, robust risk management practices and diversified sources of income.", "Indeed, the domestic financial institutions have extended their presence regionally.", "The global financial and economic system over the past two years has gone through an equivalent of a cardiac arrest due to the excesses of the past.", "With swift, strong, coordinated and committed policy responses around the world, however, stability has been gradually restored and a repeat of the last depression averted.", "Now, a new world is emerging, one that is very different from the one before the crisis.", "In this new world, the prospects for Asia is encouraging, in both contributing to and assuming greater responsibility for supporting global stability and longer-term growth.", "For Malaysia, sustained growth and successful transformation of the economy towards a higher level of development would depend crucially on how we prepare ourselves in facing the coming challenges and seizing the emerging opportunities."],
