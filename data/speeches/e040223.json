with the exception of perceptible but relatively narrow spreads in longterm bonds.", "This means the Pact is a type of \"insurance\" against the age-old human temptation to be a \"free rider\" and to make others pay for one's own actions.", "Another equally important reason for the Pact is an economic reason.", "Balanced budgets, or at least low deficits and acceptable levels of debt, are an important for growth and prosperity.", "Excessive deficits are accompanied by high government shares in GDP - in Germany, the spending-to-GDP ratio in 2003 was 49% (up from 39% in 1970).", "What a high spending-to-GDP ratio and the resultant high tax and social security ratio do, however, is reduce general efficiency, promote the relocation of investment and jobs, cause adverse changes in the behaviour of economic agents (eg an increase in the \"shadow economy\") as well as strain important resources of society, resulting in moves to avoid taxes and levies as well as to obtain transfers and subsidies, a practice also termed \"rent-seeking\".", "Conversely, balanced budgets or at least low deficits and low levels of debt allow for lower taxes and facilitate private investment and also government investment.", "Low interest rates give the public sector more scope for investment to improve the public infrastructure.", "A comparison of growth rates in Europe confirms that countries with lower deficits have faster growth rates, whereas countries like Germany, which have repeatedly exceeded the Pact's 3% deficit limit (2002: 3.5%, 2003: 4%, also expected to be well over 3% in 2004), have to battle persistent stagnation and unemployment.", "The Pact is therefore also a sort of insurance against the typical risks to growth and prosperity in modern societies with a high spending-to-GDP ratio.", "It is insurance against the temptation to use lavish government benefits to buy votes in the present and pass the bill on to future generations which are not yet eligible to vote.", "\"Sustainability\" is not just an ecological principle; it is also a principle of fiscal responsibility.", "It is particularly important against the backdrop of the demographic strains and the attendant hidden government debt caused by an ageing society.", "We need to remember that \"economy\", in the sense of its Greek root word oikonomia\u0304, simply translates to \"management of a household or family\", ie rule-based behaviour.", "Thirdly, the obligation to keep government deficits below the 3% limit is by no means rigid.", "Weighing up all the pros and cons, it is an appropriate and sound course of action.", "- The Pact strives to achieve balanced budgets throughout the entire cycle.", "Budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus in good years allow automatic stabilisers (cyclically-related lower tax revenue, higher costs of unemployment) in economically bad years.", "- Practical experience (eg abeyance if a member state has promised to take measures which have not yet been implemented) has shown that the monitoring and infringement procedure is quite time-consuming.", "In practice, the process from \"early warning\" to \"recommendations\" to \"defining a deadline for adaptation\" to the imposition of an interest-free loan to a fine may last two to three years - giving governments sufficient time to take flexible adjustment measures.", "- Finally, what is often forgotten is that the 3%-limit was chosen for Maastricht against the background of an expected nominal growth rate of 5% and a real trend growth rate of 3% (3% nominal deficit in terms of 5% growth result in a trend debt level of 60%).", "Today we know that these assumptions regarding potential growth were very optimistic and that actual growth has been much lower.", "The 3%-limit is therefore relatively generous.", "The Ecofin council's decision on 25 November 2003 not to act further on the basis of European Stability and Growth Commission recommendations regarding France and Germany subjected the Pact crisis acid to a and an test.", "Prior to the decision, some said that if the procedure was not pursued properly in accordance with Article 104 (8) and (9) of the Treaty, the Pact was effectively \"dead\".", "The press was rife with black humour - \"obituaries\" of the Pact were published.", "I do not share this view.", "A look at everyday life shows us that violating a rule or norm does not automatically invalidate or \"kill\" it.", "However, we must do all that we can to implement the Pact, to reactivate it and thus to the weakened public in the \"Maastricht rules\".", "The evident confusion and obvious differences of opinions about the fundamental questions regarding the workings of the Stability Pact as defined by the Treaty and the Council Regulations are cause for concern.", "Does the Council of Finance Ministers have leeway for continuing the procedure if it shares the Commission's view that a member state has not sufficiently complied with its obligations?", "Can the Council adopt a new (Article 104 (7)) even if a member state did not sufficiently comply with earlier recommendations, causing and the therefor has submitted another proposal (cf Article 104 (13))?", "Finally, does the official declaration of the Heads of State or Government made in Amsterdam in July 1997, according to which the Council of Finance Ministers \"is invited always to impose sanctions if a participating Member State fails to take the necessary steps to bring the excessive deficit situation to an end as recommended by the Council\", have only political significance, or does this not also imply that they have committed themselves to comply with the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact?", "Article 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties expressly recognises the possibility of such \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\".", "It has therefore become such a fundamental question of that the Commission, in its role as the \"guardian of the EU treaties\", filed an objection to the Ecofin council's decision of 25 November with the European Court of Justice.", "It is also necessary to avoid \"contagion of other members\" other member states or acceding countries.", "Until the European Court of Justice has decided on the issue, I certainly believe it is to discuss to the Pact.", "There may indeed be some well-meaning and reasonable suggestions out there with the intent of improving the Pact's effectiveness, such as the idea of \"giving the Pact more muscle\" in the event that a member state fails to reduce structural deficits in good years and thereby robs itself of the discretionary scope to stay under the 3%-limit in not-so-good years.", "Despite all the proposals, it must be borne in mind that loosening the rules of the Pact might open up a Pandora's box, and a new legal framework could have potential damaging effects on growth and conflict avoidance in monetary union.", "The aim must always be to achieve effective, operable and transparent procedures.", "As the ancient Romans told us, \"Quidquid agis ... respice finem\"."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Stability and Growth Pact", "Fiscal Policy", "Monetary Union", "Economic Growth", "Government Deficit", "Debt Sustainability", "Compliance", "Rule-Based Behaviour", "Maastricht Approach", "European Court of Justice"]}
