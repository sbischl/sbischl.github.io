when in receipt of a low signal falling short of some critical level , and adopting strategy when in receipt of a high signal exceeding some critical level .", "The condition determining this threshold is (see Condition (1) allows us to perform comparative statics on the unique coordination equilibrium.", "Using (1) it follows that the threshold level of fundamentals above which banks set risky policies is (a) increasing in the long-term cost of extending bad credit , and (b) decreasing in relative reputational concerns , or Both results accord with intuition.", "First, increasing the cost to banks of pursuing risky strategies causes banks to coordinate on risky policies only at very high levels of fundamentals.", "Or, put differently, safety prevails over a larger range of fundamentals when risky policies are costly.", "Prudential policies (discussed further in Section 5) are one means of raising the cost to banks of pursuing such risky strategies.", "These prudential policies would have both direct effects and strategic effects in the model.", "A rise in long term costs raises the direct cost to bank of adopting a risky strategy.", "But it also leads bank to expect fewer other banks to adopt risky policies.", "So a rise in has both a direct effect on banks' actions an effect through banks' expectations of others' actions.", "This expectational channel is crucial from a policy perspective.", "Second, reputational concerns act in the opposite direction.", "As greater weight is placed on shortterm reputation, incentives are sharpened to signal high ability by pursuing risky policies, even when their signalling effect is relatively small (\uf071 is low).", "As in Rajan (1994), a tight credit policy becomes optimal for all levels of fundamentals as \uf067 \uf0ae \uf030, or as reputational concerns vanish.", "Conversely, if increased competition and deregulation increase reputational concerns, this increases the propensity of the system to periodic credit booms and subsequent busts.", ".3 Dynamics This model can generate credit cycles which amplify cycles in the real economy relative to a world without credit cycle frictions.", "Without frictions, bad loans are liquidated immediately, allowing new assets to be originated next period to unencumbered borrowers.", "By contrast, extending credit to bad risks eventually results in balance sheet impairment for both borrowers and lenders.", "We perform a simple simulation to illustrate these dynamics.", "Suppose the macro state moves stochastically around its trend as a result of a sequence of iid productivity shocks.", "The macro state is mean-reverting as long as banks set tight policies when they realise low asset returns.", "This occurs when reputational effects are switched off .", "Next suppose reputational concerns are introduced, leading banks to risk up to signal high ability.", "Because of strategic complementarities, banks do this whenever .", "This leads to subsequent impairment of the borrowing sector.", "These dynamics are captured in the simple specification where indexes time, are iid normal shocks and is the indicator function taking value 1 when and value otherwise.", "As reputational concerns disappear, the term goes to zero, leaving simple autoregressive dynamics.", "But with reputational externalities, productivity shocks become amplified by the credit cycle: a high realisation of in period could push the macro state above the risky policy threshold, at which point the dynamics of begin also to shape the real economy.", "The distribution of is assumed to have a higher mean and variance than to simulate the effects of the credit boom.", "In particular, we constrain the distribution of relative to such that expected risk-adjusted fundamentals are constant over time.", "So we have, in effect, a regime-switching model.", "When banks play safe strategies, fundamentals are relatively stable.", "When banks risk up, they create a temporary improvement in expected fundamentals at the cost of greater volatility.", "This dynamic specification has some interesting properties.", "First, even small shocks can have disproportionately large effects on fundamentals depending on the initial conditions.", "In particular, if fundamentals happen to be close to the switching threshold, a further positive shock will lead all firms to coordinate on the high risk-taking strategy.", "That drives up both the expected value of fundamentals and its volatility.", "This generates a form of path dependence.", "Second, credit cycles are endogenous in this framework.", "As firms coordinate on high risk strategies, this drives up the expected value of fundamentals.", "But it also drives up volatility due to risk illusion.", "Because riskadjusted returns are constant, this must entail an increase in the probability of there being a severe negative shock, so the probability of a crash rises.", "Chart 2 shows a simulation of the model when for 100 periods with normally distributed shocks.", "The frictionless benchmark model generates the path shown by the maroon line.", "As specified, the path is mean reverting, with movements in the macro state around trend.", "Allowing for reputational effects generates the blue path, giving a threshold level of fundamentals shown by the green dashed line.", "As the macro state hits the threshold, banks adopt risky policies to signal high ability.", "In this simulation this happens four times, in periods 3, 50, 68 and 72.", "Consider the threshold breach in period 72.", "As during the Great Moderation, the good macro state at first persists.", "The credit boom fuels high fundamentals.", "But while headline fundamentals have improved, risk-adjusted fundamentals have not.", "Eventually, this results in a crunch in credit and a sharp deterioration in the macro state, as risk is realised.", "Now suppose that financial liberalisation generates heightened competition between banks, increasing the market premium on reputation.", "This raises the value of in the model.", "Chart 3 shows the effects of the reputational weight being raised .",

simulation with low reputational weight Source: Bank calculations.", "Model simulation with high reputational weight 2.4 Empirical implications Several empirical implications follow from the model.", "First, strategic complementarities incentivise banks to adopt risky strategies in a coordinated fashion during the boom.", "So the dynamics of the model predict that we should observe cycles in financial activity at a macroeconomic level.", "Initial productivity improvements are amplified into lending booms, which are followed by credit busts and, potentially, crises.", "Second, at a micro-economic level, the coordination of risky strategies during the boom should compress the dispersion of bank earnings, as low ability banks masquerade as high ability banks during good times.", "But during the bust, when the macro state turns bad, the dispersion of banks' earnings should increase as low ability types crystallise losses while high ability types do not.", "We turn next to the macro and micro evidence.", "Credit cycle dynamics To what extent are the macroeconomic credit cycle dynamics predicted by the model present in the real world?", "To assess that, we draw on a dataset recently developed by Schularick and Taylor (2009).", "This covers a lengthy time-series (often more than a century of data) across 12 developed countries.", "It enables us to identify lower (than

changed either side of the wars (Table 1).", "But real credit has grown around twice as quickly since 1945.", "In consequence, loan/GDP ratios trend upwards from around 1945, consistent with financial liberalisation and deepening (Charts 4 and 5).", "The same general pattern is evident in the volatilities of output and credit.", "The variability of real GDP growth has, if anything, fallen in the period since 1945.", "The standard deviation of real credit growth rose in the years immediately following 1945 and has remained above those levels, especially since 1980.", "Since 1945, the standard deviation of real credit growth has been around five times that of real activity.", "On the face of it, these summary statistics are consistent with credit dynamics being distinct from GDP dynamics.",

of a series operating in a frequency range specified by the user.", "Charts 6-7 show cyclical fluctuations in real loan growth in the UK and US.", "The specified frequency domain is 8-20 years.",

Credit cycle spillovers This empirical evidence to date, operating at a macro-economic level, is consistent with the model in Section 2: a credit cycle is clearly discernible; its frequency is different and its amplitude larger than the business cycle; and its fluctuations may exacerbate the business cycle.", "But the model also has implications at a micro-economic level, arising from strategic complementarities, or spillover effects, across firms.", "In this section we consider empirical evidence on such credit spillover effects.", "The model implies that the cross-sectional distribution of returns to banking should be compressed during a credit boom, as banks seek to keep up with competitors by collectively boosting returns.", "This is a time-series phenomenon.", "A second implication is that the dispersion in returns may be smaller for financial than for non-financial companies to the extent that former are more susceptible to risk illusion.", "This is a cross-sectional phenomenon.", "To assess these hypotheses, Charts 12 and 13 look at the dispersion of returns for publicly listed US banks calculated in two ways: implied market returns on bank equity and reported returns on banks' equity (ROE).", "For comparison, the dispersion of returns among the largest US non-financial companies is also shown, together with identified periods of credit boom.",

level.", "Given the much higher levels of leverage among banks than non-banks, that is surprising: high leverage should bias against finding lower dispersion in banking.", "It is consistent with stronger herding incentives in banking.", "Second, measures of return dispersion tend to fall during periods of credit boom, statistically significantly so at the 1% level.", "For example, measures of equity return dispersion hit all-time lows at the height of the recent credit boom in 2006-2007.19 Counter-cyclical variation in equity return dispersion is well documented in the finance literature.", "For example, Schwert (1989) finds no single macroeconomic variable that can explain low frequency movements in equity price volatility.", "Further evidence is provided in Hamilton and

banks.", "At least in principle, these externalities suggest a role for the state in enforcing collective lending action, to curb the peaks and troughs in the credit cycle.", "The case for policy action may have grown over recent decades as competition in banking, and associated externalities, have intensified.", "Second, it has been suggested that one means of curbing credit cycle frictions is through monetary policy - either by ensuring it moderates appropriately the business cycle (Taylor (2010)) or, more ambitiously, by having it play a wider role in curtailing financial imbalances (Borio and White (2004)).", "The evidence presented here is not especially encouraging on that front.", "The frequency and amplitude of the business and credit cycles is quite different.", "Monetary policy may be an inefficient tool for calming the credit cycle, if at the same time it is to moderate the business cycle.", "Recent history offers a good case study.", "Between 2000 and 2007, UK nominal GDP growth exhibited no signs of exuberance, with GDP growth at trend and inflation at target.", "Over the same period, UK banks' balance sheets trebled.", "Using monetary policy to tame credit growth over this period would have come at the expense of a destabilisation of non-financial activity.", "Activist monetary policy would have resulted in instability migrating from the financial to the non-financial sector.", "In tackling the credit cycle, monetary policy may have, in Irving Fisher's language, \"aggravated rather than neutralised\" the business cycle.", "Econometric evidence tends to support this view.", "Model-based simulations by the IMF suggest the need for two instruments to tackle efficiently real as well as financial imbalances (IMF (2009)).", "And the empirical evidence in Bean et al (2010) suggests that monetary policy may be a rather ineffective instrument quantitatively in constraining credit growth.", "This suggests that assigning monetary policy the task of tackling financial imbalances may be inefficient, perhaps ineffective.", "Charts 18 and 19 plot credit cycles in the UK and US from 1880, together with the different monetary policy regimes which have operated over this period.", "Strikingly, credit cycles dynamics appear to be largely invariant to the monetary policy regime - fixed or floating, rules or discretion, lax or tight.", "This, too, is indicative evidence that monetary policy may not be the most effective tool for moderating credit fluctuations.", "Third, micro-prudential policy aimed at tackling financial imbalances in individual financial institutions may also be ineffective for dealing with aggregate credit cycles.", "That is because bankspecific actions will not, by themselves, internalise the spillovers that arise across banks over the credit cycle.", "At best, this means that micro-prudential actions may be impotent in curbing the credit cycle.", "At worst, however, it could mean that bank-specific prudential actions are counterproductive.", "They might actually boost risk-taking incentives among banks which are not subject to prudential intervention.", "UK credit cycle across

by the payoffs in Table 4, in which now references the market's prior over the macro state, which it updates having observed a bank's earnings.", "When is neither too big nor too small, there are two symmetric Nash equilibrium strategies in this game: {Risky, Risky} and {Tight, Tight}.", "When Bank 1 sets {Risky}, Bank 2 does not want to set {Tight} and declare negative earnings as this is more likely to signal low ability, provided the long term costs are not too big.", "On the other hand, if Bank 1 sets {Tight}, Bank 2 sets tight too if long term costs are not too small.", "This results in a classic coordination game with multiple equilibria.", "Payoffs in a two-bank game Risky Tight Bank Tight Now suppose the regulator forces Bank 2 to set tight policies whenever it realises low returns.", "So if Bank 2 announces positive earnings, it must be because the macro state is good.", "But given this, Bank 1 does not want to signal low ability by playing {Tight} when it makes a bad loan since doing so would be taken by the market to imply low ability.", "If the spillover from Bank 2's actions to the market's assessment of the macro state is strong enough, {Tight, Tight} may no longer be an equilibrium.", "Instead, Bank 1 may play Risky.", "The resulting equilibrium is {Risky, Tight}.", "In this way, bank-specific intervention may have perverse consequences for risk-taking.", "Fourth, this co-ordination problem suggests systematic, across-the-system actions are needed to curtail effectively credit booms and busts.", "This is one dimension of macroprudential policy.", "To be effective, these policies need to increase the long-term cost of credit extension to banks during booms and, as importantly, to lower these costs during busts.", "These actions would help smooth out credit supply over the cycle.", "There are a variety of macro-prudential tools which could have this effect, including pro-cyclical capital and liquidity requirements, or remuneration packages that tie individual earnings more closely to long term performance (Bank of England (2009), Kashyap et al (2010), G30 (2010)).", "Chart 20 illustrates the impact of increasing the long term cost of short term risky strategies, , across the entire system in our simple model.", "The \"low \" and frictionless paths are identical to Chart 2.", "But if the regulator raises the cost of risky policies, the signalling threshold rises to the green dashed line.", "In this example, the increase in this threshold is sufficient to prevent risky policies arising at any point over the horizon.", "In other words, the \"high \" (macro-prudential) path replicates the frictionless equilibrium.", "The large output swings caused by risky lending cycles are reduced significantly.", "The financial accelerator is defused.", "Model simulation high long term cost of short term risky strategies Source: Bank calculations.", "Fifth, because credit cycles emerge from a failure to co-ordinate lending decisions, expectations are crucial for the effectiveness of macro-prudential policies.", "Perhaps even more than in a monetary policy context, macro-prudential policy works by acting on agents' expectations.", "For example, raising has a direct effect on lenders' behaviour, increased incentives to reduce risk.", "But as importantly, it also has an indirect expectational effect, as all lenders anticipate they will become subject to the same simultaneous squeeze.", "Anticipating that, lenders will co-ordinate their lending choices today provided policy is credible.", "These collective action dynamics underscore the importance of the expectations channel for macroprudential policy.", "This has important implications for the design of a macro-prudential framework.", "Without absolute clarity about the objectives of any macro-prudential policy framework and the policy rule necessary to deliver these objectives, expectations will not adjust and policy will be impotent.", "Any lack of transparency or failure of communications is likely to inhibit seriously the effectiveness of macro-prudential policy.", "Sixth, because macro-prudential policy is new in most developed countries, there are understandable concerns that policymakers' knowledge of the transmission mechanism of policy is incomplete and imperfect.", "The model of the credit cycle developed here offers some grounds for optimism.", "Signalling is the key transmission channel.", "Quantitative estimates of the effects of, for example, higher capital ratios on banks' cost of credit provision have wide confidence intervals (BIS (2010)).", "But this may not be fatal if macro-prudential policy by-passes these channels and works by acting, first and foremost, through expectations.", "Seventh, the credit cycle is increasingly an international phenomenon, as well as a national one.", "Credit spillovers occur across borders as well as across banks.", "This suggests macroprudential policies need also to have an international dimension if they are to tackle credit externalities.", "This is recognised in the macro-prudential policy framework currently being discussed by the international regulatory community (BIS (2010)).", "This framework includes an explicit reciprocity provision.", "For example, judgements on local credit conditions determine the amounts of capital to be held by international banks on their exposures in those countries.", "This reciprocity feature should help to reduce the arbitrage risks posed by the internationalisation of the credit cycle.", "Eighth, a second potential source of regulatory arbitrage is the shadow banking system.", "Even ahead of the present crisis, this had grown to a scale potentially in excess of the conventional banking system (Adrian et al (2010)).", "Operating macro-prudential policy on a sub-set of credit providers, ignoring the shadow banks, suffers the same problems as microprudential policy operating on a sub-set of banks.", "It risks not only being ineffective, but also providing incentives for risk to migrate to the unregulated sector.", "This underlines the importance of policing the regulatory boundary and moving this boundary if credit provision risks crossing the border in the course of setting macroprudential policy.", "Ninth, especially at the outset, uncertainties about the role and efficacy of macro-prudential policy will be considerable.", "Simplicity and humility will be needed.", "Simplicity to prevent confusion about the objectives and transmission channels for macro-prudential policy, given the importance of signalling.", "Humility to reduce the chances of banks over-relying on public policy signals about credit provision at a time when these are sure to be noisy (see Morris and Shin (2002)).", "As with the business cycle and monetary policy, macro-prudential policy cannot be expected to eliminate the credit cycle.", "This is neither feasible nor desirable.", "And simple rules, augmented by judgement, offer the best chance of ensuring robust decisionmaking at the start of a new macro-prudential policy regime (Taylor and Williams (2010)).", "Tenth, the state of macro-prudential policy today has many similarities with the state of monetary policy just after the second world war.", "Data is incomplete, theory patchy, policy experience negligible.", "Monetary policy then was conducted by trial and error.", "The same will be true of macroprudential policy now.", "Mistakes will be made.", "But as experience with the other arms of macroeconomic policy has taught us, the biggest mistake would be not to try.", "Model proofs Here we motivate the conditions that .", "Suppose Reputational probabilities: the market has prior that a banker's ability is
