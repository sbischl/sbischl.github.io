Fintech is a portmanteau word meaning any application of digital technologies to finance.", "Under this label we can include both giants of the digital world wanting to enter the financial market and tiny start-ups whose ambition is to erode the market power of the incumbents.", "All this is beneficial to competition and productivity in the financial industry, provided that the new entrants are properly supervised.", "Technology can help to innovate financial products and services currently provided by the traditional industry to the benefit of consumers.", "However, given all the well-known interconnections between operators in the market, the repercussions of technological innovation on the system's stability are not clear.", "Public institutions like central banks and other financial supervisory authorities should examine the matter carefully.", "The Bank of Italy has created an internal multidisciplinary team on Big Data, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.", "The team includes economists, statisticians and computer scientists from different departments, working in close cooperation with the Information Technology Department.", "IVASS, the insurance supervisory authority working under the umbrella of the Bank of Italy, has opened a regulatory sandbox for some aspects of Fintech/Insurtech.", "To conclude, I am confident this conference will be an important occasion to review the most recent findings on Big Data econometrics and its application to national institutions, in particular central banks, and international organizations.", "Bringing together researchers from central banks and academia, as we do on this occasion, can provide a broad variety of contributions and perspectives.", "I am sure we will have two productive and interesting days.", "Designed by the Printing and Publishing Division of the Bank of Italy"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Big Data", "Econometrics", "Financial stability", "Data security", "Fintech", "Machine learning", "Artificial intelligence", "Consumer sentiment", "Economic forecasts", "Data analytics"]}
