OFSO's tenth anniversary celebration comes at a time when the global financial crisis highlighted the significant risks that weak financial consumer protection poses to stability of the world's financial system.", "The consumer as depositor, policyholder, saver and borrower is the central actor in the financial marketplace.", "Worldwide, some 150 million new consumers join the financial market each year.", "Yet, ironically, the consumer's voice is often the weakest and, very often, is not heard.", "For this reason, the international community has increased its focus on how to better protect financial consumers.", "The G20 has adopted nine High-level Principles for Financial Consumer Protection.", "Of immediate relevance to the Ombudsman's Office is Principle 9, which speaks to consumers having access to adequate complaints handling and redress mechanisms that are accessible, affordable, independent, fair, accountable, timely and efficient.", "The World Bank has also released its Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection.", "The Good Practices are intended to be used primarily as a diagnostic tool to answer the question, \"How does a country's legal and regulatory framework for financial consumer protection compare to international practice?\"", "Our own recent financial turmoil arising from the failure of CLICO, CLICO Investment Bank and the Hindu Credit Union suggests that financial consumer protection, financial literacy and financial education are key priorities for regulators.", "As many of you are aware, tin is the traditional gift of the tenth anniversary.", "Many explanations abound as to why tin was chosen as the gift for the tenth anniversary.", "One explanation is that the flexibility of tin represents the flexibility of a good relationship, the give and take that makes a relationship strong.", "Another explanation relates to the use of tin to stop corrosion and thus keep food safe.", "In this meaning, tin symbolizes preservation and longevity.", "Whatever the meaning, it is clear that the Ombudsman's Office has demonstrated the good qualities associated with tin and can claim many successes over its ten years of operation.", "Some of these achievements are as follows: \u2022 The OFSO remains the only financial ombudsman scheme in the Caribbean and is a respected member of the International Network of

independence, fairness, clarity of scope and powers, effectiveness and efficiency, and accessibility, transparency and accountability.", "Please allow me to elaborate on what I consider to be some of the critical design issues, going forward.", "Perhaps the first and most critical design issue relates to changing the voluntary nature of the Financial Services Ombudsman regime to one under-pinned by legislative authority.", "The voluntary nature of the Ombudsman scheme has restricted the jurisdiction of the Office to a narrow list of complaints to which banks and insurance companies have agreed.", "In thinking about the statutory backing for the Ombudsman's Office, it may be necessary to have a flexible legal framework where the foundations are enshrined in law, but scope and operational arrangements are set in regulations.", "Independent governance is a second, critical design issue.", "Ideally, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman should be independent of consumers and of the financial services industry, whose disputes are being handled.", "In deciding cases, the Ombudsman also needs to be independent of the Central Bank, because the Ombudsman is

the financial industry and consumer protection.", "A third design issue revolves around the coverage of financial businesses.", "A significant number of complaints received by the Ombudsman are outside its Terms of Reference.", "The Office received 409 banking complaints which were outside its Terms of Reference in 2003-2012, 179 more than the qualified banking complaints it received for review.", "In 2011-2012, the Office received 1,173 enquiries regarding complaints outside the banking and insurance sectors.", "Many complaints which fall outside the Ombudsman's Terms of Reference relate to bank fees and pricing of bank products and services, lapsed insurance policies, insurance premium charged, personal injury for motor vehicle accidents, credit union shares and loans, and general pain and suffering.", "Expanding the Ombudsman's mandate to include credit unions, the Unit Trust Corporation, pension schemes and mutual funds would go a long way in strengthening the credibility of the scheme.", "Finally, in order to deliver on this expanded mandate the OFSO would need to be better resourced with the skill sets and talent as its jurisdiction and workload grows.",
