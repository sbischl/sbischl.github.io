level; dress rehearsals; working groups; a senior sponsors forum; and external assurance for the most significant firms.", "Responsibility lies with the DPs to manage and communicate with their thirdparty technology providers to ensure enhancement and testing of their systems, processes and client facing materials.", "DPs are also responsible for communicating and explaining these changes to their customers and suppliers: be those other financial institutions that indirectly participate in CHAPS, corporate customers, retail customers and other third-parties.", "Ongoing dialogue between the DPs and their stakeholders is essential to enable the whole industry to be ready and to benefit from the changes.", "It is therefore crucial that there are open channels of communication between DPs (as CHAPS settlement banks) and the financial institutions, corporates and individuals to whom they provide payment services.", "We strongly encourage a close dialogue so that these customers understand how their CHAPS settlement bank is approaching the transitions; how the changes will impact the way they send and receive payments; and how they can provide the richer data which ISO 20022 messages can carry.", "They will benefit from these changes by using the richer data to develop new products and services and by streamlining processes, making their businesses smarter and more efficient.", "The move to the renewed RTGS is a crucial transition requiring considerable change, but there is a big prize: to enhance the payments industry for everyone, including customers.",

trade and global development.", "For these reasons, the G20 has made enhancing cross-border payments a priority.", "In October 2020 the Financial Stability Board (FSB), in close collaboration with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), published a roadmap to enhance cross-border payments.", "The roadmap is made up of 19 building blocks, grouped into five focus areas ranging from enhancing the existing payment infrastructures, to advancing consistent international rules and standards, to more exploratory steps such as multilateral platforms and CBDC (see Annex 1Opens in a new window).", "of the 19 building blocks are owned or co-owned by the CPMI, and I am the Deputy Chair of the Programme Co-ordination Board that oversees this work.", "A number of actions have already been completed to enable the targets, currently being consulted on by the FSB, to be met.", "The importance of progress in this area was highlighted in the recent G7 Communique.", "The improvements we are making to RTGS, will help us to deliver key elements of the FSB roadmap.", "Key elements include the implementation of APIs, the capability to extend operating hours, synchronisation and our first key milestone of the implementation of the emerging global standard for financial messaging in payments ISO 20022.", "Future proofing the payments infrastructure Innovation is crucial to the future payments landscape.", "It is not a single act: it needs to be continuous.", "We are building a renewed RTGS service as a modular flexible platform so we can introduce new features in an agile flexible way with less cost and less risk, to enable us to respond more quickly to market changes and continued innovation in payment technologies.", "We already plan further enhancements following the replacement of the new our core ledger in September 2023.", "This will include the ability to connect via multiple message networks, additional APIs, consideration of extended operating hours and synchronisation functionality.", "It will also include improved contingency functionality to enhance resilience.", "These ideas have been developed in conjunction with industry, and we will be consulting later this year to help to prioritise the enhancements.", "I encourage you to actively participate in this consultation and to help shape the next phase.", "We are at a critical and
