conceive today that this could change.", "There is therefore hardly a pressing need to remove it.", "It could still be argued that in international comparisons Norges Bank is less independent than it actually is.", "On the other hand, it can be argued that Norway could be faced with a perilous situation, such as military conflict, for example, where the central bank itself finds that the government should use its power of instruction with regard to foreign exchange reserves and the central bank's management of monetary and liquidity policy.", "In many ways the current Norges Bank Act is a product of 1960s and 1970s economic thinking, but certain adjustments have been made to the Act since 1985.", "Particularly important is the prohibition against the central bank granting credit to the central government.", "The practice for appointing members of the Executive Board has also changed.", "Where the political parties in the Storting once nominated relevant candidates, members are now evaluated independently of party background and appointed by the Council of State upon the recommendation of the Ministry of Finance.", "One typical feature of recent central bank legislation in other countries is an objects provision that stipulates the central bank's primary objective as ensuring stability in monetary value.", "In Norway, this is set out in a statutory regulation and as an operational and more intermediate target.", "This is an essential difference.", "Another feature of central bank legislation in other countries is legal independence, in the sense that the central bank's use of instruments, primarily the key interest rate, cannot be overruled, whether by instruction or reversal.", "If the Norges Bank Act were being written today, it would probably include an objects section.", "As mentioned, much of the preparatory works is out of date so that the provisions of the Act of 1985 must be interpreted in the light of the current economic system.", "Moreover, Section 1 reads \"[t]he bank may implement any measures customarily or ordinarily taken by a central bank\", and this is something that changes, as we know.", "The Act is thus flexible enough to provide a suitable framework also for the conduct of monetary policy today.", "It specifies, moreover, that Norges Banks sets the interest rates on its loans and deposits.", "Norges Bank's responsibilities are also now well established through practice.", "The central bank is accountable Norges Bank has two parallel governing bodies.", "In addition to an Executive Board, appointed by the Council of State, it has a Supervisory Council appointed by the Storting.", "This is also shows the peculiar position of the Bank in the government administration.", "The direct link to the country's national assembly reflects that the Storting under Article 75 (c) of the Norwegian Constitution \"shall supervise the monetary affairs of the Realm\".", "The Supervisory Council continues to have a mix of administrative and supervisory duties, but its tasks were delimited by the Act of 1985.40 The Supervisory Council shall supervise the Bank's activities and ensure that the rules governing the Bank's operations are observed.", "The council has its own secretariat, adopts the annual accounts of Norges Bank and approves its budget.", "The Bank continues in part to be the Storting's bank.", "A substantial change has taken place over the past decade in that the Supervisory Council shall no long submit a report on its activities to the Ministry of Finance, but directly to the Storting.", "This is a partial reversal of the change to the Act that was made in 1949.", "In my judgement, the tasks of the Supervisory Council could be broadened.", "Among other things, it should be able to play a greater role in appointments to the Executive Board and Bank management, for example, through a formal right to make recommendations.", "This could give the Supervisory Council an even greater sense of ownership over the organisation and strengthen their sense of commitment.", "In central banking circles it is easy to confuse independence, expertise and long-termism with infallibility.", "Central bank independence in the use of instruments is contingent on central bank transparency and disclosure of the background for its decisions.", "This provides a basis for evaluating the Bank's decisions.", "Moreover, the central bank is accountable.", "In Norway, the Ministry of Finance performs an annual evaluation of the conduct of monetary policy in a separate report.", "Its assessment is partly based on a report by an independent expert group.", "The Governor of Norges Bank appears at a parliamentary hearing when the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs works on the report.", "The discussion concludes with a debate in the Storting.", "With new and clearly defined economic policy tasks, Norges Bank stepped back somewhat as economic policy advisor.", "For example, the Bank has discontinued its annual assessment of fiscal policy in what was at the time labelled \"budget letters\", and we rarely express our views on official reports regarding economic issues.", "Norges Bank is a consultative body for laws and regulations affecting the stability of the financial system.", "Moreover, the Bank is obliged under the Act to inform the Ministry when in the opinion of the Bank, there is a need for measures related to monetary, credit or exchange rate policy to be taken by others than the Bank.", "Financial stability A challenge for the central bank is that there is a gap between the instruments at the Bank's disposal in the area of financial stability and the existing expectations that the Bank can ensure the stability of the financial system.", "If liquidity dries up among banks in Norway or abroad, they are certain to turn to the central bank.", "The central bank acts as lender of last resort, as it can always supply liquidity in Norwegian kroner.", "Moreover, the central bank holds foreign exchange reserves that can be made available to the banks in critical situations.", "But we have no formal competence with regard to financial market regulation and prevention.", "What we can do is offer advice concerning regulation and set terms for banks' loans from the central bank.", "In 1986, Norges Bank provided substantial loans to the banks - at the highest around NOK 80 billion - to prevent a rise in money market rates after large-scale NOK purchases had been made in support of the krone.", "The loans, which were unsecured, were kept on Norges Bank's balance sheet when solvency problems at the banks began in 1987.", "Norges Bank was later criticised for providing these loans.", "Although the criticism was misdirected, the loans did make it more difficult for the government to manage the banking crisis.", "Today the Bank no longer provides unsecured loans and we have gradually tightened collateral requirements.", "Many banks rely heavily on short-term funding in international and domestic money markets.", "The lesson from the most recent financial crisis is that a shortfall in foreign funding can weaken stability in the financial system in Norway, even if the banks' financial position is not in jeopardy at the outset.", "The next step will therefore be not only to require collateral, but also impose requirements on our clients - the banks - to improve their funding strategies.", "Banks must not be given the scope to take on substantial liquidity risk in the belief or with the certainty that Norges Bank will intervene should foreign funding seize up.", "A market functions poorly in the long term with such hidden support.", "With large unsecured loans, Norges Bank ended up providing income support in one instance in the 1980s when a savings bank experienced solvency problems.", "The support included a soft loan and the write-down of a loan.", "The measures were part of a broader bank rescue package.", "The Ministry of Finance immediately submitted a report to the Storting write-down of loans (Report No.", "24 (1989-90) where the Ministry of Finance wrote\"..The from the central bank may [...] represent an active use of central government funds that should be deliberated in the Storting in advance\".", "The Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs endorsed this view and the resolution received final approval only after the Storting had deliberated the matter.", "This delimitation of Norges Bank's tasks is important.", "Norges Bank shall not provide grants or capital to the banks.", "During the financial crisis in August 2008, the banks' short-term and medium-term funding seized up.", "Norges Bank provided short-term loans as is customary and natural for a central bank.", "At the same time, we took the initiative to put in place the swap arrangement, whereby banks could exchange covered bonds (OMFs) for government securities.", "This went through the government's balance sheet and not that of the central bank.", "The central bank did not provide long-term loans on a large scale.", "This distinguishes the management of the financial crisis in Norway from a number of other countries in that we are of the view that it is appropriate for such medium-term financing - as in the case of solvency support - to be provided by the government and not Norges Bank, if the situation has reached a point where this is necessary.", "The measure is given a broad democratic grounding through government and Storting deliberations.", "This approach also serves to counter the kind of criticism that was levelled at Norges Bank when it provided funding for banks in the mid-1980s.", "Financial imbalances ordinarily build up over a long period before they trigger a crisis.", "Internationally, measures intended to prevent systemic risks in the financial sector are usually referred to as macroprudential policy.", "The government authorities should primarily use structural measures to dampen selfintensifying forces behind credit growth and rising property prices.", "The most important measure will be to increase banks' capital requirements.", "The international minimum standard for banking regulation will be strengthened under the forthcoming Basel III framework.", "However, we note that some countries do not wish to subject their banks to stringent standards.", "These countries' governments are more concerned that their banks have framework conditions at least as favourable as competitors from other countries.", "This attitude leads to a competition to weaken the requirements as far as possible.", "The minimum requirements will not be lower than the level all the major countries will agree to.", "Given such minimum requirements, there is every reason to set stricter national rules.", "The Norwegian authorities have been doing this for a number of years, including requiring banks to hold more pure equity than most other countries have done.", "Banks object that higher capital standards make it more expensive to operate and will make borrowing more expensive for households and enterprises, in addition to reducing the competitiveness of Norwegian banks.", "But that a bank should be at a competitive disadvantage if it is not allowed to be as financially weak as another bank is hard to take seriously.", "This line of thinking presupposes that the government will bail out the banks.", "But we should not accept this supposition.", "Higher capital ratios will make banks less risky for shareholders, creditors and the government.", "Less risk means that banks' creditors will require a lower interest rate.", "In addition to higher permanent capital standards and other structural measures, it is also appropriate to use discretionary measures when systemic risk increases above normal.", "Under Basel III, higher capital requirements for banks can be required in the event of rising lending growth and surging property prices, see Chart 4.", "But other measures are also possible.", "Finanstilsynet (the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway), for example, sets limits on the size of a single loan in relation to the collateral provided.", "Another possible measure is to set minimum requirements for the risk weights banks can use in their internal model-based approach to calculating capital adequacy.", "In other countries the procedures are now being revised to allow central banks to participate when such discretionary measures are implemented.", "In Norway, Finanstilsynet is highly competent in the oversight of individual institutions.", "However, Norges Bank has more competence in macroeconomic matters, given its tasks.", "The central bank also has an informational advantage as we are the bankers' bank and operate in foreign and domestic markets.", "The division of responsibility should be based on the advantages specific to each organisation.", "The Ministry of Finance should define the objective of macroprudential supervision and delegate its use.", "The Ministry must also assess whether the objective has been achieved.", "One alternative is to delegate responsibility for implementing discretionary measures against systemic risk to Norges Bank.", "Another is procedural requirements for using Norges Bank's expertise appropriately.", "The Bank may, for example, have the right and a duty to issue an opinion.", "Finanstilsynet should in principle have to follow the advice provided by the Bank.", "If the advice is not followed, an explanation must be provided and made publicly available.", "In order to ensure a disciplined decision-making process, the relationship to the other components of economic policy must be clear.", "Macroprudential supervision must seek to reduce systemic risk and take monetary policy and fiscal policy as a given.", "The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation and to contribute to dampening fluctuations in output and employment.", "Monetary policy takes into account that pronounced movements in credit growth and house prices can feed through to inflation and output, but is not geared directly to stabilising the financial system.", "Norges Bank is no longer in search of a role.", "We no longer take part in corporatist processes.", "Norges Bank now has a less prominent role as advisor.", "We do not believe in economic fine-tuning, but we do have instruments that can ensure low and stable inflation over time.", "Macroprudential supervision is now being moulded.", "Norges Bank must critically evaluate the funding structures of banks that have access to our lending facilities.", "We must develop instruments that can induce banks to limit their short-term borrowing in domestic and foreign markets.", "There is a strong sense at Norges Bank that we are being put to effective use today.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications":
