meaning that the very existence of the euro is being questioned.", "Recent actions, particularly by the European Central Bank (ECB), are now directly addressing this risk.", "The ECB has recently introduced a new program - the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program - that is specifically designed to eliminate the risk of euro redenomination.", "Simply put, subject to certain conditions, the ECB will act to ensure that yields on any particular euro-area country's short-term government bonds should reflect only the credit risk of that sovereign, not the risk that the country will leave the euro.", "By lowering yields in this manner, the ECB will substantially improve the transmission of monetary policy, and thereby increase the prospects for economic recovery in Europe.", "Second, it would be helpful if European authorities would reframe the expectations of citizens and market participants regarding the time horizon over which European monetary union will be refounded.", "You are no doubt aware that there has been a seemingly endless series of crisis summits held about the euro in recent years -

the so-called \"fiscal cliff.\"", "If authorities do not change these provisions, this massive fiscal drag will likely push the U.S. economy back into recession next year.", "That is not what we expect, but like others, we cannot be sure.", "There is evidence that uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the fiscal cliff issue is already having an adverse impact.", "While the general tone of the U.S. data has improved slightly of late and financial markets have held up, high-frequency indicators related to U.S. business investment - where one would expect to see the greatest impact of uncertainty - have weakened.", "For example, new orders for capital goods have fallen sharply, declining by 26 per cent over the most recent three months.", "This is by far the weakest result since the end of the recession.", "The Bank assumes that the United States will, in the end, step back from the fiscal cliff.", "Even with that assumption in place, the Bank projected in its July Monetary Policy Report that fiscal tightening in the United States will remove 1 percentage point from U.S. growth in 2012, and 1.5 percentage points in each of 2013 and 2014.", "Under such a scenario, the near-term hit to the economy is largely avoided, but the need for fiscal consolidation persists - as indeed it does under any plausible scenario.", "A clear, consistent and committed medium-term U.S. fiscal plan, one that demonstrates how this consolidation will be achieved, would be helpful in mitigating a major uncertainty that would otherwise endure.", "More positively, recent Fed actions have actually reduced uncertainty.", "Specifically, the Fed has provided greater certainty by indicating that its policy rate could be expected to remain at extremely low levels until mid-2015.", "It has also provided more certainty with respect to its reaction function, linking future unconventional monetary policy to substantial improvements in the outlook for the U.S. labour market.", "In addition, the Fed has indicated that it will leave highly accommodative policy in place \"for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\"", "If conditions were to deteriorate and further easing were required, the U.S. central bank could provide even greater certainty with further refinements, such as precise numerical targets and a time frame for achieving these targets.", "The Fed did not just sharpen communication, it also announced its intention to purchase $40 billion in securities per month - a strategy nicknamed \"QE3.\"", "As with previous rounds of monetary stimulus, QE3 can be expected to support the American recovery, both directly by lowering interest rates, and more broadly, through the so-called portfolio-balance effect.", "This channel tends to lift asset prices and reduce the value of the U.S. dollar.", "The overall impact of QE3 for Canada is estimated to be modestly positive, reflecting its supportive implications for U.S. and global activity and the resulting boost to commodity prices.", "What does all this mean for Canada?", "Elevated global uncertainty is holding back global economic growth and, thus, the demand for Canadian exports.", "In addition, there is some evidence that global uncertainty is affecting domestic activity.", "According to the Bank's most recent quarterly Business Outlook Survey, released this morning, Canadian firms have become more circumspect about new capital expenditures and less inclined to hire new workers.", "In this environment of slow global economic growth and uncertainty about demand, firms have also tempered their sales expectations for the next 12 months.", "However, while Canada's economy is being affected by the global angst, the key areas of uncertainty abroad are all points of justifiable confidence here at home.", "Canada's public finances are sound.", "Monetary policy is clear and credible.", "Canada's financial system showed itself to be among the most resilient in the world through the crisis.", "Since then, it has strengthened further.", "One thing Canadian businesses can expect is that their financial system will be there if times get tough again.", "In this uncertain world, then, Canada is rightly viewed as an attractive investment destination.", "This is having an important effect on Canadian financial conditions.", "Capital inflows are tending to push up the value of our dollar, thus acting as a headwind to the Canadian economy.", "However, foreign capital is also tending to push domestic asset prices up and longer-term interest rates down, which has a supportive effect on domestic growth.", "The Bank takes all of this into account when setting monetary policy.", "The Bank provides as much certainty as it can in the conduct of monetary policy.", "While we obviously cannot determine events over which we have no control, we can be transparent about what we expect and how we would react to different scenarios.", "That includes being clear about the role of monetary policy in supporting financial stability in Canada.", "For example, if we were to lean against emerging imbalances in household debt, we would clearly declare we are doing so and indicate how long we expect it would take for inflation to return to the 2 per cent target.", "Eighty years ago, faced with a more dire set of economic circumstances than we are today, Franklin D.
