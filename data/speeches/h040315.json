followed by a deep crisis, a rapid decline of the currency and great poverty.", "Economic and monetary policies have invariably been of major - if not crucial - significance in this.", "More than 100 years ago, the Bankers' Magazine encapsulated the role of politics in Argentina when its stated that \"Everything in Argentina's national life, whether industrial, commercial or financial, begins and ends in politics.", "\"1 That statement is confirmed by the economic developments of past two decades.", "For one thing, mistaken economic policy decisions - especially government debt getting out of

1990s succeeded in stabilising the economy and the currency.", "In the first half of the 1990s, Argentina managed to match the economic success it had enjoyed at the beginning of the twentieth

particular, the international financial markets.", "That is because special priority is to be assigned to the objective of regaining access to the international financial markets as soon as possible.", "Argentina should not rely on being able to cover its financing needs via the international financial institutions on a long-term basis.", "In this connection, it should be called to mind yet again that Argentina has been in debt to the IMF, for example, for an uninterrupted period of more than two decades accompanied by sometimes considerable rates of increase.", "Argentina has to compete for funding with other emerging economies on the international financial markets.", "To utilise its potential, create economic growth and jobs, and, especially, to combat poverty, Argentina

exemplary relations with its creditors.", "It is important to re-establish such relations.", "The treatment of investors over the past two years has destroyed much of that stock of confidence - not just for Argentina.", "At this point, it is worth noting that - in contrast to flows of capital to South East Asia - total inflows of private capital to Latin America went down by half last year

seriously.", "In Argentina, there are two problem areas which need a rapid and constructive solution.", "Reform of the banking sector: recapitalisation of the banks is urgently required; compensation

soon as possible.", "The tax on financial transactions is not conducive to strengthening the banking system either.", "Restructuring Argentina's debt.", "International investors naturally also

of doubts in some quarters about the preferred creditor status of the IMF and World Bank.", "That status, which has hitherto been observed without qualification, must not be called into question on account of the possible far-reaching implications it might have for the Fund's role in overcoming disruptions to the balance of payments.", "Economic reforms The political mood in Latin America has recently turned against a market-economy-oriented policy in some cases.", "Many people in Latin America associate reforms with weak growth, low incomes and unemployment.", "The term \"reform\" does not do justice to what the word implies, however, and is used for measures that, looked at objectively, can hardly be described as real reforms.", "It therefore comes as no surprise that positive results fail to materialise and that people talk of \"reform fatigue\".", "The current issue of the magazine takes an in-depth look at the subject of reform fatigue and the resurgence in populism.", "It describes populism as \"Latin America's chronic political disease\" and states that \"Voters may be attracted to populism, but it cannot deliver long-term growth because it repels private capital

comprehensive process of reform was begun in Latin America.", "Macroeconomic policy concentrated on the problem of stabilisation, while structural reforms promoted growth.", "In 1995 in Mexico, the

start of the 1990s.", "Finally, well over a year ago, Brazil was able to regain investors' confidence with a comprehensive reform programme.", "Of course, here - like in the industrial countries - a key debate is taking place on how far, how quickly and at what time structural reforms can or should be implemented.", "From a European perspective, there are two points to be made here based on general experience.", "Structural reforms make economies more flexible and therefore less susceptible to shocks.", "This flexibility and the avoidance of excessive government intervention enhances the efficiency of the economy.", "If reforms are implemented in a credible manner, the confidence of both investors and consumers is strengthened.", "Such a strengthening of confidence compensates for potential short-term negative effects on the economy.", "Furthermore, there is the question of what the macroeconomic costs of failure to act would be.", "Experience in Europe also confirms that structural reforms combined with a properly structured fiscal consolidation bring positive economic results even in the short term.", "Washington Consensus Examples in Latin America show that a turnaround for the better is possible.", "What has been the key to success?", "In 1989, John Williamson, Senior Fellow at the Institute for International Economics, drew up a kind of basic canon of recommendable reform policies for Latin America and coined the term \"Washington Consensus\" for this.", "Specifically, this involves the following policies: (1) macroeconomic stability as an indispensable prerequisite for economic growth, (2) redistribution of public expenditure in favour of healthcare, education and the infrastructure, (3) tax reform with the goal of a broader assessment base and lower marginal tax rates, (4) liberalisation of the financial sector including interest rates, (5) creation of a competitive exchange rate, (6) liberalisation of trade, (7) dismantling restrictions on foreign direct investment, (8) privatisation of state-owned enterprises, (9) deregulation to make the economy more competitive, and (10) safeguarding rights of ownership.", "The Washington Consensus has been misinterpreted - often unwittingly and sometimes quite intentionally.", "For many, it is synonymous with \"cold Neoliberalism\" and \"market fundamentalism\".", "Such interpretations are obviously at variance with the reforms I have just listed.", "Slogans such as \"minimal state\" or \"free, unfettered movement of capital\" are nowhere to be found among the ten points.", "After all, this has nothing to do with promoting a particular ideology but is simply a matter of applying economic laws in a market framework.", "A further misinterpretation concerns the reform programme's relationship with the international institutions which have their headquarters in Washington.", "There are some people who claim that it was the power of these institutions that had triggered the reforms in Argentina.", "Such interpretations obviously overestimate the impact of this programme, however.", "Incidentally, these reforms were no more than the lowest common denominator that prevailed in Washington in the early 1990s.", "As I see it, all the reform polices recommended by the Washington Consensus retain their full validity even today for Argentina and Latin America in general.", "That also goes for exchange rate policy.", "The 1991 decision to peg the peso to the US dollar through a currency board was right for Argentina at the time.", "After years of hyperinflation, the currency board was an important and successful element of Argentina's stabilisation strategy.", "Over the years, however, the strict pegging to the US dollar handicapped the country's international competitiveness - the introduction of more flexible arrangements at an earlier stage would therefore have been better.", "Even those who supported a currency board now admit that floating the peso at the end of the 1990s would have been beneficial for Argentina.", "By the way, the Bundesbank has always pointed out as a matter of principle that, when a currency board regime is introduced, those charged with responsibility for policy should always have an exit strategy as well.", "I wish to stress once again that the elements of the Washington Consensus are still valid today.", "How the elements are implemented - in other words, in what sequence and at what pace - depends on the particular circumstances in the country concerned.", "Reform Consensus \"plus\" Having said that, it would seem appropriate to give some thought to augmenting the consensus, a \"Consensus plus\".", "For me, this concerns two points in particular: 1. the importance of sound institutions, and 2. the social dimension of economic developments.", "Recently, the debate on economic reforms has undergone a shift of emphasis.", "Without doubt, stabilityoriented macropolicy is still key.", "Alongside the continuing unquestioned importance of issues such as privatisation combined with market liberalisation, deregulation and a general limitation of government activity, the public institutional conditions for the appropriate functioning of the markets have come more sharply into focus of late.", "Essentially, this concerns the role the institutions play in a country's economic development.", "Sound institutions play a part in reducing a country's susceptibility to external and internal negative shocks.", "More than anything else, it is the crises in emerging markets during the past ten years which have clearly revealed what grave implications non-existent or unsound institutions can have.", "Institutions anchor sovereign action in a reliable framework and can improve the consistency and continuity of political measures.", "Strong institutions are needed for good policy to become effective.", "That also applies to central banks which have to be independent of political influence.", "If, say, the domestic financial markets of emerging economies are only inadequately developed, the countries often tend towards an unsound debt structure by borrowing in the excessively short term and in foreign currency.", "Moreover, some emerging markets liberalised the financial sector relatively quickly without a parallel adequate strengthening of the banks' risk management and of the oversight and supervisory institutions.", "Since last year, the most important industrial and emerging countries represented in the G-20 have been taking an in-depth look at the importance of sound institutions.", "There is a general consensus that susceptibility to crises can be reduced if a country establishes efficient domestic capital markets and creates independent supervisory institutions to oversee the financial intermediaries and markets.", "Broad, deep and liquid domestic financial markets can alleviate tensions if access to the international financial markets should deteriorate at some time.", "What is also crucial is the development of a modern and efficient payment system in which the central bank is actively involved.", "Various studies have shown that the direct involvement of the central bank in payment system operations is advantageous, above all, for emerging markets.", "Above and beyond that, the legal system is an integral component of a given country's institutional framework and is of major importance for the satisfactory functioning of the financial system.", "That implies a credible statutory framework for monetary and fiscal policies, including the independence of the central bank, rules on competition and regulations for corporate governance.", "A sound legal system guarantees the freedom and fulfilment of contracts and the enforcement of private rights of ownership.", "Of importance are appropriate and unambiguous rules and regulations which are rigorously enforced by the courts of law.", "The second point concerns the social dimension in the sense of creating social security systems and, amongst other things, promoting education and training.", "This social dimension, however, could also be understood in the sense of a social market economy based on the German model that was successfully applied by Ludwig Erhard more than half a century ago.", "Social market economy The concept of the social market economy is based on economic freedom safeguarded by the rule of law.", "This is supplemented by arrangements pertaining to social security and equitable distribution.", "According to this concept, economic activity is a matter for the private sector, while the government's policy sets the framework in which economic activity unfolds (or Ordnungspolitik as it is known in Germany).", "The social market economy requires and encourages competition and entrepreneurship, a sense of personal responsibility and a readiness to take risks.", "The \"social\" element in the market economy concept means that market freedom is restricted on social grounds in those areas where it produces socially undesirable outcomes.", "Furthermore, the results of the economic process should be corrected in those places where they do not appear social enough in the light of society's values.", "A properly understood social policy envisages a subsidiary role for the state.", "The duties of the state should be confined to providing financial insurance against existential risks, such as illness and old age, and to promoting education and training.", "Unfortunately, we in Germany have moved away from these principles of the social market economy during the past 30 years.", "We have overextended the welfare state and, by doing so, overstrained the capacity of our economy.", "For that reason, an in-depth discussion on reverting to the principles of the social market economy has got under way.", "Given the country's generous social safety net, social policy for Germany means that transfer payments should be restricted to those groups of persons who are really in need.", "For Latin America, the weight of basic social problems means that other priorities are likely to apply.", "For both Europe and Latin America, however, it remains equally important that the emphasis on social aspects of the market economy does not result in the efficiency of the economy being impaired.", "The difficulty of pushing through reforms is something of which we in Germany are only too well aware.", "We are emerging from a three-year period of stagnation in which potential growth declined.", "Every effort therefore has to be made to raise potential growth to a sustained higher level again.", "A number of reforms have now been initiated.", "Nevertheless, the adopted reforms can be no more than a first step.", "We in Germany need an all-embracing modernisation of society, government and the economy.", "The Governor of the Mexican central bank, Guillermo Ortiz, recently made a call for Latin America's reform fatigue to be overcome.", "I concur in that objective and would like to stress, in particular, that greater efforts in terms of creating sound institutions could play a major part in achieving it.", "That applies not just to emerging markets in Latin America but also to many industrial countries.", "Argentina has a number of difficult years behind it.", "At the same time, the people of Argentina will have a better future to look forward to if it mobilises its own abilities and strengths.", "Argentina is a country with great potential.", "What is now needed is to strengthen that self-belief and to use the economic potential that is available."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
