climate.", "But the immediate impact is clear: ASEAN countries will be negatively impacted by the US-China trade conflict.", "The heightened uncertainty over trade is already beginning to erode

resulted in a significant easing of financial conditions globally, and helped lift sentiments in the near term.", "The impact on the real economy-in particular, investment-is expected to be modest.", "Ultra-easy monetary policy in the past decade has had limited effect on capital spending, which continues to be driven by real factors such as policy certainty, demographics, and productivity growth.", "I believe the Fed remains alert to risks on both sides: a sharper than expected slowdown in growth as well as an unexpected pick-up in inflation.", "And that it will be prepared to move in either direction.", "The easing of global financial conditions arising from the Fed's pause will provide Asia with some relief and policy space.", "Heightened volatility in capital flows and exchanges rates last year had led to a tightening of financial conditions across Asia.", "The pressures on the current account and exchange rates have receded following prompt measures by Asian countries to

impact of the recently announced Budget does not change the outlook for growth or for inflation.", "Although the government expects to run a deficit in this Budget, the fiscal impulse - which measures the impact of actual spending that flows through the economy in a given year - will be neutral in FY2019.", "The measures announced in the Budget are expected to have a muted effect on core inflation this year and the next.", "Question: The outlook for the Fed's balance sheets has changed.", "Where do you see financial vulnerabilities brewing in the world, as we advance towards quantitative tightening?", "There are two things worth keeping in mind with respect to the Fed's balance sheet runoff.", "First, the Fed has moved away from its previous guidance that the run-off will be on \"autopilot.\"", "The Fed has signalled that the balance sheet run-off will end sooner than earlier anticipated.", "It has also said it is prepared to alter the size and composition of its balance sheet if future economic conditions warrant such a move.", "This suggests that the withdrawal of central bank liquidity could be less than earlier envisaged.", "Second, the Fed has not changed its policy of running down its balance sheet at a rate of up to US$50 billion a month.", "This means that the path for liquidity conditions remains on a tightening trajectory and longterm interest rates could back up higher.", "The notes of caution that central banks, regulators, and analysts have been sounding about the need for entities to manage down their leverage remain valid.", "I believe systemic financial risk is contained - in the US as well as major financial markets.", "Leverage in the financial industry has come down significantly compared to before the global financial crisis.",

financial crisis.", "In the US, non-financial corporate debt has risen sharply, spurred by years of very low interest rates.", "The underwriting of some of this debt has been quite weak.", "f the business environment turns for the worse and cash flows dry up, corporate debt defaults could snowball.", "This is not likely to be a systemic problem, but it could create disruptions.", "Leverage ratios have also risen sharply in several Asian economies - corporate leverage in some, household leverage in others.", "Corporate earnings have not gone up in tandem with the rise in leverage, signalling weaker repayment ability under interest rate stress.", "Households, which have taken on more leverage on the back of low interest rates, might be more vulnerable to shocks in housing prices.", "If economic growth were to slow down significantly or interest rates rise sharply, these high levels of leverage could set off financial stresses - again, not of a systemic nature but troublesome nonetheless.", "IMF World Economic Outlook, January 2019.", "The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) index rose from 124.2 at the start of 2018 to a record 311.8 in December, before
