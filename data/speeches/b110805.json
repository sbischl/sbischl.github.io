wealth for the people.", "In terms of financing, it should be noted that with the new arrangement, the government would be able to access more non concessional financing which remain key for infrastructure development necessary for economic development.", "This is in contrast with the previous status whereby Zambia could only access limited concessional financing which attracted very low

external sector performance supported by the mining sector, and activities in key economic sectors, including agriculture and tourism, as well as strong external balance position after huge debt relief from international creditors obtained in 2005.", "The rating puts the Zambian business community and government in a strong position to access finance globally at risk adjusted interest rates for investment that is essential for sustained economic growth and improved living conditions of the citizens.", "Furthermore, the rating entails transparency in the economic management of the country's resources and provides an opportunity for the country to work on the weaknesses identified by the rating agencies.", "For instance, from the rating report it was noted that Zambia still faces challenges in the energy sector and infrastructure development.", "It therefore, follows that once the country addresses the identified weaknesses, the rating could improve.", "In summary, the rating assigned to Zambia shows stability and predictability of government policies and signals improvements in the business environment.", "This is also comparable to our peers in Africa.", "With
