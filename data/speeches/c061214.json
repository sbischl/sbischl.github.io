or financial stability.", "To put it bluntly, the failure of a number of households to meet their obligations to their credit institutions is not necessarily a financial stability problem.", "In the past year, the IMF has visited Denmark in connection with its FSAP, Financial Sector Assessment Program.", "As in other member countries, the IMF assessed the structure of the Danish financial system.", "A report will be published within a month or so.", "In connection with the FSAP a stress test was conducted to assess whether the Danish financial system is robust to cyclical changes.", "The basis for the stress test included Danmarks Nationalbank's macro model, MONA, and a stress test module that we have estimated.", "The worst-case scenario applied by the IMF involves a slowdown of the domestic economy, exacerbated by monetary-policy tightening by the ECB.", "House prices will fall by 30 per cent and GDP by 3 per cent over a 3-year period.", "The result of Danmarks Nationalbank's stress test is shown in Chart 4, where the blue line represents the actual, historical losses to the banks, while the yellow line shows modelled calculations of the historical development, and the broken line is the expected development, given the stress scenario.", "According to the calculations, the banks' average losses would increase to almost 1.5 per cent of loans and guarantees.", "This is somewhat lower than in the early 1990s, when losses and provisions reached 2.5 per cent on average.", "Overall, the Danish financial system is therefore reasonably robust.", "Nevertheless, a few banks may suffer substantially higher losses, just as there were banks in the early 1990s that lost more than 10 per cent.", "Stress testing will be given higher priority in our future assessments of financial stability.", "Our ambition is to learn more about how the banks affect each other and the economy in stress situations.", "Another task for Danmarks Nationalbank in relation to financial stability is to ensure that Denmark has a secure and effective financial infrastructure that can safely be used for settlement of payments, securities trading and other financial transactions.", "Danmarks Nationalbank now has a statutory obligation to oversee payment and settlement systems in Denmark.", "Part of the IMF's FSAP was to assess the core elements of the Danish financial infrastructure in relation to international standards.", "The IMF recommended a few changes.", "Danmarks Nationalbank will work with those responsible for the systems to ensure that the necessary improvements are made.", "However, we will not blindly adhere to all recommendations.", "For example, the IMF recommends that we establish a buffer pool to ensure the settlement of securities transactions and retail payments even if the largest participant is not able to settle its payment obligations.", "Danmarks Nationalbank finds that the best safeguard is to ensure that participants have easy and flexible access to liquidity, combined with participants' large portfolios of securities that can be pledged as collateral for loans from Danmarks Nationalbank.", "Consequently, we do not currently see any need for special measures to ensure settlement in the Danish systems.", "A third area that we are looking at is situations where the financial system is affected by dramatic external events.", "These could be acts of terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disasters or other situations where the financial system threatens to collapse.", "Danmarks Nationalbank chairs a task force to ensure coordination of the financial institutions' business continuity plans in such situations.", "Finally, Danmarks Nationalbank acts as lender of last resort to the Danish banks.", "Danmarks Nationalbank can extend loans to a bank that urgently needs liquidity and cannot procure it in the market, even though the bank is solvent.", "Fortunately, we are seldom called on to do that.", "Should a situation occur where it is necessary to rescue an ailing bank, Danmarks Nationalbank's position is that a market-based solution should be found.", "Nothing definite can be said beforehand about Danmarks Nationalbank's role.", "It would depend on a concrete assessment of the situation and the - direct or indirect - consequences for the Danish banking system and Danish society.", "However, we can look at what Danmarks Nationalbank has done on previous occasions.", "In a number of cases, Danmarks Nationalbank has played a role in connection with public intervention to help ailing banks - by providing financial assistance or expertise.", "Each time the situation has been so serious that it could potentially have a negative impact on the Danish banking system or cause foreign banks to lose faith in Danish banks.", "The initial step has been to provide stand-by liquidity facilities so as to give the bank in question some room to manoeuvre.", "However, Danmarks Nationalbank has also provided guarantees to creditors jointly with the private banks - often on the basis of a government guarantee.", "In several cases, the involvement of Danmarks Nationalbank has been conducive to a solution with the participation of private banks.", "A classic example of our role as lender of last resort was an episode in the summer of 1992 when there were rumours that Unibank was facing difficulties.", "Since it was Denmark's second largest bank, it was certainly a bank that was of significance to the Danish banking system.", "The episode coincided with the banking crisis in the other Nordic countries and is mentioned in Danmarks Nationalbank's Report and Accounts 1992: \"Early in the summer, rumours arose that Unibank was facing difficulties.", "These rumours were immediately disproved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, but in order to counter any liquidity problems abroad for Danish banks as a consequence of the rumours concerning a bank which did comply with the solvency requirements, the Nationalbank made a stand-by agreement with Unibank to supply liquidity if necessary, cf.", "the Nationalbank's press release of June 21, 1992.\"", "As we know, Unibank pulled through.", "Finally, I would like to draw attention to a challenge that we are facing.", "In the banking area, financial integration is at a more advanced level in the Nordic region than in the rest of the EU, and most large banks have branches or subsidiaries in other Nordic countries.", "The most prominent example is Nordea, which has significant market shares in each of the Nordic countries (except Iceland) - in Denmark's case almost a quarter of all deposits.", "EU legislation has contributed to harmonising the basis for conducting activities in the financial sector and removed barriers to cross-border operations.", "This is part of the process to create a single financial market in the EU.", "Nordea currently operates with a subsidiary structure, so that the national authorities are still responsible for supervision and oversight of its activities in each country.", "For Nordea Danmark, this responsibility lies with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority.", "This will change if Nordea - as announced some years ago - chooses to merge into one bank with branches in the various countries.", "In that case, the authorities in its home country - presumably Sweden - would have the principal responsibility for activities in Denmark, just as the Danish authorities currently supervise e.g.", "Danske Bank's activities in its Swedish branch.", "That is how the EU legislation is designed.", "This legislation is suitable if a bank has a relatively small branch in another country.", "However, the Swedish authorities cannot hold responsibility for Nordea's impact on financial stability in Denmark.", "It is still Denmark's responsibility that our financial system functions - even if we do not have insight into almost one quarter of the Danish banking market.", "Consequently, Danmarks Nationalbank is of the opinion that where large branches are involved that may affect financial stability in another member state, we need more binding cooperation between the authorities of the home country and the host country than EU legislation provides for.", "Both the supervisory authorities and the central banks in the Nordic countries have concluded collaboration agreements relating to cross-border financial enterprises.", "We have a long-standing tradition for Nordic cooperation, and presumably we will be able to negotiate the necessary insight into large Danish branches of banks domiciled in other Nordic countries, and vice versa.", "However, the system should also be designed to handle business integration between north and south within the EU.", "In this respect, the tradition for cooperation is less well-established than among the Nordic countries.", "It may therefore be necessary to rethink the EU legislation so that the individual member states are still empowered to safeguard financial stability - even with the presence of large foreign branches whose operations may have an impact on the financial system.", "The EU needs a legal handle to ensure that the authorities of the host country gain the necessary insight into a large branch of a foreign bank.", "The problem is naturally not acute, but amendments to EU legislation take their time, and we do not know when the need may arise.", "This is an issue that we will pursue in cooperation with other Danish authorities."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Financial stability", "Financial crises", "Stress testing", "Lending growth", "Credit risk", "Household debt", "Interest rate risk", "Financial infrastructure", "Lender of last resort", "Nordic financial integration"]}
