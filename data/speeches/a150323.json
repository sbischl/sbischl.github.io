Empower and facilitate all citizens to earn such levels of income that they can buy these services from the open market.", "Issue to contemplate is whether this can be done in a short term or even in the medium term.", "Then would it be fair to assume that a combination of above two would be a more realistic goal to pursue for quite some time to come considering the dimension of the work

should also be placed on inculcating savings habit among the people.", "Once the saving habits take root, people would look for investments.", "Only then this massive exercise would be meaningful.", "Direct benefit transfer 14.", "In order for the new bank account holders to continue to remain engaged with the formal financial system, Government's DBT program is expected to play a big role.", "It would ensure that the benefits are transferred directly to the targeted population and the leakages are avoided.", "Licensing of payment and small finance banks 15.", "With the objective of furthering

formal banking system.", "Focus on skill development 20.", "Globally, most students after completing their class 12th are considered to be ready for a job as the education system prepares them for a vocation of their choice.", "In India, however, the lack of employment opportunities after getting the basic education necessarily results in two outcomes - one of disillusionment with the education system and second, keep on pursuing higher education for want of a job.", "Dearth of formal vocational education, high school dropout rates, inadequate skill training capacity, negative perception towards skilling, lack of industry ready skills even in professional courses, continue to stand out as some of the major causes of poor skill levels and lack of entrepreneurship in India's workforce.", "There is a pressing need to scale up the skills of the unorganized workforce within the sector as well as those of the MSME employers through training inputs.", "Integrating the skill development initiatives with secondary and intermediate level education would address the challenge of low education levels and also provide school dropouts with employability skills.", "It is heartening to note that the Government is committed to encourage entrepreneurship in the country through a revision of the national skill development policy of 2009 so that schemes of different ministries can be routed through the newly formed skills ministry.", "This would be vital considering the current Government's thrust on \"Make In India.\"", "Before I conclude, let me raise a few concerns which can be detrimental to the consolidation and furtherance of the significant work done in the area of financial inclusion and poverty alleviation in the recent past.", "Is too much demand being placed on the banking system resources?", "The banks are presently almost alone expected to identify & enrol new customers, educate them, conduct Aadhaar registration, carry out administration

service standards etc.", "\u2022 Loan waiver schemes or employment not resulting into creation of social infrastructure /productive assets raise risk to broader work culture/credit culture in \u2022 Non-adherence to basic economic discipline by the states eg.", "in fixing the Minimum Support Price can be counterproductive in the long run \u2022 Weakened Governance and multiplicity of regulations in the co-operative sector- Are we doing enough to exploit potential of co-operative sector?", "\u2022 Need we draw lessons from the history of RRBs while pursuing BC model?", "Then there are two larger issues- one each in respect of rural and urban poverty alleviation \u2022 Don't we need a new model to enhance productivity & stop further fragmentation of already smaller land holding - Are DBT/interest subvention long-term answers to these problems?", "\u2022 Migration from rural India and rapid urbanization is a reality with social, infrastructural, employment and inclusion dimensions - are we adequately prepared to deal with them?", "It must thus be appreciated that poverty alleviation is a long drawn process and needs support from all quarters - the Government, other policy makers, the media and the society at large.", "Each one needs to do his/her bit to ensure that the poverty is defeated so that prosperity thrives.", "An ecosystem needs to be created which can fight
