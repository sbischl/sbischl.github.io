communities find ways to help residents turn what they know and do best, including skills they may have gained from industries in decline, into profitable small businesses.", "One example of a community taking this approach is Clarksdale, Mississippi.", "About 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made Clarksdale special and how those characteristics could help the community thrive.", "Since Clarksdale calls itself \"Home of the Blues,\" attracting tourists using the local Blues culture seemed promising.", "Over the years, Clarksdale has created new jobs by investing to improve its downtown, and has supported local businesses that cater to tourists interested in the community's musical heritage.", "This growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism-- businesses such as Urgent and Primary Care of Clarksdale.", "Dr. Mary Williams opened her urgent care facility last spring, partly in response to the closure of nearby Quitman

Hornbeck.", "The Hornbecks grew up in DeWitt, starting and eventually selling a successful business built on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the South.", "More recently, they have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil from local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to grow locally.", "This cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community college, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a Community Development Financial Institution, or CDFI, among others.", "While still in the early stages, it has led to the creation of several new businesses and imbued the town with a new sense of what is possible.", "Entrepreneurs such as the Hornbecks and Dr. Williams need support to succeed, the kind of support HBCUs and other institutions of higher education have long provided.", "MVSU itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the HBCU Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative, which teaches students how to start and grow a business.", "But inspiring stories like these are not as common as they could be.", "Entrepreneurship has the potential to play a greater role in poor rural areas, particularly in areas whose residents are predominantly black and other people of color.", "Recent surveys have found relatively high levels of interest in owning businesses among young people of color.", "Indeed, nationwide, black women represent one of the fastest growing groups of entrepreneurs.", "Yet research by the Federal Reserve suggests people of color experience greater challenges in gaining access to credit to start or expand businesses, which leads me to my last topic and the focus of this forum: access to financial services.", "Access to Financial Services Access to safe and affordable financial services is vital, especially among families with limited wealth--whether they are looking to invest in education, start a business, or simply manage the ups and downs of life.", "Family income and savings represent the largest source of funding for students' education.", "However, more than half of students or their families also borrow to finance their studies.", "And racial wealth disparities make black students more likely than white students to borrow for their education.", "Similarly, See FRB Kansas
