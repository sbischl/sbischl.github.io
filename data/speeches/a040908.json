are expected to become visible, laying stronger foundations for a gradual recovery in private consumption.", "Corporate sector It is accurate to say that Japan's current recovery is due to the

with financial system fragility.", "Corporate restructuring has spread from large manufacturers to nonmanufacturers and small businesses, producing tangible results.", "The ratio of current profits to

banks when they dispose of NPLs, have clearly been on a declining trend.", "The financial soundness of banks and the managerial soundness of borrowers are two sides of the same coin.", "In this

developments While the corporate goods price index, particularly raw materials and intermediate goods, has been rising partly because of higher crude oil prices, the consumer price index (CPI) has been on a slight downtrend.", "A small decline in the CPI is largely due to the unit labor cost reductions in the corporate sector reflecting higher productivity and the restraint on labor costs.", "Thus, the outlook for prices depends on future developments in productivity and wages.", "Three factors underpin the rise in productivity.", "First, resources are being used more efficiently as a result of the adjustment of excessive capital stock and labor as well as deregulation in a variety of areas, including the labor market.", "Second, progress continues in IT and technological innovation.", "Third, as is generally observed during an initial phase of economic recovery, higher utilization of labor and equipment is increasing productivity.", "While the third factor is cyclical, the first two factors could spur structural changes, raising the potential production capacity of Japan's economy.", "Many countries have experienced a situation in which prices do not necessarily increase in tandem with an upturn in economic activity.", "Economists and central bankers have been exploring a plausible explanation of this discrepancy.", "From the viewpoint of

should pay attention to the effects of higher crude oil prices on the general price level.", "Crude oil prices have been around record-high levels against the background of a rise in global demand and

"At home, higher crude oil prices may have a negative impact on corporate profits and households' spending behavior.", "Conduct of monetary policy Let me turn now to the conduct of monetary policy, bearing in mind the current situation in which prices are not increasing together with the economic recovery.", "The Bank has made a commitment to continue the current quantitative easing policy until the year-onyear change in the CPI registers zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis.", "Such a commitment is unusual for a central bank.", "Since the CPI is still on a declining trend, the Bank is determined to pursue an easy monetary policy even as the economy continues to recover.", "The positive impact of the current easy monetary policy on economic activity is strengthening as the economy recovers.", "The Bank's policy commitment allows firms to continue enjoying low funding costs through the stability of expectations about future interest rates.", "As the economic recovery raises the expected rate of return on new investment with interest rates remaining low, firms will become more inclined to undertake investment.", "We expect consumer prices to continue declining slightly year on year due to the decrease in rice prices in the fall as a flipside of the increase of last year, despite higher crude oil prices.", "So far, we have not observed any major changes in the discrepancy between economic activity and prices, productivity, and wages.", "It is our judgment that we remain at the stage where we should maintain the current commitment and firmly continue the quantitative easing policy.", "Eventually, we must return to the conventional monetary policy of using short-term interest rates as an operating target, from the current policy of using the current

balance at the Bank of Japan.", "Financial institutions have a legal obligation to hold about 6 trillion yen in the current account at the Bank as required reserves.", "At present, given the ample provision of liquidity by the Bank, they are holding 30 to 35 trillion yen in their current accounts, far exceeding the required reserves.", "The ample provision of liquidity has contributed greatly to financial market stability and thus prevented a deflationary spiral as it dispels concern about liquidity risk.", "As we return to the conventional policy framework, we will need to reduce the current account balance at the Bank.", "The other element involves the pace at which short-term interest rates, which are now virtually at zero, should be raised.", "How should we go through the process as we return to the conventional monetary policy?", "What is the most appropriate way to communicate our thinking on monetary policy as we eventually shift the policy?", "These are the

situation.", "Japan's economy is moving steadily toward achieving sustainable growth and overcoming deflation.", "The Bank is determined to support the private sector's efforts to move forward by
