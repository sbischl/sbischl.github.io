the resilience of the financial system and decreasing the build-up of systemic risks, thereby ensuring a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth\".", "On the other hand, the focus of is to safeguard individual financial micro-prudential supervision institutions from idiosyncratic risks and prevent them from taking too much risk, while ensuring the consumer protection

presentations addressed these aspects.", "\uf0b7 Financial inclusion and income inequality are more and more a subject of interest for central banks.", "It is a topic that was on the agenda of a previous financial stability seminar and also, and in my opinion, it deserves a special attention.", "\uf0b7 The papers discussed these days lead to the idea that higher financial inclusion will reduce inequality, but what I would like to emphasize is that in low income and developing countries in general, the most important factor in reducing inequalities stays within the national authorities competencies.", "\uf0b7 Proper economic policies must be implemented in order to ensure inclusive economic growth, which generates the reduction of inequality.", "As it was very well

that took place here, related to the soundness of the financial sector and the need to have financial services widely accessible, I would like to underline in which I strongly believe.", "two main points, The first one is that \"There is no financial inclusion without social inclusion\" As we look at the development indicators, we can notice, on the one hand, that significant quantitative

changes in the corporate decision-making are expected.", "The second point is that \"There is a strong link between financial stability, on the one hand, and capital and financial discipline, on the other.\"", "A competitive and stable economic framework has to ensure an appropriate balance between rights or liberties and obligations or accountability of entrepreneurs.", "While many efforts have

the competitiveness of the economy, which creates the conditions for reaching an optimal macroeconomic equilibrium.", "The segregation between freedom and responsibility at the level of firms

all the participants for attending the seminar and to the IMF for their constant support in organizing such useful debates.", "\uf0b7 As the purpose of the seminar is to discuss current financial stability challenges and to exchange knowledge in dealing with such challenges, I believe that the objective has been achieved during these two days event.", "\uf0b7 Finally, taking into account: first, the issues I have mentioned above; second, the direct and strong correlation between the capital and the real economy and third, the fact that the distinguished participants who will take part in the next year seminar can offer the possibility to share experience among countries and institutions, I would like to suggest that the 2020 event topic to be \"The capital in the real economy as a
