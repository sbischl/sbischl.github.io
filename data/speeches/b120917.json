a reciprocal version and a non-reciprocal version - were issued.", "Both versions establish a framework for reporting by financial institutions of certain financial account information to their respective tax authorities, followed by automatic exchange of such information under existing bilateral tax treaties or tax information exchange agreements.", "Both versions of the model agreement also address the legal issues that had been raised in connection with the FATCA, and simplify its implementation for financial institutions.", "The reciprocal version of the model also provides for the U.S. to exchange information currently collected on accounts held in U.S. financial institutions by residents of partner countries, and includes a policy commitment to pursue regulations and support legislation that would provide for equivalent levels of exchange by the U.S.", "The OECD has welcomed the conclusion of negotiations between the U.S. and the 5 European countries.", "The Secretary General of the OECD has in fact expressed the intent of the OECD to work closely with interested countries and stakeholders to design global solutions to global problems for the benefit of governments and businesses around the world.", "Where does this leave Mauritius?", "I believe that we also ought to be seeking to enter into Intergovernmental Agreements of the model types proposed by the U.S. We are on the OECD \"White List\" as a jurisdiction with acceptable tax standards in compliance with OECD norms and best-practice principles and adhere to international standards on transparency and exchange of information set by the OECD.", "We are also recognised by the World Bank, the IMF and the FATF as a clean and transparent jurisdiction with a sound legal, regulatory and supervisory framework.", "Information exchange in tax matters, indeed, ranks high on our agenda.", "With 36 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) in force, nine others awaiting ratification and 12 DTAAs under negotiation as well as half a dozen Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA) in place and others in the pipeline, Mauritius has demonstrated that it is committed to the concepts of transparency and effective exchange of information.", "In fact, to further improve the effectiveness of our exchange of information mechanism and allow us to provide assistance to our partners in the collection of foreign taxes, Mauritius proposes to become a party to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters which has been jointly developed by the OECD and the Council of Europe.", "Mauritius is definitely a jurisdiction of substance and has in place the necessary mechanisms for effective exchange of information in tax matters.", "Importantly, as at present, however, we do not have in place any income tax treaty or Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US, - a prerequisite to enter into Intergovernmental Agreements of the model types proposed by the US.", "Mauritius has never refused to sign an exchange of information agreement.", "We should, therefore, endeavour to pursue negotiations in this area with the US.", "However, even if an agreement were to be entered, when would it be reached?", "Would this leave us with sufficient time to meet the looming FATCA-deadline?", "Or would the OECD succeed in negotiating a third type of model agreement with the U.S. for those countries that do not have in place such treaties or agreements?", "Such questions touch upon issues well beyond the remit of the Bank.", "It is for this reason that at the level of the Bank, we have urged Government to consider setting up a collaborative platform comprising relevant stakeholders to reflect on the implications of the FATCA in Mauritius and take a concerted view regarding its implementation.", "I am very pleased that the collaborative platform has been constituted.", "A Joint Working Group comprising representatives of the Mauritius Bankers' Association (MBA) and the Bank has also been set up to evaluate the impact of FATCA on banks in Mauritius and I am very appreciative of the contribution from the MBA in this endeavour.", "Rest assured that the authorities are taking this matter seriously.", "What is certain at this stage is that we will have to comply with the FATCA.", "In some way or another.", "Yes, there are costs.", "Yes, it is cumbersome.", "And yes, the challenges are numerous.", "Yet, we have no choice but to comply.", "FATCA is here to stay.", "It would be a bad idea to ignore it.", "And an even worse idea not to comply with it.", "Instead of looking at the FATCA as the insurmountable monster, we should be considering how to use it to our advantage -
