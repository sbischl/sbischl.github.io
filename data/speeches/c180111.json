is the fact that contrary to the narrative by some Ugandan media commentators, the government of Kenya is only a minority shareholder in the KCB Group, holding about 18 percent of shares as at August 2016.", "Second, is a lesson for our business community in Uganda to strive to emulate our Kenyan counterparts in terms of foresight and discipline in managing our businesses so that we too can have Ugandan businesses successfully establishing base across the borders.", "My brief remarks will concentrate on examining developments in the financial sector in two parts.", "The first part will look at the last ten years of KCB Bank Uganda in our market;

the near universal use of technological solutions could entail increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and inadequacies with respect to compliance with Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing regulations.", "To respond to these new risks and vulnerabilities, our regulatory framework will also have to change fundamentally from the present focus on intermediaries or \"entity-based\" to more \"activity-based\" regulation in light of the complex network of transactions and players in financial services.", "In addition, our licensing regime will also need to be continually redesigned to bring new types of service providers within the regulatory ambit.", "The good news is that some of the emerging technologies may contribute to better regulation, because they could facilitate regulatory compliance and reduce compliance costs.", "The Bank of Uganda will be studying how some of these new technologies could be employed to enhance security, identify suspicious transactions and facilitate regulator-bank interactions.", "The key message to KCB Uganda and all the other Supervised Financial Institutions in Uganda is that the next decade is going to be a very challenging one.", "Technological advancement is going to present a lot of exciting benefits, but there will also be attendant risks.", "To survive and thrive, the banks must continuously institute robust risk management frameworks which are capable of prudently mitigating these risks in order to protect depositors' funds and ensure the soundness of the banks.", "With these remarks, I once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to KCB Uganda on this milestone of marking ten years of banking services in Uganda and I wish you many more fruitful years to come."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Financial technology", "Regulation", "Supervision", "Digital banking", "Innovation", "Financial inclusion", "Cyberattacks", "Anti-money laundering", "Anti-terrorism financing", "Risk management"]}
