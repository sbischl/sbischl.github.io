history, a minimum standard had been established for all internationally-active banks.", "Yet despite its breadth, the Basel I agreement was only 30 pages long.", "This brevity came courtesy of focussing on a limited set of credit risks measured at a broad asset class, rather than individual exposure, level.", "Only five different risk weights were defined under Basel I, varying from zero to 100%.", "Calculating regulatory capital ratios was possible using pad and pen.", "In taking this simplified approach, the Basel Committee fully recognised its limitations.", "It was recognised that the role of regulatory rules was not to capture every raindrop.", "Rather, they served as a backstop to banks' own risk assessments.", "Basel rules were there to support, not supplant, commercial risk decisions.", "During the 1990s, the bluntness of the risk judgements embodied in Basel I came increasingly to be questioned - and arbitraged.", "Basel I was perceived as lacking risk-sensitivity, at least by comparison with the new wave of credit and market risk models emerging at the time.", "Change came in 1996 with the Market Risk Amendment.", "This introduced the concept of the regulatory trading book and, for the first time, allowed banks to use internal models to calculate regulatory capital against market risk.", "With hindsight, a regulatory rubicon had been crossed.", "This was not so much the use of risk models as the blurring of the distinction between commercial and regulatory risk judgements.", "The acceptance of banks' own models meant the baton had been passed.", "The regulatory backstop had been lifted, replaced by a complex, commercial judgement.", "The Basel regime became, if not self-regulating, then self-calibrating.", "A revised Basel Accord, Basel II, was agreed in 2004.", "It followed closely in the footsteps of the trading book amendment.", "Internal risk models were allowed as a means of calibrating credit risk.", "Indeed, not so much permitted as actively encouraged, with internal models designed to deliver lower capital charges.", "By design, Basel II served as an incentive device for banks to upgrade their risk management technology.", "As a by-product, there was a step change in the granularity of the Basel framework.", "Risk exposures were no longer captured at a broad asset class level.", "And risk weights on these exposures were no longer confined to five buckets.", "That meant greater detail and complexity.", "Reflecting these changes, Basel II came in at 347 pages - an order of magnitude longer than its predecessor.", "The ink was barely dry on Basel II when the financial crisis struck.", "This exposed gaping holes in the agreement.", "In the period since, the response has been to fill the largest of these gaps, with large upwards revisions to the calibration of the Basel framework.", "Agreement on this revised framework, Basel III, was reached in 2010.", "In line with historical trends the documents making up Basel III added up to 616 pages, almost double Basel II.", "The length of the Basel rulebook, if anything, understates its complexity.", "The move to internal models, and from broad asset classes to individual loan exposures, has resulted in a ballooning in the number of estimated risk weights.", "For a large, complex bank, this has meant a rise in the number of calculations required from single figures a generation ago to several million today (Haldane (2011)).", "It also raises questions about regulatory robustness since it places reliance on a large number of estimated parameters.", "Across the banking book, a large bank might need to estimate several thousand default probability and loss-given-default parameters (Table 1).", "To turn these into regulatory capital requirements, the number of parameters increases by another order of magnitude.", "It is close to impossible to determine with complete precision the size of the parameter space for a large international bank's banking book.", "That, by itself, is revealing.", "But a rough guess would put it at thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of estimated and calibrated parameters.", "That is three, perhaps four, orders of magnitude greater than Basel I.", "If that sounds large, the parameter set for the trading book is almost certainly larger still.", "To give some sense of scale, consider model-based estimates of portfolio Value at Risk (VaR), a commonly-used technique for measuring risk and regulatory capital in the trading book.", "A large firm would typically have several thousand risk factors in its VaR model.", "Estimating the covariance matrix for all of the risk factors means estimating several million individual risk parameters.", "Multiple pricing models are then typically used to map from these risk factors to the valuation of individual instruments, each with several estimated pricing parameters.", "Taking all of this together, the parameter space of a large bank's banking and trading books could easily run to several millions.", "These parameters are typically estimated from limited past samples.", "For example, a typical credit risk model might comprise 20-30 years of sample data - barely a crisis cycle.", "A market risk model might comprise less than five years of data - far less than a crisis cycle.", "Regulatory complexity has also found its way into the numerator of the capital ratio - the definition of capital.", "Under Basel I, the focus was on common equity capital, with restrictions on non-equity instruments.", "Progressively, a complex undergrowth of new non-equity capital instruments began to emerge.", "Additional \"tiers\" of regulatory capital, and tiers within tiers, were added.", "In the end, it did all end in tears.", "During the crisis, investors lost confidence in non-equity capital instruments.", "Basel III simplified the definition of core regulatory capital, basing it around a common equity Tier 1 definition.", "Yet measuring capital remains a complex task.", "The numerator of the capital ratio adds dozens, perhaps hundreds, of parameters to the complexity quotient.", "This degree of complexity complicates greatly the task for investors pricing banks' financial instruments.", "For example, serious concerns have been expressed about the opacity of the Basel risk weights and their consistency across firms (Haldane (2011), Le Lesle\u0301 and Avramova (2012)).", "Their granularity makes it close to impossible to account for differences across banks.", "It also provides near-limitless scope for arbitrage.", "This degree of complexity also raises serious questions about the robustness of the regulatory framework given its degree of over-parameterisation.", "This million-dimension parameter set is based on the in-sample statistical fit of models drawn from short historical samples.", "If previous studies tell us it may take 250 years of data for a complex asset pricing model to beat a simple one, it is difficult to imagine how long a sample would be needed to justify a million-digit parameter set.", "(b) The legislative blanket Basel Accords are non-statutory.", "But since the 1980s, the trend has been towards underpinning these non-statutory agreements with national legislation or additional rule-making.", "At first, this was simple.", "The 30 pages of Basel I were translated into 18 pages in

"Contrast the legislative responses in the US to the two largest financial crises of the past century - the Great Depression and the Great Recession.", "The single most important legislative response to the Great Depression was the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.", "Indeed, this may have been the single most influential piece of financial legislation of the 20th century.", "Yet it ran to a mere 37 pages.", "The legislative response to this time's crisis, culminating in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, could not have been more different.", "On its own, the Act runs to 848 pages - more than 20 Glass-Steagalls.", "That is just the starting point.", "For implementation, Dodd-Frank requires an additional almost 400 pieces of detailed rule-making by a variety of US regulatory agencies.", "As of July this year, two years after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, a third of the required rules had been finalised.", "Those completed have added a further 8,843 pages to the rulebook.", "At this rate, once completed Dodd-Frank could comprise 30,000 pages of rulemaking.", "That is roughly a thousand times larger than its closest legislative cousin, Glass-Steagall.", "Dodd-Frank makes Glass-Steagall look like throat-clearing.", "The situation in Europe, while different in detail, is similar in substance.", "Since the crisis, more than a dozen European regulatory directives or regulations have been initiated, or reviewed, covering capital requirements, crisis management, deposit guarantees, short-selling, market abuse, investment funds, alternative investments, venture capital, OTC derivatives, markets in financial instruments, insurance, auditing and credit ratings.", "These are at various stages of completion.", "That total is set to increase dramatically as primary legislation is translated into detailed rule-writing.", "For example, were that rule-making to occur on a US scale, Europe's regulatory blanket would cover over 60,000 pages.", "It would make Dodd-Frank look like a warm-up Act.", "(c) The regulatory response The density and complexity of financial regulation has had predictable consequences for the scale and scope of regulatory resources.", "One metric for that would be the number of human resources devoted to financial regulation.", "In the UK up until the late-1970s, bank supervision was performed by the Bank of England on an informal basis, with a team of around 30 employees.", "Even when the Bank was given statutory responsibility in 1979, fewer than 80 people were engaged in the supervision of financial firms.", "In the period since, the number of UK financial supervisors has increased dramatically, rising almost forty-fold (Chart 1).", "In response to the current crisis, regulatory numbers are set to rise further.", "Over the same period, the number of people employed in the UK financial services sector has risen fractionally.", "In 1980, there was one UK regulator for roughly every 11,000 people employed in the UK financial sector.", "By 2011, there was one regulator for every 300 people employed in finance.", "The pattern in the US, looked at over a longer historical sweep, is broadly similar.", "The FDIC and SEC were set up as part of the regulatory response to the Great Depression.", "In 1935, together with the OCC and supervisors housed in the Federal Reserve banks, they had combined regulatory resources of around 4,500 people.", "There was one regulator for every three banks in the US (Chart 2).", "Today, the combined regulatory resources of the FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve banks and SEC is closer to 18,500 people.", "That is three regulators for every US bank.", "As numbers of regulators have risen, so too have regulatory reporting requirements.", "In the UK,

Reserve.", "By 1930, these reports might contain around 80 entries.", "Today, regulatory reporting is on an altogether different scale.", "Since 1978, the Federal Reserve has required quarterly

when predicting Alpine avalanches or Wimbledon winners, simpler weighting measures may be more robust.", "This is a testable proposition.", "To do so, we take a sample of about 100 large, complex global banks, defined as those with total assets over $100 billion at end-2006.15 These large banks are likely to hold a diverse array of assets and to use complex, internal models to calibrate regulatory capital against these assets.", "So at least in principle, risks to these banks should be better captured by granular, risk-sensitive capital measures.", "Von Neumann-Morgenstern

size expands, model uncertainty decreases and prediction errors fall.", "The performance of the complex models begins to improve relative to the simple ones.", "In general, prediction errors converge to a U-shaped pattern centred on the true model, with models which are either too simple or too complex inferior.", "This is a standard statistical finding.", "But it is only at sample sizes in excess of 100,000 days (400 years) that estimates of the \"true\" model outperform a much simpler one.", "Moreover, the simple model is only materially worse than complex models when the sample size rises to around 250,000 days (1,000 years).", "According to this experiment, the sample sizes which would be necessary for complex models to outperform much simpler ones are very large indeed.", "This

sample size is increased.", "But even with a sample size of three-quarters of a century, the simple models perform at least as well as the complex one.", "Another dimension to complexity is the number of assets in a portfolio.", "So consider a different portfolio of 200 equities since 1973.", "To reduce the risk that the results are portfolio-specific, we construct the maximum number of

using the EWMA and GARCH models.", "To keep things simple, these models are all estimated over a common sample period.", "The expected losses can then be compared with actual losses, allowing \"violation ratios\" for portfolios of differing sizes to be calculated.", "The results are summarised in Chart 19.", "For very simple portfolios of two or three assets, the performance of the simple and complex models is not so different.", "As the number of assets increases, however, the simple model progressively out-performs the complex one.", "That is a direct result of the uncertainties associated with over-fitting the complex model relative to the simple one.", "The message from these experiments is clear and consistent.", "Complexity of models or portfolios generates robustness problems when understanding a complex financial system over plausible sample sizes.", "More than that, simplicity rather than complexity may be better capable of solving these robustness problems.",

past.", "Einstein wrote that: \"The problems that exist in the world today cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them\".", "Yet the regulatory response to the crisis has largely been based on the level of thinking that created it.", "The Tower of Basel, like its near-namesake the Tower of Babel, continues to rise.", "An alternative point of reference when regulating a complex system would be to simplify and streamline the control framework.", "Based on the evidence here, this might be achieved through a combination of five, mutually-supporting policy measures: de-layering the Basel structure; placing leverage on a stronger regulatory footing; strengthening supervisory discretion and market discipline; regulating complexity explicitly; and structurally re-configuring the financial system.", "(a) Reconstructing the Tower of Basel The quest for risk-sensitivity in the Basel framework, while sensible in principle, has generated problems in practice.", "It has spawned startling degrees of complexity and an over-reliance on probably unreliable models.", "The Tower of Basel is at risk of over-fitting - and over-balancing.", "It may be time to rethink its architecture.", "A useful starting point might be to take a more sceptical view of the role and robustness of internal risk models in the regulatory framework.", "These are the main source of opacity and complexity.", "With thousands of parameters calibrated from short samples, these models are unlikely to be robust for many decades, perhaps centuries, to come.", "It is close to impossible to tell whether results from them are prudent.", "One simple response to that concern may be to impose strict limits, or floors, on model outputs.", "These would provide a binding regulatory backstop.", "There are precedents for such an approach.", "At the introduction of Basel II, temporary floors were introduced into aggregate capital requirements, set at 80% of Basel I requirements.", "And under the Collins amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks using internal models will be subject to a 100% floor based on the simpler standardised approach.", "But these measures only take us so far.", "Regulatory-imposed floors do little by themselves to simplify the underlying regulatory architecture.", "Only by removing internal models from the regulatory framework can this be achieved.", "As an alternative foundation stone, simplified, standardised approaches to measuring credit and market risk, on a broad asset class basis, could be used.", "Indeed, there have been already been small steps in this direction.", "A consultation document on the fundamental review of the trading book issued in May this year proposed a greater role for standardised approaches.", "This would be a turning back of the clock, restoring the regulatory framework as a backstop to commercial risk management.", "Legal rules and regulatory rules have followed a similar historical path.", "In response to crisis events and case law, both have evolved into a complex tapestry.", "In his book \"Simple Rules for a Complex World\", Richard Epstein suggests this legal tapestry can be unravelled into six basic threads (Epstein (1995)).", "The same unravelling ought to be possible in banking.", "(b) Leverage versus capital The Basel III framework will introduce for the first time an internationally-agreed leverage ratio - a 1/N rule.", "That is good news from a robustness perspective.", "Less good is the fact that there will be a clear hierarchy of solvency rules, with the frontstop provided by a risk-weighted capital ratio and with the leverage ratio serving as backstop.", "In the hierarchy, leverage will be second-in-line.", "At least for the world's largest and most complex banks - the ones for which Basel was designed - that hierarchy is difficult to justify.", "On the evidence presented here, the hierarchy should if anything be reversed, with the leverage ratio playing the frontstop role given its simplicity and superior predictive performance.", "The more complex the bank, the stronger is this case.", "The case against leverage ratios is that they may encourage banks to increase their risk per unit of assets, reducing their usefulness as an indicator of bank failure - a classic Goodhart's Law.", "Indeed, that was precisely the rationale for seeking risk-sensitivity in the Basel framework in the first place.", "A formulation which would avoid this regulatory arbitrage, while preserving robustness, would be to place leverage and capital ratios on a more equal footing.", "That is why, in its recommendations on macroprudential instruments, the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee has given capital and leverage ratios equal billing.", "The evidence presented here suggests that there may also be a case for reconsidering the measurement of equity capital.", "Basing this on market values rather than accounting cost is not only simpler, but appears superior as a guide to banks' dynamic viability.", "Certainly, adding market-based indicators of capital adequacy to regulators' and investors' indicator set would seem worthwhile.", "On calibration, at present Basel III rules prescribe a 3% leverage ratio - that is, banks' equity can in principle be leveraged up to 33 times.", "Most banks would say a loan-to-value ratio of 97% was imprudent for a borrower.", "A 3% leverage ratio means banks are just such a borrower.", "For the world's largest banks, the leverage ratio needed to guard against failure in this crisis would have been above 7%.", "The leverage ratio that would have minimised Type I and II crisis errors is around 4%.", "Both lie well above the current Basel backstop.", "(c) Pillars 1, 2 and 3 The Tower of Basel is underpinned by three pillars: Pillar 1 (regulatory rules); Pillar 2 (supervisory discretion); and Pillar 3 (market discipline).", "To date, the weight borne by these three pillars has been heavily unbalanced, with most of the strain taken by Pillar 1.", "Simplifying Pillar 1 rules would help rebalance the Basel scales.", "That would not only strengthen Pillar 1, but could simultaneously strengthen Pillars 2 and 3.", "A rebalancing away from prescriptive rules provides greater scope for supervisory judgement, Pillar 2.", "In other professions, such as medicine, prescriptive rules have generated a wood-from-trees problem.", "They have also caused defensive, backside-covering behaviour.", "Both may have increased risk in the system.", "What is true of doctors is almost certainly true of bank supervisors.", "In the pre-crisis period, being required to monitor many small, rule-based risks may have caused supervisors to overlook potentially life-threatening ones.", "This ticked-box approach failed to save the banks, just as in medicine it fails to save lives.", "Supervision suffered the same fate as the autistic savant - penny-wise but pound-foolish.", "Breaking free of that psychological state calls for a fresh approach, one which is less rules-focussed, more judgement-based.", "That alternative approach to financial supervision is beginning to be recognised.", "For example, this approach will underpin the Bank of England's new supervisory model when it assumes prudential regulatory responsibilities next year (Bank of England and FSA (2011)).", "Accompanying this will be a streamlined approach to regulatory reporting in the UK.", "In line with US reporting from the 1860s, more regulatory data will be available \"on call\".", "In future, the limits of Excel will hopefully no longer be tested.", "This will reduce the complexity quotient, making easier the wood-and-trees task for supervisors.", "It will also hopefully streamline compliance costs for both regulator and regulated.", "This approach does not come without risks.", "As when catching a frisbee or a criminal, catching crises relies on a lengthy sample of past experience.", "Good supervision means developing well-honed rules of thumb.", "So one of the secrets to making this new supervisory approach a success will be the accumulated experience of supervisory staff.", "That means having staff with a nose for a crisis (like a hedgehog) as well as ears and eyes (like a fox).", "Therein lies a dilemma.", "Galbraith observed that: \"There can be few fields of human endeavour in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance.", "A systemic crisis might only occur once or twice a century.", "Among risk managers, typical levels of experience are significantly less than a full crisis cycle.", "The same is true among bank supervisors.", "Historically, financial supervision has been long foxes and short hedgehogs.", "Ever-expanding numbers of regulators will not solve this problem - if anything, that may cause average levels of experience to fall, not rise.", "Nor will ever-expanding amounts of regulatory reporting - if anything, that breeds more complexity, not less.", "A strong case can be made for a reversal of the historical trajectory in which \"more is more\".", "This strategy has comprehensively, and repeatedly, failed the crisis test.", "This calls for a different supervisory direction of travel.", "Practically, that may mean fewer (perhaps far fewer), more (ideally much more) experienced supervisors, operating to a smaller, less detailed rulebook.", "That would reduce the risk of self-defeating defensive supervisory actions.", "It would mean being brave enough to allow less to deliver more.", "Market discipline, Pillar 3, would also be strengthened by simplified regulatory rules and practices.", "For investors today, banks are the blackest of boxes.", "One area of conspicuous darkness is banks' risk weights.", "More than half of all investors do not understand or trust banks' risk weights (Barclays Capital (2012)).", "Their multiplicity and complexity have undermined transparency and, with it, market discipline.", "Greater simplicity and consistency of risk weight information would help restore discipline.", "In 2009, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) asked banks to estimate the capital they would hold against a common hypothetical portfolio.", "Repeating that exercise internationally would shed some sunlight on international banks' capital treatment, helping restore market discipline.", "Beyond risk weights, there is a case for re-considering the wider disclosure agenda.", "Here again, more is not necessarily more.", "The explosion in banks' reporting over the past decade has not conspicuously helped in pricing bank risk.", "Important detail is often lost in the thicket of figures, with investors and regulators seeking the needle in the rising haystack of information.", "Cutting back the thicket, re-sizing the haystack, could actually enhance transparency and bolster market discipline.", "(d) Taxing complexity Until recently, complexity had not been penalised by the regulatory framework.", "To the contrary, by providing an explicit capital incentive to pursue internal models, the Basel framework effectively provided a subsidy to complexity.", "Conceptually, that is difficult to justify.", "Complexity has externality-type properties, making risk more difficult to monitor and manage, not less.", "Rather than subsidising it, there is a conceptually coherent case for taxing complexity within the regulatory framework.", "A degree of progress has already been made on this front.", "For example, the capital surcharge to be levied on the world's most systemically important institutions has been calibrated with half an eye on the complexity and connectivity of banks' balance sheets.", "And the recovery and resolution plans being drawn up for these same firms may, as a by-product, simplify corporate structures in banking.", "But there is a case for tackling complexity directly and at source.", "Recent events have re-demonstrated the problems that arise in risk-managing large, complex financial firms with multiple models and management information systems.", "They make the world's largest banks, arguably, too big to manage.", "At present, no explicit regulatory charge is levied on those complexity externalities.", "Doing so would help protect the system against failure, while providing explicit incentives to simplify balance sheets.", "What is true within firms is also true across them.", "Cross-system complexity has exploded over recent decades due to the growth in opaque, intra-financial system chains of exposure.", "That complexity externality is currently largely unrecognised and un-priced by regulatory rules.", "Indeed, under the current Basel rules intra-financial system exposures carry a much lower capital charge than exposures outside the financial sector.", "From a system-wide complexity perspective, this may be the wrong relative risk-ranking.", "(e) Structural change Over the past 30 years or so, the regulatory direction of travel has been towards pricing risk in the financial system, rather than prohibiting or restricting it.", "In the language of Weitzman, regulators have pursued price over quantity-based regulation (Weitzman (1974)).", "That makes sense when optimising in a risky world.", "It may make less sense when optimising in an uncertain world.", "Quantity-based restrictions may be more robust to mis-calibration.", "Simple, quantity-based restrictions are the equivalent of a regulatory commandment: \"Thou shalt not\".", "These are likely to be less fallible than: \"Thou shalt provided the internal model is correct\".", "That is one reason why Glass-Steagall lasted for 60 years longer than Basel II.", "Quantity-based regulatory solutions have gained currency during the course of the crisis.", "In the US, the Volcker rule is a quantity-based regulatory commandment: \"Thou shalt not engage in proprietary trading\".", "In the UK, the Independent (\"Vickers\") Commission on Banking has also proposed structural, quantity-based reforms: \"Thou shalt not co-mingle retail deposit-taking and investment banking\".", "Yet even these notionally simple, structural proposals run some risk of backdoor complexity.", "For example, the consultation document accompanying Volcker already runs to 298 pages.", "Were these proposals to become mired in detail, they risk sinking, like the Tower of Basel, into the swamp.", "This is not because these proposals go too far but because they may not go far enough.", "These reform efforts have too many commas, semi-colons and sub-clauses.", "They would benefit from a few more full stops.", "That logic suggests cleaner solutions than are currently being implemented, if not than are currently being contemplated.", "Strict size limits and forced separation of commercial and investment banking are two frequently cited such radical options (Haldane (2010), Fisher (2011), Johnson and Kwak (2010)).", "The debate on them has waxed and waned on both sides of the Atlantic.", "A stalemate has been reached.", "Having risen to a peak of almost three in 1928, the largest US banks' price-to-book ratios had by 1931 plummeted to below one.", "They remained close to these levels for several years afterwards (Chart 20).", "This discount implied that investors in the bank could improve their wealth by selling-off the banks' assets separately.",

City Bank in 1933.", "A number of banks delisted their shares.", "This response, led by the market, paved the way for the passage of Glass-Steagall in 1933.", "As Fuller (2009) puts it: \"Divorce made a virtue of necessity and cursed and condemned bankers jumped at the opportunity to demonstrate their virtue\".", "The market was leading where regulators had feared to tread.", "Today, the situation is not so dissimilar.", "As then, many of the world's global banks have fallen from heady heights to trade at heavy discounts to the book value of their assets.", "If anything, the discounts to book value are even greater today than in the early 1930s (Chart 20).", "As then, this conjunction is stirring market pressures to separate.", "Bankers today, many cursed and condemned, could make a virtue of necessity.", "The market could lead where regulators have feared to tread.", "Modern finance is complex, perhaps too complex.", "Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex.", "As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with complexity.", "Because complexity generates uncertainty, not risk, it requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not complexity.", "Delivering that would require an about-turn from the regulatory community from the path followed for the better part of the past 50 years.", "If a once-in-a-lifetime
