including, credit risk management, funding debt portfolios playing the yield curve and covering short positions and settlement failures.", "Repos are a versatile instrument for a broad range of market participants with very different business models due to their hybrid nature; serving between a collateralized loan and a full transfer of ownership.", "Core structure and content These guidelines have been developed in consultation with key market stakeholders in the financial sector namely: Ghana Fixed Income Market (GFIM), Central Securities Depository (CSD), with technical support from International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and Frontclear.", "Our guidelines are set up to enforce the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) and define with respect to applicable law all relevant aspects of repos traded in Ghana.", "Key changes set out in these guidelines include; the absolute transfer of the title, rights, interest and benefits of any security used as collateral, the expansion of eligible instruments that can be used as collateral and the requirement for margin maintenance.", "Market implementation including targeted training together with Frontclear The implementation of the guidelines will require training for stakeholders.", "The Bank of Ghana together with Frontclear will be organizing a series of training programs starting from next week for all major players in the repo market.", "These training programs will cover legal requirements for the judiciary and legal fraternity, as well as accounting, settlement, margining and collateral management for middle and back office of our financial institutions.", "Market development expectations The adoption of these guidelines I believe will not only ensure legal certainty and enforceability but will also improve market transparency, liquidity and participation.", "In conjunction with the development of the guidelines, Ghana is in the process of getting a corporate insolvency bill passed, and the BoG will issue a notice to clarify the eligibility of netting arrangements under the current Banks and Specialized Deposit Taking Institutions Act (BSDTI Act).", "This will make Ghana only the third netting positive jurisdiction in Africa and we look forward to the positive effect this will have on our economy.", "Looking ahead we hope to develop our Repo market to grow beyond the borders of Ghana to improve intra African trade.", "It is my firm belief we would one day be here again for another launch but this time for whole of the African continent.", "Learning and challenges ahead As with any new journey it will come with its own challenges but with the lessons learned from developed markets we hope to surmount any challenge.", "To my fellow African Governors, I encourage you to share with us for those who have more developed repo markets and to those who are now starting, let's come together and work to make the African financial markets the next destination of global investors.", "To our partners, your technical assistance is invaluable.", "We will continue to rely on your support to build capacity and achieve similar milestones in our markets.", "In conclusion I will like to say a thank you for honouring our invitations.", "I would also like to encourage all of us to use this platform to engage with each other to discover what mutual opportunities there are to share."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Repos", "Ghana", "Financial Markets", "Central Bank", "GMRA", "Monetary Policy", "Market Liquidity", "Netting", "Insolvency", "African Trade"]}
