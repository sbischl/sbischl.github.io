has over a number of years focused on anchoring inflation expectations around the target of close to 2.5 per cent over time and given weight to predictability, with a recognizable response pattern.", "The downturn has not affected long-term inflation expectations to any great extent.", "According to an expectations survey, inflation expectations five years ahead among experts in the financial industry, the social partners and academia were virtually unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009.", "An indicator of inflation expectations in financial markets can be derived from the long-term forward rate differential between Norway and the euro area.", "Because of a higher inflation target in our country, this differential will normally be around 1\u20442-1 percentage point, depending on risk premiums in the bond market.", "The differential has been in this range in recent years, but has fluctuated somewhat since last autumn.", "After a prolonged upturn

revenue spending is expected to be brought back into line with the fiscal rule when cyclical conditions eventually normalise.", "We assume that prospects for higher unemployment, a fall in house prices and a high level of debt will induce households to build up financial buffers and reduce debt.", "The saving ratio is expected to increase considerably.", "Net lending is projected to be positive this year after being negative since 2004.", "As household borrowing has been considerable in recent years, deleveraging in the household sector is important to long-term stability in the economy.", "The outlook ahead, and monetary policy assessments In Norway, inflation will be curbed by lower capacity utilisation.", "The marked increase in unemployment now envisaged will result in lower pay increases this year and next.", "Prospects of weaker growth and lower inflation imply a lower interest rate than presented in the interest rate projection from our last forecast in December.", "There is also a risk that the global downturn will be deeper and more prolonged than expected.", "If this proves to be the case, growth in the Norwegian economy will not pick up as quickly and inflation will fall more sharply than we currently assume.", "The objective of avoiding a pronounced downturn indicates in isolation that the interest rate should be rapidly reduced to a low level.", "On the other hand, we have already made substantial reductions in the key policy rate.", "With a low interest rate, households may save less and the turnaround may occur more rapidly than we assume.", "This indicates in isolation that changes in the interest rate should be gradual or that further interest rate cuts should be put on hold.", "Overall, the outlook and balance of risks suggest that the key policy rate should be gradually reduced further to a level of around 1 per cent in the second half of 2009.", "This is about one percentage point lower than in Norges Bank's forecast from 17 December last year.", "With the low interest rate added to the government fiscal measures, our analysis indicates that growth in the economy will be positive from the second half of this year.", "Growth will be driven by a rise in private consumption as a result of a low key policy rate, growth in real wages and higher government transfers.", "Activity in the economy will be underpinned by strong growth in government spending.", "The projections are based on the assumption that Norges Bank's interest rate changes will translate into lower lending rates for households and businesses.", "At the same time, tighter credit standards in banks are making monetary policy somewhat less effective than normal.", "Inflation is projected to fall below 2 per cent in 2010, before gradually moving up towards the target towards the end of the projection period as the output gap gradually closes.", "There is a risk that the structural changes brought about by the crisis may result in persistently lower productivity growth.", "It appears that inflation will remain considerably lower in the years ahead than we expected in December.", "Both the objective of stabilising inflation around the target and the objective of ensuring stable developments in the real economy suggest that the interest rate should be low.", "Interest rate setting can also be assessed using simple monetary policy rules that prescribe an interest rate path based on actual inflation and output.", "The calculations are based on projections for inflation and output in the current Monetary Policy Report.", "The different rules yield somewhat divergent results, but all of them indicate a decline in the interest rate.", "Rules do not capture possible restrictions in the supply of credit that may affect the monetary policy transmission mechanism.", "Norges Bank has estimated a simple interest rate rule based on the Bank's previous interest rate setting.", "The rule includes developments in inflation, wage growth, mainland GDP and central bank key rates abroad.", "The interest rate in the previous period is also important.", "The key rate is now below the lower end of the interval projected.", "Norges Bank has given weight to staving off particularly adverse outcomes and therefore brought forward the decrease in the key policy rate last autumn.", "The projections for the key rate, inflation, output and other variables are based on our assessment of the economic situation and our perception of the functioning of the economy and monetary policy.", "If economic developments are broadly in line with our projections, economic agents can expect that the interest rate path will also be approximately in line with that projected.", "On the other hand, the interest rate path may shift if the economic prospects change, or if the effect of interest rate changes on inflation, output and employment differs from that assumed.", "In the Monetary Policy Report, we present two alternative scenarios where demand is higher or lower than presented in the baseline scenario.", "The yellow lines in the chart illustrate a scenario where growth in private consumption is stronger than expected and the turnaround occurs more rapidly.", "In this scenario, interest rates may decrease to a lesser extent and move up more quickly.", "The red lines in the chart illustrate a scenario where the global downturn is deeper and more prolonged, with more pronounced effects than assumed.", "It will then be appropriate to set a lower interest rate in order to stimulate the economy and thereby prevent inflation from becoming too low.", "The primary effect of a key rate close to zero will probably come via a weaker krone.", "It will then be appropriate to consider instruments other than the interest rate.", "Monetary policy normally operates by lowering key rates to reduce the real interest rate when expected inflation and market risk premiums are stable in the short term.", "When the key rate moves close to its lower bound, the real interest rate can still be influenced through key rate expectations, influencing risk premiums and anchoring inflation expectations.", "The expectations channel will be particularly important if the current key rate cannot be further reduced.", "For Norges Bank, the expectations channel is an established part of monetary policy in that we provide forecasts for the key policy rate.", "To sum up, it is useful to decompose the factors behind the change in the interest rate path since 17 December 2008.", "The interest rate forecast in the Monetary Policy Report is lower than the forecast published in December last year.", "The outlook for global growth has deteriorated further.", "The slowdown in the Norwegian economy appears to be more pronounced than expected in December.", "Lower global and domestic demand would suggest a lower key policy rate than projected in December.", "Our inflation forecast, along with the stronger krone and lower key rate expectations abroad also suggests a lower key policy rate than projected at that time.", "Monetary policy cannot fine-tune developments in the economy, but it can mitigate the largest effects when the economy is exposed to shocks.", "Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks suggest that the key rate should be gradually reduced further.", "The key policy rate should be in the interval 1-2 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 17 June 2009, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination",
