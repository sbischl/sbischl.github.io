addressed the problem set out by Mervyn King in the wake of the global financial crisis.", "Can authorities now resolve complex international banks without recourse to public funds, while maintaining

in death.", "We think that we are getting closer to a solution to the problem framed by Mervyn King.", "We have an internationally coordinated response grounded in national law.", "By pre-positioning
