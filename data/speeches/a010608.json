electricity and petrol prices and adjusting for changes in indirect taxes, price inflation was approximately 21\u20442 per cent, which is in line with the current inflation target.", "It should be pointed out, however, that our adjustment of the figures may overestimate these effects.", "We assume, for example, that increases in indirect taxes are passed on in their entirety to the consumer.",

electricity prices are not only the result of last year's low precipitation levels in Western Norway and higher electricity taxes.", "Other, more permanent conditions may also have contributed.", "The increase in petrol prices leads to higher prices on other goods such as transport services and we have not adjusted for this.", "However, adjusting inflation figures for direct effects of one-off

direct impact on the consumer price index.", "The Bank of England aims at an inflation target that is adjusted for such effects.", "In New Zealand, the inflation target is formulated as growth in the consumer price index, but the mandate specifies factors for which adjustments may be made.", "These factors include price changes due to substantial changes in commodity prices, changes in indirect taxes, considerable changes in economic policy which directly impact prices, as well as natural disasters.", "There are no continuous, fixed indicators that make adjustments for these factors, but adjustments are made if the effects are substantial.", "In Sweden and Canada, the inflation target is formulated as growth in the consumer price index without special exclusions.", "However, in practice, indices for underlying inflation are used in the implementation and assessment of monetary policy.", "Sweden's Riksbank often refers to an indicator that adjusts for the direct effects of interest rates and net indirect taxes.", "The Bank of Canada has now defined a new indicator as the operational target of monetary policy.", "This indicator is the consumer price index excluding the eight most volatile components: fruit, vegetables, petrol, heating oil, natural gas, domestic air travel, tobacco products and interest rate costs.", "Adjustments are also made for the effect of indirect taxes.", "The consumer price index is compiled to show developments in the cost of living.", "To some degree, the consumer price index overestimates developments in the cost of living.", "This is partly related to the fact that the measurement method does not adequately capture quality changes in the service industry.", "The Boskin Report (1996) discovered that the US CPI overestimated the actual cost of living increase by 0.8-1.6 percentage points annually.", "Statistics Norway has assessed the measurement error in the Norwegian consumer price index.", "The conclusion is that the Norwegian index also overestimates developments in the cost of living but that the deviation is probably well below one percentage point annually.", "National consumer price indices are constructed in various ways.", "For example, there are differences in the goods and services included, the relative weights assigned to the goods and services included and the frequency with which the weights are adjusted.", "In addition, the method of weighting the various sub-indices - ie whether the arithmetic or geometric average is used - may also affect the growth rate.", "Eurostat's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) represents a standard that facilitates the comparison of countries.", "The national index in the UK is calculated by using arithmetic averages, whereas geometric averages are used in the harmonised index.", "Several items in the national index are not included in the harmonised index, for example costs related to housing (house depreciation, council tax and building insurance).", "In contrast, air fares, university accommodation fees, foreign students' university tuition fees and payments by residents of nursing and retirement homes are excluded from the national index but included in the harmonised index.", "Year-on-year growth figures in April showed a difference of nearly one percentage point between the Bank of England's index (RIPX) and the HICP.", "This index tied to the inflation target showed 2 per cent growth in the last 12 months, whereas the harmonised index showed an increase of 1.1 percentage point.", "Different treatment of housing costs pushed the national index up by more than 1\u20442 percentage point compared with the harmonised index.", "Different weighting methods accounted for a similar proportion of the increase.", "Different weights reduced growth in the national index by nearly 1\u20444 percentage point compared with the harmonised index.", "Predictability, transparency and communication Central banks control the volume of central bank liquidity or the interest rate on this liquidity.", "Most central banks use the interest rate on intra-day liquidity.", "In Norway, this is the interest rate

debt amounts to roughly NOK 1500 billion, whereas the total money supply is approximately NOK 750 billion.", "Our key rate has a direct influence on a very small portion of the total money and credit market.", "Monetary policy would not affect price inflation if our key rate only influenced the interest rate on the amount outstanding between the central bank and the banks.", "We are dependent on a spillover effect on interest rates on debt in the household and enterprise sectors.", "The link between these variables and the key rate runs through market expectations and the yield curve.", "Long-term interest rates that are determined by the market reflect expected future short-term rates, uncertainty and risk premiums.", "Interest rates on money market investments with maturities of more than one day will be influenced by expectations about changes in Norges Bank's rates in the future.", "Interest on investments that mature in one week will be a weighted average of expected interest on one-day investments in the days up to maturity.", "Similarly, three-month rates reflect both prevailing and expected future overnight rates.", "If economic agents believe that Norges Bank will reduce interest rates in the next few weeks, three-month-rates will be lower than interest on kronedenominated assets with shorter maturities.", "Similarly, if economic agents believe that Norges Bank will raise interest rates in the next few weeks, three-month-rates will be higher than rates on kronedenominated assets with shorter maturities.", "If there is confidence in monetary policy, changes in Norges Bank's rates will have little effect on longterm interest rates.", "These rates will then primarily be determined by the demand for real return on capital that originates in the international capital market.", "If confidence in economic policy deteriorates, for example because Norges Bank sets interest rates so low that inflation and unstable exchange rates are expected, long-term interest rates will rise.", "The cost of low confidence is thus high risk premiums and unnecessarily high long-term interest rates.", "Transparency in our intentions, strategies and implementation of monetary policy may contribute to reducing uncertainty among economic agents.", "If monetary policy is predictable, an important source of risk is diminished.", "Thus, all else being equal, the interest rate that is necessary to achieve the inflation target will be lower.", "There will then be a better chance of achieving the inflation target without frequent and abrupt changes in the key rate.", "Predictability may contribute to ensuring more stable developments in demand and output.", "Thus, a predictable monetary policy may contribute to improving the efficiency and impact of monetary policy.", "Predictability and transparency are often equated.", "However, increased transparency does not necessarily imply a higher degree of predictability.", "Many cite the Bank of England as a very transparent central bank, because it presents its assessments of the economic outlook in its inflation reports and publishes the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings.", "A report6 prepared by Dr. Sushil Wadhwani, a member of the MPC, indicates, however, that the Bank of England's interest rate changes in the period 3 June 1997 -18 April 2001 have come as more of a surprise to market participants than interest rate changes in continental Europe and the US during the same period.", "The same study indicates that the element of surprise has waned over time.", "In

central bank's decisions, to see each of them as the logical conclusion of a chain of past and future decisions aimed at a clear set of targets,...\") This view of transparency and predictability contrasts sharply with the earlier practice of playing on the element of surprise.", "In monetary policy, this was associated especially with control of the exchange rate.", "Gradually, the economic policy met distrust and high premiums for uncertainty.", "The effects of changes in monetary policy instruments became increasingly uncertain.", "Nevertheless, a desire for predictability must not precede the demand for an interest rate setting that the central bank deems to be correct.", "The expectations of other economic agents must not control the setting of interest rates.", "There are a number of examples from countries with \"transparent\" monetary policies where interest rate changes have come as a surprise.", "This may be partly due to the fact that the central bank had a

interest rate scenario the basis for inflation projections.", "Their argument is as follows: If the central bank itself does not regard an unchanged interest rate during the forecast period as the most probable scenario, the price inflation projection will not be the most probable one either.", "Thus, the projection does not provide guidance as to what inflation the central bank actually expects.", "In Norges Bank, we have used both an unchanged interest rate and an interest rate scenario based on market expectations in our inflation reports.", "If Norges Bank projects price inflation
