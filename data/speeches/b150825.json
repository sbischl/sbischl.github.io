encourage wider participation, Reserve Bank has allowed CCIL to introduce anonymous electronic trading platform.", "To address counterparty credit risk, Reserve Bank has also permitted CCIL to provide

facility has many benefits like availability of transparent quotes, less documentation requirement, reduced credit risk, saving of capital, higher credit exposure etc.", "I will urge banks to actively use the interest rate derivative products like IRS and IRF to manage interest rate risk in their portfolio so that the need for seeking regulatory relief during periods of stress could be avoided.", "When we come to Interest Rate Futures, unlike IRS, the experience was not encouraging till the launch of single bond cash settled IRF in January 2014.", "The earlier avatars of IRFs contracts did not attract enough market interest mainly due to illiquid securities in the underlying basket leading to fear of receiving illiquid securities in delivery based settlement and complex theoretical calculations for cash settled contracts.", "Taking into account the feedback of the market participants, it was decided to introduce cash settled single bond IRF on underlying security with residual maturity between 9-10 years.", "The 10 year single bond IRF has received good response from the market as the product is simple to understand and is cash settled.", "In view of success of cash settled

improve liquidity in the corporate bond market and provide an alternate source of funding, repo in corporate debt was introduced in January 2010.", "Since then, the guidelines have been relaxed in

market.", "Credit default swaps 18.", "In order to provide an avenue for participants to mitigate credit risk and enable effective redistribution of credit risk within the system, the Reserve Bank introduced CDS in the Indian market in December 2011.", "The guidelines on CDS were framed after extensive market consultations.", "However, there was hardly any market interest in the product.", "Subsequently changes were made in the guidelines, such as, increasing the scope of reference/deliverable obligations by permitting CDS on unlisted but rated bonds even for issues other than infrastructure companies andpermitting CDS on securities with original maturity up to one year like CP, CD and NCDs as reference / deliverable obligations.", "But investor interest is still elusive.", "Major reason cited for the lack of trading interest in CDS is restriction on netting of Mark to market (MTM) position for capital adequacy and exposure norms.", "The Reserve Bank's extant instructions on computation of exposure arising out of OTC derivative contracts do not permit bilateral netting of exposures due to uncertainty on legal enforceability of close-out netting in the event of liquidation of statutory corporations.", "To my mind, the issue needs to be addressed through legislative changes in one of the two possible ways: by amending Acts/Statutes that govern statutory corporations and state owned/nationalised banks, wherever applicable.", "Amendments to a large number of enactments, particularly in a synchronised manner, may be, however, practically difficult.", "Accordingly, as an alternative, a single, harmonized and uniform legislation for close-out netting with overriding powers on all other Acts/Statutes applicable to all types of banks and other entities may be enacted.", "This will provide transparency, comprehensiveness and clarity and provide ease of regulation and supervision to the Reserve Bank.", "The legislation can be a standalone law or can form part of existing laws - The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or the Payment & Settlement Systems Act, 2007.Pending legislative changes, feasible options could be explored

higher shorting limits for such securities to facilitate PDs to provide two way quotes.", "Review of guidelines on LAF accounting 33.", "The revised accounting guidelines for market repo transactions in government securities and corporate debt securities were issued in March 23, 2010.", "These guidelines recognised the economic essence of a repo transaction as a collateralized lending and borrowing transaction, with an agreement to repurchase, on the agreed terms.", "These were, however, not to apply to repo / reverse repo transactions conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) with RBI.", "We are in the process of converging the LAF accounting norms as well to the market repo norms.", "In line with market repo guidelines, securities acquired by entities under LAF

issued draft guidelines for public feedback on issuance of Rupee bonds overseas.", "Several comments have been received and the final guidelines are expected to be issued shortly covering a comprehensive review of the ECB guidelines.", "It is recognised that while the issuance of Rupee bonds will broadly be under the ECB norms, a differential set of criteria would be required for such issuances.", "The objective would be to prescribe a simpler regime addressing many of the issues raised by the respondents.", "Given the fact that the currency risk would be borne by the investors, from an external debt perspective, raising of funds through the Rupee bond issuance should sit a tad higher in the hierarchy of preferences under the overall external debt framework.", "OTC market reforms - cross border issues 37.", "The ongoing international efforts towards strengthening OTC markets are taking place at two levels: \u2022 Global standard setters' overarching frameworks and principles ensure that changes are implemented in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way; \u2022 National authorities putting in place the appropriate legislation and regulations

country-specific requirements, may have unintended consequences for the development of markets.", "I would like to highlight the challenges being faced in us in three Central counter-parties 39.", "The approach being adopted in major international jurisdictions with regard to CCP requirements have raised concerns over possibilities of extra territorial regulatory jurisdiction leading to regulatory conflict and disruptions for market activity.", "For instance, European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) as modified by the Dodd-Frank Act contain prescriptive rules that may prevent European/US banks from participating in third-country clearing houses that have not applied for recognition by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) or that are not registered as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) as per CFTC regulations.", "While the discussions are still on, the uncertainty over the inconsistencies between EU and US rules, the process and timeline for equivalence assessments may affect the trust in the functioning of international financial markets and may have impact on progress of implementation of G-20 reform agenda.", "As per FSB commitments, jurisdictions should remove barriers to trade reporting by market participants, with particular attention to removing barriers to reporting of counterparty information and to information access by authorities.", "However, a distinction may need to be made between barriers to reporting to a domestic TR and reporting to foreign TR.", "As long as the one leg of the transaction is being reported to any one recognised TR in any jurisdiction, no other sharing requirement may be needed at the individual entity level.", "Efforts should be made to make the global TRs talk to each other, which could be greatly facilitated after full implementation of the LEI regime.", "Such measures would also reduce cost of compliance for the market participants without compromising on regulatory effectiveness.", "The Payment & Settlement Systems Act in India (under which the TR is now governed) has enabled RBI to disclose such document / information to any person, if it considers necessary in protecting the larger public interest.", "At the entity level, sharing of client/counterparty data with third party, which includes a non-domestic TR, is governed by the contractual relationship and being done after obtaining customer consent.", "Entities are expected to keep into consideration the provisions under the various statutes, rules and case laws dealing with bankers' duty of confidentiality of customer information and the secrecy obligations.", "The European Commission has released a proposed regulation \"on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts\".", "\"Users\" of benchmarks which are EU supervised entities may not use benchmarks provided by non-EU benchmark administrators from jurisdictions which do not satisfy an equivalence requirement.", "There is an urgent need for all jurisdictions to agree to a set of harmonized equivalence criteria to avoid any unintended consequences.", "My limited objective behind sketching a broad canvas of our past and ongoing efforts was to bring home the point that development of financial markets is a complex web of various underlying factors and processes which need to synergistically come together.", "While it definitely cannot happen by a regulatory fiat, regulatory nudges are indeed necessary.", "It is an incremental process based on adaptive learning.", "While central banks, as extended financial regulators, have been enjoined upon greater responsibilities in the postcrisis context, they have also been at the center of criticism for not getting the balance right.", "This is a judgement issue and policy makers are expected to carry out this responsibility within a broad set of principles and an understanding shaped by various adaptive learning processes.", "It is difficult to codify this into a set of simple rules/laws.", "The draft Indian Financial Code (IFC), though an ambitious attempt in this direction, leaves large gaps unaddressed.", "Any exercise to reshape the legislative architecture of the financial sector should evolve organically, starting with an objective reassessment of where the current system has failed.", "In this regard it is pertinent to note the observation of Joseph J. Norton, that \"each country situation is sui-generis, with the best, informed decision dependent on and taking regard of local historical, social, economic, financial market, regulatory and political factors and conditions.", "\"2 This is particularly important when there are many open ended policy issues which are being debated internationally.", "Post-crisis, there has been a comprehensive reassessment internationally of the approaches to financial regulation marked by clear shift in preferred models.", "The realignment in UK with the prudential regulation coming back to the Bank of England was the strongest statement against the pre-crisis regulatory philosophy which lies at the core of some of the current proposals.", "We are fortunately not faced with severe system failures, the key trigger for other countries to overhaul their frameworks.", "There is therefore no reason for a hasty, radical revamping.", "It must be kept in mind that from a public policy perspective the
