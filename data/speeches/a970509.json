the repo rate - in 1996.", "\u2022 What used to be an almost chronic deficit on current account has now been turned into a substantial surplus.", "This is reducing Sweden's external debt, which also contributes to greater financial stability.", "\u2022 Many structural measures have been implemented since the late 1980s.", "There are signs that, together with economic policy's focus on stability, this has reduced the economy's inflation propensity and raised potential output.", "Against this background, the direction of Sweden's economic policy contrasts sharply with the unstable, inflationary path we experienced in the 1970s and '80s and which contributed to the recession in the early '90s, which was the worst for over sixty years.", "A new direction in economic policy The 1970s and '80s illustrate how a period of inflation creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and instability, with a speculative climate and \"short-termism\" in economic decisions.", "Slowly but surely, production's long-term conditions deteriorate.", "It was partly in the light of such experiences that Swedish economic policy was realigned at the turn of the 1980s.", "Since then, the focus on price stability has gained broad support in our society, including the political parties.", "However, in view of the severe economic problems in the early 1990s, with inflation expectations based on our historical record and a massive budget deficit, it took time for the new direction of economic policy to acquire credibility.", "This has been evident, for instance, in the periods of interest and exchange rate unrest.", "Financial market trends particularly in the longer run can be regarded as an indicator of the prevailing degree of confidence in the determination and ability to conduct an economic policy that is consistent and oriented towards stability.", "With the free movement of capital and the globalisation of financial markets, economic policy decision-makers need to be highly disciplined.", "In the light of our experience since the policy realignment at the turn of the '80s, this is a fact that is widely recognised today in Sweden.", "Turning the clock back would not be feasible.", "Experience from other countries, where the policy realignment had already been made in the early 1980s, indicates that the creation of confidence in a low inflation regime takes time and a lot of hard work.", "But it also shows that after a while, such a process does yield its reward in the form of low interest rates, a stable currency and ultimately a favourable economic development.", "The price stability target Following the move to a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy in Sweden is directed at a quantified inflation target.", "In this it resembles the situation for monetary policy in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where inflation targets are also used.", "In Sweden the target is formulated as being to limit the increase in the consumer price index to 2 per cent.", "This target is to be assessed, not in terms of isolated twelve-month change figures but in a somewhat longer, annual, perspective.", "As monetary policy obviously cannot control price developments exactly, the target is accompanied by a tolerance interval of \u00b11 percentage point.", "This tolerance interval also serves to absorb temporary deviations from trend inflation.", "Such deviations may arise, for instance, from political decisions to alter indirect taxes and subsidies, changes in interest rates as well as from international price shocks.", "For March 1997 the consumer price index showed a twelve-month fall of 0.4 per cent.", "However, this figure was to a large extent influenced by last year's sharp repo rate cuts.", "When home owners renew mortgage loans at lower interest rates we get a transitory downward effect on inflation.", "It is important to distinguish between CPI changes and underlying inflation.", "Transitory effects, for example changes in interest rates or in indirect taxes and subsidies, may cause the general price level to jump up and down.", "In the conduct of monetary policy it is therefore important to keep an eye on underlying inflation; the transitory effects are of secondary significance as long as they do not affect inflation expectations and thereby trend inflation.", "Given the time lag that applies to monetary policy, a central bank that targets inflation has to monitor the various factors which determine inflation one to two years ahead.", "In a simple analysis of inflation's determinants one can start from the familiar augmented Phillips curve.", "The rate of inflation is determined by two factors: the relationship between supply and demand in the economy - the output gap - and inflation's expected rate.", "Note, however, that while the output gap is a useful starting point for an inflation analysis, there is no simple way of measuring it.", "This makes it necessary to go into more detail and study a variety of indicators in order to analyse any tensions between demand and supply.", "Still, the output gap is a suitable starting point for my present purpose.", "The simple model tells us that when the output gap is closed, inflation is constant and equal to the expected rate.", "This means that, with normal capacity utilisation and given a low level of inflation expectations, actual GDP can follow potential output.", "In such a situation some form of external shock is needed to shift inflation upwards or downwards.", "This can mean either that production falls below or rises above the level for normal capacity utilisation or that inflation expectations move up or down.", "The latter case is ultimately a matter of confidence in economic policy's consistency and its future reactions.", "The ability of monetary policy to influence inflation has to do with the impact of the instrumental rate on the path of GDP and thereby on the degree of capacity utilisation, together with its effect on inflation expectations.", "In practice a period of restricted demand has frequently been necessary for the central bank to show that expectations of high inflation are unfounded.", "Besides monetary policy, expectations are affected by other factors.", "One of these is the budget.", "Unsustainably large budget deficits are liable to undermine confidence in long-term price stability.", "Our inflation forecast serves as a foundation for decisions about monetary conditions.", "If monetary policy is directed at stabilising inflation at 2 per cent, it will over time help to stabilise demand so that this is in line with the economy's available capacity.", "In order to clarify our line of reasoning and our inflation assessments, the Riksbank publishes an inflation report four times a year.", "A range of indicators is reviewed in these reports, accompanied by a discussion of risks and opportunities in the field of inflation.", "The present situation In the latest inflation report, published this March, GDP growth in 1997 and 1998 was expected to be around 2 and 3 per cent, respectively.", "It was also argued that sizeable capacity restrictions should not arise in the course of the period.", "Given that, and inflation expectations being low, underlying domestic inflation (measured with the CPI excluding transitory effects on inflation) in the coming two years was put at between 1.5 and 2 per cent.", "As we all know, to forecast inflation is a complicated task.", "In view of the shortcomings in such estimates, it is more a matter of assessing the balance of risks.", "Our latest inflation report therefore includes a discussion of two alternatives in which future inflation might be either lower or higher than in the main scenario.", "One alternative is that inflation could be lower than in the main scenario, mainly if private consumption were to be weak.", "The other envisages the opposite -
