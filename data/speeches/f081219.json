inductivism or deductivism.", "The inductive approach requires the mechanic to look for evidence in the real world and come to conclusions.", "For instance, if we see crows that are black and if we continue to see black crows, we may conclude that all crows are black.", "A motorcycle mechanic may likewise see the faulty part and conclude that the fault lies in that part.", "The deductive approach, on the other hand, requires the mechanic to theorise in his mind and come to conclusions based on empirical findings he would make to support his theory.", "In the previous black crow

follows the scientific method in the diagnosis of the fault and the subsequent repair of the motorcycle.", "It involves starting with an open mind.", "There are no previously made conclusions or prejudgments.", "The approach is simply classical, that is, guided by underlying principles and not by the immediate appearance.", "There are several steps which a scientist should follow when he adopts the scientific method.", "A good motorcycle mechanic would also follow the same steps.", "The steps involved in a scientific inquiry are as follows.", "First, the identified problem has to be stated in clear terms.", "In the case of a motorcycle, the problem may be that the engine does not start.", "Second, based on the problem, one hypothesis or several hypotheses as required regarding

there is fuel in the tank, then he would examine the second hypothesis, that is, whether there is a blockage in the tube that distributes fuel to the engine.", "If there is a blockage, he will clean it and try to start the engine.", "If there is no blockage, then he would experiment the third hypothesis, namely, the working of the electrical system.", "In this manner, he would experiment all the hypotheses he has made one by one and make relevant conclusions.", "Fourth, the results of the experiments are analysed in order to ascertain whether the hypothesis is proved.", "Or else, when several hypotheses have been made, to ascertain which hypothesis has been proved.", "Fifth, making final conclusions out of the observed results of the experiments.", "A disciplined motorcycle mechanic would follow these steps involved in the scientific method and attend to the required repair of the fault in the motorcycle.", "In this sense, a sideway motorcycle mechanic is not different from a trained scientist, since both follow the scientific method in reaching conclusions.", "The use of techniques and technology It has been fashionable for scientists to make use of scientific techniques and technology to facilitate the decision making process, when undertaking scientific inquiries.", "Extreme care should be exercised by scientists in this instance.", "Every technique has its own methodology and limitations and the scientist should be fully aware of same when such techniques are used.", "Inappropriate use of the techniques or wrong conclusions made on the basis of the results derived amount to misuse of science by the researchers.", "It also paves way for crafty individuals to use the results to their advantage and gullible individuals to get victimised.", "The use of econometrics has been one of the techniques employed by scientists to prove or disprove their hypotheses.", "This has also been one of the sources of misuse of science, either because wrong calculations are made or wrong conclusions are arrived at, due to the failure of the researcher to analyse the error term appropriately.", "Wikipedia, the cyberencyclopaedia, is full of the instances of such misuse of econometric methods in research.", "It is noteworthy to refer to two studies done by Deirdre N McCloskey and Stephen T Ziliak of the University of Iowa on the status of econometric studies in research articles published in the reputed journal American Economic Review in 1980s.", "They have found fault with authors for not analysing the error term properly and using the statistical term \"significance\" inappropriately.", "One of their papers published in the in Journal of Economic Literature March, 1996 under the title \"The Standard Error of Regressions\" has made the following eyeopening comment: \"Such misuses of statistical significance appear to depend in part on a vintage effect, measured by date of Ph.D. conferral.", "The papers authored by Ph.D.s conferred between 1975 and 1979, when inexpensively generated t-tests first reached the masses, were considerably worse than the papers of others at making a distinction between economic and statistical significance.", "They used the word \"significance\" in ambiguous ways more often than did early or later Ph.D.s and they were less likely to separate statistical significance from other types of significance in the sections on scientific and policy implications\" (p 111).", "The other findings of McCloskey and Ziliak are also startling.", "Of the 182 articles in the American Economic Review they have surveyed, 70 percent had not distinguished statistical significance from economic, policy or scientific significance.", "While they had referred to largeness of the estimators, 72 percent had not asked \"how large was large?\"", "At the same time, 59 percent had used the word \"significance\" in ambiguous ways.", "A more pronounced failure has been the non-reporting of descriptive statistics such as the means of the regression variables by 69 percent of the authors.", "The problem with econometric studies is that the computations made by authors remain as a \"black box\" to ordinary readers.", "It is the responsibility of the editors of journals to verify the black box and assure quality on behalf the general public who consumes the outcome of research studies.", "It is, therefore, disheartening that learned journals have published such papers without due reference and consideration of the methodology adopted in conducting the research under reference.", "Today, of course, with advanced statistical packages available, it is possible for the editors of the journals to check on the appropriateness of the statistical calculations made by the paper writers.", "Since the ordinary readers of scientific papers are unable to gauge the wrongful way of handling econometrics by researchers, such studies by editors before papers are published become all the more important.", "In view of the gullibility of general readers, the misuse of econometrics in learned papers is akin to \"misselling\" that one finds in the market place when a seller has not fully apprised a buyer of the risks of buying a product.", "This type of mis-selling by researchers could be termed \"econometric dishonesty\" which they are not supposed to practise.", "Researchers find a truth and not the truth The real world is vast and complex.", "Hence, it cannot be mapped out by scientific research adequately, just like neurologists are unable to map out the human brain completely.", "What the science does is to discover only a flint of the truth in the vast real world.", "As such, there is no dearth of hypotheses which scientists could make and a dearth of theories which they can formulate.", "That is good news for prospective scientists.", "However, one theory which is valid today could be disproved by another theory to be formulated tomorrow.", "Hence, all theories are subject to the same property: the property of refutability.", "In fact, Karl Popper's argument was that if a theory cannot be refuted, then it does not become a theory.", "Hence, any scientific research will discover only a truth and not the truth.", "This means that all scientific research studies undertaken in all the disciplines would produce only a relative truth and not the absolute truth.", "With all the scientific apparatuses, techniques and computing capacity available today, science still cannot reach out to the absolute truth.", "As such, the task of finding the absolute truth has been relegated to religion and mystics.", "This may be discouraging news for those who are engaged in scientific research.", "But, that has been the way of science throughout its history and such discovery of relative truth has been adequate for the purpose of building the human knowledge base and putting it to practical use by mankind.", "In the modern world, the discovery of absolute truth may therefore be irrelevant.", "A researcher is not a propagandist or a dictator.", "His task is to follow an accepted set of principles, guidelines and an ethical and moral code to discover a truth, and not the truth, and add it to the extant knowledge base.", "He should start his inquiry with an open mind and be ready to reject even the long held views if empirical studies do not support them.", "But to do so, a researcher should display a fair degree of maturity and necessarily cultivate within himself self-discipline, wisdom, objectivity and equanimity.", "In this sense, a perfect researcher is like the Buddha who is not guided by biased or prejudiced emotions.", "Hence, the most important requirement of a researcher is that he should be
