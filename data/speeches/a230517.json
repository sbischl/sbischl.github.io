Credit market developments very well combine our two main objectives - price and financial stability.", "The current data from money flow monitoring are as follows: The volume of new mortgages dropped

this channel is also gradually cooling as the ECB raises its rates.", "In Q1, the volume of new euro loans to firms fell by 6% year on year.", "The decline in demand in the economy is documented by the following: Household consumption, which is crucial for the future course of demand-pull inflation, fell for the sixth consecutive quarter.", "The saving rate is now 21.7%, while the long-term average is 12%.", "The decline in demand is also illustrated by the fact that prices of new apartments are already falling quarter on quarter.", "This is accompanied by the fact that the economy is below potential output and we have a negative output gap.", "I would like to mention two important problems: (1) the CNB's large balance sheet and (2) government debt.", "Regarding the CNB's large balance sheet, over the last ten years, interest rates were too low, in fact zero for a long time.", "In addition, in early 2017, interventions led to an increase in the CNB's balance sheet within four months, or rather in the banking sector's liquidity.", "there was an additional CZK 1,000 billion in the balance sheet, or an almost doubling of the balance sheet within four months of 2017.", "During these interventions, demand for Czech government bonds from non-residents increased.", "This further expanded the country's borrowing options.", "Then, during Covid, in particular at the end of March 2020, interest rates were reduced too close to zero.", "And fiscal policy was expansive for too long - we created a dangerous entitlement economy in which the state was the rich uncle who helped with almost everything.", "When an economy such as this one (especially one with a huge surplus of money and incomplete price convergence) was hit by a strong supplyside shock after the lockdowns, the Czech Republic ended up with the highest core inflation in the EU (from November 2021 to October 2022).", "We address the causes of inflation in the Czech Republic in our blog article (Adam and Michl, 2022).", "Bullard (2023) also wrote an article on this topic last week.", "The central bank's large balance sheet can lead to changes in monetary policy transmission.", "This is also because when key interest rates are raised, monetary policymaking expenses increase.", "We pay interest to commercial banks for their excess liquidity deposits.", "To give you an idea, the CNB paid CZK 14.7 billion to the banks in interest on deposited liquidity in April 2023, which may amount to CZK 180 billion for 2023 as a whole.", "This can lead to a change in the behaviour of banks, i.e.", "how and to whom they provide loans, by how much they raise deposit rates.", "In a system with excess liquidity, banks easily buy government bonds and government debt is monetised.", "An important lesson for me is that we will try not to repeat 2017 at the CNB and conduct monetary policy in a conventional manner.", "In his article, \"Less is more\" for the IMF's magazine, Professor at the University of Chicago and former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan said: \"Central banks have constrained their own policy space with asymmetric and unconventional policies, ostensibly intended to deal with the policy rate touching the lower bound.", "They have triggered a variety of imbalances that are making fighting inflation harder today.\"", "More purposeful and less interventionist central banks would probably do better than a high-inflation, high-debt, low-growth world (Rajan, 2023).", "For central banks, less can mean more.", "Therefore, our strategy in the Czech Republic is \"higher for longer\", i.e.", "to maintain interest rates at higher levels for longer.", "Regarding government debt, I stated that monetary policy is at its tightest in 20 years and is slowing the economy.", "A problem arises if the government helps the economy with subsidies, supports and contributions at the same time.", "This counters our fight against inflation and the economy is not dampened as much as it should be.", "Therefore, the CNB must consider the following: Should we start competing with the government and dampen the economy by, for example, increasing rates?", "Should we further push down demand, just to have it subsequently fostered by the government with some kind of supports or subsidies?", "And so on ... it is a vicious circle.", "It would be better if both policies were anti-inflationary at the same time.", "Cochrane (2003) describes these considerations, as does the excellent article on the subject presented by Bianchi and Melosi (2022) at the conference in Jackson Hole last year.", "To add to that, everything is complicated further by the first problem described above, i. e. the CNB's large balance sheet, or the huge liquidity of the banking sector.", "I agree with Professors Mandel and Dvoa\u0301k (2022) who stated in their article \"Current global inflation\" that Milton Friedman's view that restrictive monetary policy is not dependent on the support of fiscal policy and can be effective in its own right was formulated for a situation where there was an appropriate amount of bank liquidity.", "In a monetary system with huge excess liquidity and induced high inflation, a reduction in the state budget deficit plays a key role in the fight against inflation and significantly eases the position of the central bank.", "Therefore, defeating inflation in the long term is conditional on coordination between monetary and fiscal policy.", "If fiscal policy records increasing budget deficits, monetary policy will find it very hard to ensure low inflation on its own, in a system with such a huge liquidity surplus and a willingness of banks to buy bonds.", "That is why I said at the press conference after each of our monetary policy meetings that reducing the country's debt is a further key condition for lowering inflation.", "We at the CNB studied with interest the documents for the government coalition's press conference on 11 May called the \"Recovery package\" (Czech Ministry of Finance, 2023a, 2023b).", "We welcome the government's austerity efforts.", "The implementation of the package is in the hands of the government and parliament, not in ours, so I will not comment on the individual steps.", "Generally speaking, it is essential in the fight against inflation that the state budget deficit falls as much as possible compared with the actual outcome of the previous year, not just compared with the plan.", "It would be ideal for the fight against inflation if expenditure declined year on year compared with the actual outcome of the previous year (to dampen demand) and indirect taxes were not increased (to avoid increasing inflation).", "However, that is a political decision and it is not within my competence.", "In any case, we need our tightest monetary policy in twenty years to be accompanied by a credible budget consolidation plan, which the public will trust to support our efforts to reduce inflation.", "Inflation is our responsibility.", "However, we are in this together with the government.", "We need support from fiscal policy.", "Reducing inflation is in the country's interest.", "We have already tamed several money flows in the economy.", "Above all, reducing the country's debt is now needed for a long-lasting return of inflation to low levels.", "Inflace v R:
