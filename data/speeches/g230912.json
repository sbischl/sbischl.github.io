pursuit of revenue, bottom lines and the relentless drive for valuations.", "Sometimes, it is forgotten that the success of any enterprise is intricately tied to the satisfaction and trust of its customers.", "This is the first critical issue I wish to highlight.", "We must remember what Steve Jobs once said, \"you have got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology\"16. .", "To focus on customers means embracing a customer-centric approach to innovation by understanding the needs of customers, making provisions that protect customer interests and earn their trust.", "This calls for developing an organisational culture in which continuous feedback mechanisms are embedded in the business strategy.", "Designing solutions that safely and efficiently meet customer needs would not only elicit trust of customers, it would also meet business objectives in a sustainable manner.", "This can be achieved through simplified user interfaces and quick customer grievance redress mechanisms.", "Avoiding customer harassment is essential to achieving long-term customer trust.", "In this context, I would like to further add that digital innovations, at times, have also led to cyber-risk and data security related issues.", "Illustratively, mushrooming of illegal loan apps, many of which had their origin in foreign jurisdictions, have led to serious concerns about breach of data privacy, unethical business conduct, levying of exorbitant interest rates, and harsh recovery practices.", "This highlights the urgent need to ensure that innovations are accompanied by prudential safeguards and responsible conduct.", "It is also imperative that regulated entities operate within the perimeter set by the licensing conditions and only undertake activities which are permitted under the regulations.", "The second critical aspect is the important role of governance in FinTechs.", "By providing clear governance structures, FinTechs can demonstrate their commitment to transparency, accountability and responsible decision-making.", "In fact, effective governance in FinTechs require a collaborative effort involving regulators, industry associations and the FinTech community itself.", "Regulators play a critical role in addressing arbitrage, ensuring compliance with existing laws, and adapting regulations to technological advancements.", "Industry associations can facilitate development of best practices.", "The most critical role, however, has to be played by FinTechs themselves.", "They must proactively adopt high standards of governance.", "A robust governance structure encompasses clear delineation of roles and responsibilities, transparent decision-making processes, accountability mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement.", "Good governance must focus on ensuing effective oversight, ethical conduct and risk management.", "Ultimately, it is good governance which would be key to durable and long term success of FinTechs.", "The third critical issue I would like to highlight is the need to establish an effective self-regulatory structure by the FinTech players themselves.", "They need to evolve industry best practices, privacy and data protection norms in sync with the laws of the land, set standards to avoid mis-selling, promote ethical business practices, transparency of pricing, etc.", "I would like to use this opportunity to urge and encourage the FinTechs to establish a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) themselves.", "Technological innovation has unprecedented potential to make finance more inclusive, competitive and robust.", "It is crucial that technological advancements in the world of FinTech evolve in a responsible manner and are truly beneficial to the people at large.", "It is, therefore, vital for these innovations to be scalable and interoperable.", "FinTech players should themselves ensure responsible digital innovations.", "The Reserve Bank, on its part, will continue to drive the necessary regulatory and other policy measures to promote a vibrant and responsive FinTech ecosystem.", "The Indian economy is growing rapidly and with it, the demand for financial services.", "The coming years hold immense promise and innovators across the world should explore these opportunities.", "I firmly believe that the GFF will emerge as a key global platform to unlock the full potential of India's FinTech ecosystem.", "My best wishes to you all for the success of this Global Fintech Festival."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
