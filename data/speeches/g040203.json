some information about the central bank's loss function.", "A central bank that places considerable emphasis on inflation and little emphasis on the real economy will choose a short horizon.", "A central bank that places considerable emphasis on the real economy will choose a long horizon.", "Behind the choice of a horizon of normally two years lies a perception of how the interest rate affects developments in inflation and output, and the central bank's trade-off between variations in these two variables.", "According to theories on optimal monetary policy, the horizon should vary and partly depend on the size and duration of disturbances to the economy.", "For some types of disturbances, such as demand shocks, the optimal choice may be to achieve the inflation target relatively rapidly.", "For other types of disturbances, such as cost shocks, a longer horizon may be optimal, provided that confidence in monetary policy is not in jeopardy.", "Even though, according to the theory, the horizon should be variable, there are some advantages to maintaining a fairly firm horizon that have not been as prominent in the literature.", "It is crucial that the public and market participants understand how the central bank sets the interest rate in order to contribute to confidence and credibility in monetary policy.", "According to the principle normally followed by Norges Bank, the interest rate is set with a view to achieving inflation of 21\u20442 per cent at the two-year horizon.", "If it appears that inflation will be higher than 2.5 per cent, the interest rate will be increased.", "If it appears that inflation will be lower than 2.5 per cent, the interest rate will be lowered.", "This is a clear and simple interest rate setting principle to which the public and market participants can easily relate.", "This kind of simple principle also contributes to reducing uncertainty about the central bank's trade-offs between price stability and stability in output and employment.", "We have no reason to believe that a variable horizon would generally result in substantially higher stability in inflation and output than a two-year horizon.", "In some cases, however, it may be appropriate to change the horizon.", "In situations where the central bank's forecasts indicate that substantial imbalances in the real economy would arise if the interest rate was set so that the inflation forecast two years ahead was the same as the target, it might be appropriate to apply a somewhat longer time horizon.", "The same may be the case if financial stability is at risk.", "The entire path for inflation and the real economy, both before and after the two years, will be taken into account when setting interest rates.", "There are two reasons for this.", "First, there may be several paths that result in inflation of 2.5 per cent at the two-year horizon, and developments after the twoyear period may be important to the choice of path.", "Second, the entire path will be considered when assessing whether there are grounds for changing the horizon.", "We have also begun providing projections for a three-year period in the Report.", "If extraordinary conditions prompt Norges Bank to apply a different time horizon than two years, the Bank will provide a clarification of this.", "However, confidence and credibility in the conduct of monetary policy are necessary before taking such additional considerations into account.", "The greater the confidence in the inflation target, the larger the scope for stabilising the real economy.", "A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rate may be appropriate in cases where there is a risk that inflation might deviate considerably from the target over a longer period, so that inflation expectations might be affected or where heightened turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shock resulting from wage negotiations indicates that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy.", "In Norges Bank's Report, we present our forecasts for both inflation and the output gap in the same chart.", "The reason for this is that we want to be as transparent as possible concerning the tradeoffs made in our conduct of monetary policy.", "Transparency enhances confidence in and the understanding of monetary policy.", "This has been well received internationally, cf.", "the following quote from a presentation by Professor Lars Svensson at a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:9 \"A recent innovation of the Bank of Norway [...] is to plot the inflation forecast and the output-gap forecast in the same graph.", "This clearly serves to emphasize that the bank is concerned with the stability of the real economy as well as with inflation, emphasizing the flexibility in its inflation targeting.\"", "Transparency and communication Confidence in monetary policy makes it easier to achieve the inflation target and increases the possibility of stabilising output and employment.", "Transparency can contribute to strengthening confidence.", "Transparency makes monetary policy more predictable.", "In an environment where market participants understand the

meeting, whether the interest rate is changed or not, where either the central bank governor or deputy governor presents the background for the decision and answers questions.", "The strategy documents, which are published at a later time, should serve to further clarify the tradeoffs and the rationale behind the decision.", "The Inflation Report contains our analyses of the economic situation and projections concerning developments in inflation and output in the next few years.", "These reports provide guidance for market participants and the general public concerning monetary policy in the period ahead.", "Thus far, Norges Bank has generally used two alternative technical assumptions concerning the interest rate in the Inflation Report: that the interest rate follows market expectations, represented by implied forward rates, or that the interest rate remains unchanged.", "We have often used both assumptions, but in the last Inflation Report, we only used forward rates.", "Based on the assumption that the interest rate and the krone exchange rate move in line with the forward interest rate and forward exchange rate respectively, our projection implied that inflation would return to target after two years.", "We interpreted this as an indication that the market's interest rate expectations were consistent with achieving the inflation target at the two-year horizon.", "This type of assumption also provides an internal consistency between interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.", "There are also other possible interest rate assumptions, however.", "We could, for example present an \"optimal\" interest rate scenario, based on model-based calculations and an explicit loss function, or on more judgmental assessments.", "Another alternative is to base future interest rate developments on a simple rule, for example, a variation of the Taylor rule.", "In the inflation reports of The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the interest rate varies over the projection period based on a simple forecast-based interest rate rule.", "Even though these endogenous interest rate paths are a theoretically more satisfactory way of presenting these forecasts, they are not unproblematical.", "For example, an \"optimal\" interest rate path could lead to a misconception that the central bank is committed to setting future interest rates in line with this path, regardless of the shocks that occur.", "An interest rate path based on a simple rule may give the impression that the interest rate is actually set on the basis of this rule.", "In terms of communication, there is no definitive answer as to what are the best interest rate assumptions.", "Sometimes, projections based on specific interest rate assumptions may indicate that the monetary policy objective will not be achieved within a reasonable horizon.", "This will be a signal that the interest rate will probably deviate from these assumptions in the period ahead.", "Monetary policy under uncertainty There is always uncertainty associated with economic projections, but there is also uncertainty concerning the actual state of the economy at the time of the decision.", "Moreover, the effects of our own interest rate setting are uncertain.", "Because most aspects of the future are uncertain, our projections are seldom 100 per cent correct.", "Viewed in retrospect, it might appear that monetary policy could have been conducted better.", "However, interest rate decisions have to be assessed ex ante, in the light of the information that was available at the time that the decisions were made.", "One of the main problems associated with the conduct of monetary policy under uncertainty is access to real time data that provide good information about inflationary pressures in the economy.", "Petter Jacob Bjerve pointed this out in an unusually perspicacious article in 1981 on cyclical policies in Norway in the 1970s: \"It will otherwise always be a problem for economic policy that the statistics are prepared more or less after the events, and that it takes time after the statistics are published before we are aware of whether new trends have begun to emerge.", "[...] Moreover, the analyses were based on projections of productivity growth that proved to be too high.\"", "As I pointed out in my introduction, there was strong growth until 1973, and it took time before it became apparent that there had been a negative shift in potential output.", "The red dotted line in the chart shows what GDP would have been if the growth rate had been the same after 1973 as in the previous 10 years.", "Because the negative shift in the level of potential output was not discovered in time, a counter-cyclical policy was employed in an attempt to sustain the output level.", "Whereas the output gap was believed to be negative, it subsequently proved to be positive, as illustrated by the chart.", "Similarly, in a study of previous US monetary policy, Ophanides11 finds that central banks overestimated the level of output that was consistent with stable inflation in the 1970s because they were not aware of falling productivity growth in time.", "As a result, the output gap was underestimated and policy was too expansionary.", "Also in the 1990s, we saw an increase in productivity growth, and even though the mistake from the 1970s was not repeated, there was a vigorous debate concerning different targets for trend growth and the output gap.", "In addition to the difficulty of capturing changes in potential output fast enough, there is also considerable uncertainty about the level of actual GDP.", "As an example, Norway's GDP figures were extensively revised in June 2002.", "Growth in mainland GDP was revised upwards by an average of 1 percentage point per year for the period 1995-1999.", "The largest revision was for 1999.", "The revised figures now show that growth was in fact 2.7 per cent.", "It is obvious that such revisions can have a considerable impact on the actual output gap.", "Norges Bank is currently systematising different vintages of national accounts figures.", "We can then go back and evaluate monetary policy in \"real time\" to learn how we should respond to uncertain data.", "Frank Knight (1921) differentiates between \"risk\" and \"uncertainty\".", "With risk, we know the probability distribution for the potential outcomes, but with pure uncertainty we do not.", "Thus, there is risk, but not uncertainty, associated with the fall of a die, according to Knight.", "Thus, for a decision-maker, risk is far more manageable than pure uncertainty.", "In practice, the distinction between risk and uncertainty is not absolute; rather, there is a continuous scale.", "We never have complete knowledge of the probability distribution of the economic variables, although historical experience provides some indication.", "But some variables are characterised more by risk, in the sense that the range of outcomes is well specified, than others.", "Let's look at some concrete examples.", "Projections for wage growth are important for the conduct of monetary policy.", "For a given wage formation system, the outcome of wage negotiations is characterised more by risk.", "We do not know with certainty in advance what the outcome will be, but historical experience provides us with information about the probability distribution.", "However, the probability distribution depends on no change having taken place in the wage formation system.", "Such changes may occur, but we have little basis for judging the probability of this.", "If a change has actually taken place, however, we have little information about the probability distribution for the outcome of wage negotiations in the future.", "Whereas wage growth projections were previously characterised more by risk, they are now characterised more by Knight uncertainty.", "Another factor is the rise in prices for imported goods.", "There have been major structural changes in world trade, with intensified competition and China's WTO membership.", "It is still too early to establish the effects of these factors on inflation abroad or how long the process of change in world trade will persist.", "Projections for imported price inflation may therefore be said to be characterised more by Knight uncertainty for a period ahead.", "Monetary policy under uncertainty was one of the many topics discussed in the report Norges Bank Watch 2003, where our policy response pattern and communication were evaluated in the light of the theory of monetary policy under uncertainty.", "This was useful input and constructive criticism which we will keep in mind in our future work.", "Norges Bank Watch 2003 points out, for example, that we should make a clearer distinction between additive uncertainty and multiplicative uncertainty.", "This distinction is most clearly reflected in our economic models.", "The uncertainty associated with the exogenous variables is called additive uncertainty.", "Examples of additive uncertainty are add factors in our economic models and other exogenous factors such as fiscal policy and the oil price.", "Uncertainty about the actual functioning of the economy may, however, lead to multiplicative uncertainty.", "Multiplicative uncertainty often involves uncertainty about the structural parameters in the model, such as the effect of the interest rate on demand and the exchange rate and the slope of the short-term Phillips curve.", "How does the central bank relate to the fact that we do not know precisely how the world is or how it will be in the future?13 Alan Blinder, former Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and currently a professor at Princeton University, touches on this when he formulate the recipe for a successful monetary policy: \u2022 Step 1: Estimate how much you need to tighten or loosen monetary policy to \"get it right.\"", "\u2022 Step 2: Watch developments.", "\u2022 Step 3a: If things work out about as expected, increase your tightening or loosening, toward where you thought it should be in the first place.", "\u2022 Step 3b: If the economy seems to be evolving differently from what you expected, adjust policy accordingly.", "I have not doubt that a number of central banks will sympathise with this recipe.", "Norges Bank normally takes a gradual approach to interest rate setting due to uncertainty concerning economic developments, including the effects of previous changes in the interest rate.", "This principle is also supported by economic theory.", "As early as 1967, Brainard showed that central banks should respond more cautiously to economic disturbances when there is uncertainty as to how strongly the interest rate affects the economy, in other words when there is multiplicative uncertainty.", "On the other hand, according to theory, additive uncertainty, where uncertainty factors are assumed to be independent of the interest rate, shall not be taken into account when setting interest rates.", "Certainty equivalence implies that we make an unbiased projection for the uncertain factor and take the projection into account in the same way as if we knew with certainty that it would occur.", "Theory implies that the central bank should be more aggressive when setting interest rates when faced with certain types of multiplicative uncertainty, for example, uncertainty regarding the extent to which the deviation from the inflation target for a period has an effect on market participants' expectations concerning future inflation.", "This is in line with previous statements from Norges Bank where we state that: The interest rate may be changed rapidly and markedly if there is a risk that inflation might deviate considerably from the target over an extended period so that inflation expectations might be influenced, or when heightened turbulence in financial markets or a rise in costs as a result of negotiated wage increases indicate that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy.", "The fact that academic research is devoting more attention to monetary policy under uncertainty is useful for us practitioners.", "But it is important to be aware that the results in this literature depend, of course, on the assumptions, which are often relatively simple and stylised.", "Therefore, the relevance of the theoretical results to the practical conduct of monetary policy is also uncertain!", "We look at theory with considerable interest, albeit with a certain degree of Brainardian caution.", "The government has defined a mandate for monetary policy that involves flexible inflation targeting.", "In addition to ensuring that inflation is close to 2.5 per cent over time, monetary policy shall also contribute to stabilising developments in output and employment.", "Monetary policy cannot influence the potential output level, but can dampen fluctuations around this level.", "In this way, monetary policy can contribute to stabilising developments in output and employment.", "Inflation cannot be controlled exactly, but it is relatively simple to measure how far it is from the target.", "It is more demanding to measure the gap between actual output and potential output.", "In our operational conduct of monetary policy, we normally set the interest rate with a view to maintaining inflation at 2.5 per cent two years ahead.", "Due to uncertainty, we usually proceed gradually.", "In our opinion, this response pattern will normally result in a reasonable trade-off between stabilising inflation around the target and stabilising output and employment."], "classifications": ["monetary dominance", "monetary
