at par with the international players.", "Benefits of foreign direct investment are manifold ranging from efficiency gains brought about by new technologies to the introduction of innovative products and management techniques.", "Further, more advanced research and development facilities and adoption of best practices from more matured financial markets will contribute to the transfer of skills and knowledge, adoption of sound risk management culture, technology and ideas in the domestic financial system.", "Another consideration in the liberalisation process is that of promoting financial inclusion, where all segments of society will have access to adequate financial services.", "The wide branch network of domestic banking institutions has ensured that non-urban areas have access to banking services, thereby eliminating the use of informal financial services.", "Domestic banking institutions with large presence in the non-urban areas, some as high as 20% of total branches, have succeeded in achieving sustainable performance while meeting this objective.", "Locally incorporated foreign banks are however located mainly in major cities and serve only certain segments of the banking public.", "A wider dispersion of branches of locally-incorporated foreign banks across the country would contribute towards achieving greater financial inclusion.", "For further expansion outside major cities to be a commercially viable proposition, it is recognised that the attainment of critical mass is essential.", "In this regard, in addition to the flexibility accorded to establish up to four new branches, consideration will be given to allow for greater presence in the non-urban areas and to serve the segments of the economy which are currently underserved.", "The banking sector is now in a prime position for the next step in evolution.", "The foundation for the development of a more efficient, effective and stable financial system has been laid.", "The task is
