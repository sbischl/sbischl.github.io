Depression.", "On cost grounds alone, a systematic rethink and reform of regulatory standards has been fully justified.", "While the costs of the global financial crisis are still being counted, it seems likely they will be the largest since at least the Great Depression.", "Two approaches are typically used to gauge these costs of crisis: the cumulative loss of output relative to its trend and the cumulative fiscal costs of supporting the financial Let's take these in turn.", "Chart 1 looks at the path of output relative to a simple measure of its pre-crisis trend in the US, UK, France and Germany after the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Recession of 2008.", "In either case, it is debatable whether estimated trends\" were sustainable, as they may have been artificially inflated by credit booms.", "Nonetheless, it is clear that the output losses from both crises, relative to pre-crisis trends, have been extremely large and long-lasting.", "In the US, the level of output is currently around 13% below a continuation of its pre-crisis trend.", "Ten years into the Great Depression, output was around 28% below its pre-crisis trend.", "Even if not quite on the scale of the 1930s, the global financial crisis has imposed a huge opportunity cost on US citizens.", "In the UK, the losses since the Great Recession, currently at around 16% of pre-crisis GDP, are larger than in the US and indeed larger than those that followed the Great Depression.", "The crisis opportunity costs for UK and euro-area citizens have been the highest for at least a century.", "Much the same

the numerator rising.", "Chart 2 plots these debt-to-GDP ratios, again for the US, UK, France and Germany.", "It suggests that, in the decade after the Great Depression, levels of government debt

- have almost a decade's worth of conceptual, empirical and practical - are now reasonably clear.", "We also additional evidence and research on which to draw when assessing these issues.", "The following sections discuss some of those issues, drawing on new research and evidence: the calibration of regulatory standards, balancing the costs and benefits of tighter regulation; the overall system of financial regulation, balancing underlaps and overlaps, simplicity and complexity, discretion and rules; the impact of reforms on incentives in the financial system, in particular incentives to avoid regulation; and the evolving role of macroprudential regulation in safeguarding stability of the financial system.", "The financial system is dynamic and adaptive.", "So any financial regulatory regime will itself need to be adaptive if it is to contain risk within this system.", "In the terms used by Greenwood et al (2017), resilience needs to be \"dynamic\".", "As past evidence has shown, too rigid a regulatory system will soon become otiose.", "And there are already calls, in some quarters and in some countries, for a rethink and rewrite of regulatory rules on which the ink is barely dry.", "This poses both opportunities and threats.", "The opportunities arise from the need to keep the regulatory framework fresh and agile.", "With the best will in the world, no one could say with certainty how the far-reaching and interwoven reforms to regulation over the past decade will precisely land.", "Judging how the financial system might adapt to future trends in financial technology is even harder to predict.", "As new evidence, incentives and innovation arise in the financial system, the opportunity is created for regulators to learn and adapt the regulatory framework

accounting standards.", "We do not discuss regulatory reforms undertaken nationally, such as the \"Volcker Rule\" in the US (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the \"Vickers proposals\" in the

do not cover changes to banks' large exposures regime and a range of pay and governance reforms.", "Microprudential Reform Under the umbrella of Basel III, international reform of microprudential regulation has focused on four key areas: capital, leverage, liquidity and resolution.", "Taking these in turn: Reform of risk-based capital standards has focused on increasing the quantity and quality of capital held by banks against their asset exposures.", "Minimum regulatory requirements for banks' \"core\" (common equity) capital have been raised from 2% under Basel II to 4.5% under Basel III, even for the smallest banks.", "And allowable deductions to core capital have been reduced.", "On quality of capital, the types of financial instrument eligible as loss-absorbing capital (including for Tier 1) have been tightened considerably.", "For example, certain hybrid capital instruments are no longer eligible, as they were shown during the crisis to be incapable of absorbing loss in situations of stress (Tucker (2013), (2010)).", "These reforms to capital standards have, encouragingly, been implemented in full by nearly all countries internationally (FSB (2017a)).", "Comparing regulatory capital, pre- and post-reform, is not straightforward.", "But taking together changes in both the quantity and quality of capital, it has been estimated that Basel III raised risk-based capital standards for globally systemic banks by a factor of around ten (Cecchetti (2015)).", "One of the new elements of the Basel III package was to supplement risk-weighted capital standards with a risk-unweighted leverage ratio.", "Because this measure does not require banks or regulators to form a judgement on the riskiness of banks' assets, it is in principle simpler, more transparent and less subject to risk-weight arbitrage (Haldane and Madouros (2012)).", "Indeed, those were among the reasons a number of countries, including the US and Canada, had a leverage ratio regime ahead of the crisis.", "The Basel III leverage ratio, set at a minimum level of 3% Tier 1, is due to be implemented internationally by 2018.", "A second new element of the Basel III package was to augment solvency with liquidity-based standards.", "Banks' liquidity has long been a pre-occupation of the Basel Committee (Goodhart (2011)).", "But it took wholesale liquidity runs on the world's largest banks during the crisis to provide the impetus for internationally-agreed liquidity standards.", "Under Basel III, these take the form of a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), designed to ensure banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet their 30-day liquidity needs; and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR), designed to ensure banks' funding profiles are sustainable.", "The LCR has been implemented in full in most countries; the NFSR is due for implementation by 2018.5 During the crisis, a crucial missing ingredient from the financial regulatory architecture was found to be the ability to wind up financial institutions in an orderly fashion that is, while minimising disruption to financial markets and the economy and without exposing tax-payers to risk (FSB (2014)).", "A number of measures have been taken or are in progress to fill this gap, including the introduction of more effective national resolution regimes for financial firms and greater cross-border co-operation and co-ordination when dealing with international banks in situations of stress (FSB (2017c)).", "liabilities which can be in the Another element is to ensure banks have sufficient loss-absorbing \"bailed-in\" event of failure, to prevent losses being shouldered by tax-payers.", "The Financial Stability Board has agreed standards for such Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) for global systemically-important banks (G-SIBs).", "These standards are to be phased-in over coming years, to reach a minimum level of 16% from 2019, and of the resolution group's 18% from 2022, risk-weighted assets, as well as 6% and 6.75% on a leverage exposure basis, respectively.", "Macroprudential Reform These new or augmented microprudential standards have been supplemented with a set of new macroprudential measures.", "These focus on safeguarding the stability of the financial system as a whole (Tucker (2009), Bank of England (2009, 2011)).", "The most significant of these reforms have focused on three areas: macroprudential capital buffers; stress-testing; and shadow banks.", "Historically, capital standards have been static requirements.", "As part of Basel III, a new time-varying component of banks' capital was added - the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB).", "This recognises that And a number of countries, including the UK, introduced leverage ratio capital requirements in the aftermath of the crisis.", "For LCR, see BCBS (2013a): ; for NSFR, see BCBS (2014b): risks to the financial system vary over the credit cycle, typically being highest at its peak and lowest at its trough.", "The CCyB aims to counteract somewhat that time-varying risk profile, with additional capital required during the upswing which can be released during the downswing.", "There is international reciprocity in the setting of the CCyB to reduce incentives for cross-border arbitrage (BCBS (2010a)).", "The framework has been implemented in most jurisdictions.", "Similarly, one of the key lessons of the crisis was that some institutions impose greater degrees of risk on the system because of their size, complexity or interconnectedness (FSB (2010)).", "Basel III recognises the need for these systemically-important firms to carry a structurally higher capital requirement, currently of up to 3.5%, to help mitigate the additional risk they bring to the system.", "These capital add-ons apply to the 30 designated global systemically-important banks (G-SIBs) and the roughly 160 domestic systemically- important banks (D-SIBs), to be phased-in between 2016 and 2019.", "Stress tests were used by regulators before the crisis to assess whether banks had sufficient capital to withstand an adverse tail event.", "But these tests tended to be neither comprehensive nor transparent.", "In 2009, the US authorities undertook a comprehensive stress test of the major US banks and published the results.", "For banks failing the test, regulatory restrictions on their behaviour were imposed.", "For some people, this marked the turning point for the US financial system.", "A comprehensive annual stress-testing exercise is now undertaken in the US.", "More recently, the US has been joined by the UK and the EU, among others.", "Finally, one of the striking features of the pre-crisis financial system was the emergence of the so-called \"shadow\" banking system.", "In the US, on some definitions, this grew to exceed in size the conventional banking system (Pozsar et al (2010)).", "Since the crisis, reform efforts have focused on two areas.", "First, specific reforms have been enacted to sectors which, during the crisis, were found to contain fault-lines - for example, Money Market Mutual Funds (IOSCO (2012)).", "Second, a framework has been put in place by the FSB to define and measure shadow banking entities, to publish data on them to enhance market discipline and to help authorities identify, and develop policy tools for mitigating, the risks they might pose (FSB (2013a)).", "The FSB have recently put forward a package of recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from the asset management sector (FSB (2017d)).", "Supporting this package of regulatory reforms, micro- and macroprudential, have been initiatives to boost the quantity and quality of reporting by financial institutions.", "These should help in pricing institution-specific risk by financial markets and ratings agencies.", "Notable initiatives have included: enhanced Pillar 3 disclosures by banks, covering all aspects of the

160 D-SIBs.", "For each bank, we consider two solvency-based metrics (leverage and risk-weighted capital) and two liquidity-based metrics (a simple liquid asset ratio and the ratio of loans to deposits).", "These measures do not map precisely to Basel definitions.", "looks at a measure of banks' Tier 1 Chart 4 risk-weighted capital ratios.", "For both G-SIBs and D-SIBs in our sample, these have risen significantly over the past decade, almost doubling from around 7-8% to around 13-14%.", "A very similar picture emerges for leverage ratios (Chart 5).", "These have also roughly doubled over the past decade, from around 3% to around 6%.", "On these metrics, there has been a material strengthening in solvency-based standards among systemically-important banks over the past decade.", "This is also the case for measures of TLAC (see Chart 6 for a sample of UK banks).", "Liquidity metrics show a similar pattern of improvement.", "For example, liquid asset ratios - high-quality liquid assets as a fraction of the total balance sheet have risen from around 6% in 2008 to more than 8% (Chart 7), though the increase is more muted for D-SIBs.", "Meanwhile, the ratio of loans to deposits (LTD) has also improved, with lending backed by a larger share of stable sources of funding than before the crisis (Chart 8).", "Market-Based Metrics A second set of metrics of bank solvency and liquidity focus on financial market perceptions of bank risk.", "There are a wide variety of potential such metrics, each with their own imperfections, including measures of default such as CDS spreads, bond yields and ratings; measures of volatility, such as option-implied volatilities; and measures of profitability, such as price-earnings ratios.", "These are summarised and evaluated in

pre-crisis under-pricing of risk; a rapid re-pricing of default risk during the crisis; and a subsequent partial unwind.", "CDS spreads today sit roughly midway between their pre-crisis and mid-crisis averages.", "Bank bond spreads and ratings tell a similar story.", "Assuming pre-crisis banking risk was materially under-priced, this evidence is consistent with regulatory reform having boosted the

G-SIBs and D-SIBs.", "This currently lies well below its historic average and little different than unity.", "Put differently, if we used a measure of banks' capital ratios using the market rather than the book value of their equity, this would suggest a far smaller degree of improvement in measured bank solvency and resilience (Chart 11), though the effect is less pronounced for D-SIBs.", "Sarin and Summers (2016) reconcile these market movements by appealing to the shifts in the franchise value of banks.", "Improved solvency standards have decreased the perceived default risk of banks.", "But coincident with lower risk are lower returns activities, due to the combined effects of stricter regulation, misconduct fines, low levels of interest rates and increased competition.",

bond-holders and depositors in banks.", "\"By and large\" because, accompanying these changes in banks' capital standards, has been a move towards putting losses from default onto bond-holders.",

levels of capital and liquidity in the banking system are at levels significantly below those 100 and 50 years ago, respectively.", "On the face of it, this gives grounds for questioning whether even these revamped regulatory standards are sufficient to withstand likely future shocks.", "We should, however, probably be cautious about jumping too quickly to that conclusion.", "Over the past century, there has been significant change in the structure of the financial system, including in the structure, scale and scope of financial regulation and the safety net.", "Those changes could mean that simple, historical comparisons of regulatory standards are misleading.", "Admati and Hellwig (2013) provide a comprehensive and lucid account of the case for higher capital centres on the fact that the impact of higher capital standards on banks' overall standards.", "Their argument cost of capital needs to take account of the lower risk that arises from this shift - the Modigliani-Miller offset (Modigliani and Miller (1958)).", "It needs also to distinguish between any private costs to banks from tighter regulation and the social benefits this confers, with the latter the key public policy yardstick.", "When it came to re-calibrating regulatory standards for capital and liquidity after the crisis, international regulators engaged in a detailed, quantitative exercise which sought to weigh these social costs and benefits of tighter regulation, drawing on existing empirical evidence.", "The Long-Term Economic Impact (LEI) study, published by the Basel Committee in 2010, is a useful starting point for discussion of the appropriate calibration of regulatory standards (BCBS (2010b)).", "The main conclusion from this work was that, under conservative assumptions about likely economic costs, there were positive economic benefits to society from a sizeable increase in the capital banks were required to maintain.", "The study did not settle on an optimal level of bank capital.", "But the results presented were consistent with societal benefits peaking at a Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of between 16-19%.", "This is most global banks' current north of capital ratios.", "The range of published estimates in the LEI study reflected different assumptions about the persistence of the effects of crises on GDP, an area of particular empirical uncertainty in the academic literature.", "A contemporaneous study by Miles et al (2013) concluded that optimal capital requirements were likely to be higher perhaps around 20% - if account was taken of the offsetting risk and cost of capital effects of higher solvency standards (the Modigliani-Miller offset).", "It is useful to revisit the calibration in the LEI study in the light of subsequent research.", "A little notation may be useful to organise this evidence.", "Suppose the aim of policy is to keep output in the economy, y, as close These figures are expressed in terms of current definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets.", "The mapping from the estimates reported in the LEI report and those above are due to Brooke et al (2015).", "as possible to its trend growth path, y\u0305.", "The objective for the authorities is then to minimise a loss function, which can be written as: Let's simplify further and assume two factors can cause output to deviate from its trend: first, higher capital requirements, k, which act to reduce output each period by \u03b4; and second, the occurrence of a financial crisis which, with probability \u03b3, leads to a discrete drop in output of \u2206.", "That is: = - \u03b4k - \u03b3(k)\u0394(k) This captures the view that higher bank capital could reduce credit supply, and hence economic activity, in the near term.", "But by making the financial system more resilient to future shocks, it may also reduce the tail risk of bad macroeconomic outcomes.", "Both probability and severity of crises are influenced negatively by the level of bank capital, with the < 0, \u03b3\u2032\u2032(k) > 0, \u2206\u2032(k) < 0, \u2206\u2032\u2032(k) > - relationship likely to be convex (\u03b3\u2032(k) 0) that is to say, one would expect a one percentage point increase in the capital ratio to have a larger dampening impact on the probability and severity of crisis when banks are close to their regulatory minima than when capital buffers are plentiful.", "In this stylised set-up, the marginal condition that defines optimal bank capital is: \u03b4 = -\u0394 - \u03b3 Optimal capital is higher the lower is \u03b4, the economic cost of a marginal increase in capital requirements; the greater are and \u0394, the likelihood and severity of crises; and the greater are and the marginal effects of capital on the likelihood and severity of crises.", "So what have we learned over the past decade about the likely magnitude of these parameters?", "The Benefits of Higher Capital Requirements The assumptions underpinning the marginal benefits of higher capital in the LEI study were as follows: banking crises occur, on average, once every 20-25 years; the median estimate of the cumulative discounted costs of a crisis is around 60% of annual pre-crisis GDP; each percentage point increase in the capital ratio reduces the probability of a banking crisis by a smaller amount, ranging from 1.4% to 1% (for a capital increase from 10% to 11%) to 0.4% to 0.3% (for a capital increase from 14% to 15%); and, finally, the level of bank capital has no impact on the severity of crisis.", "Since the LEI report, a rich seam of the literature has emerged on the determinants of crises and their severity (\u2206).", "Some of the most illuminating pieces of this research have drawn on evidence from a long historical time-series and across multiple countries (for example, Jorda\u0300 et al (2013), Taylor (2015)).", "The key findings are as follows.", "First, credit booms are probably the single most important determinant both of the likelihood of crises and of economic performance in the recovery after them (Schularick and Taylor (2012), Jorda\u0300 et al (2013)).", "A sustained 1 percentage point increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio raises the probability of crisis from 4% to around 4.3% per year.", "It also raises the severity of a crisis, with real GDP per capita almost 1% lower after five years.", "Colleagues at the Bank of England have considered whether it is the level of credit, or its growth, prior to a crisis that matters most for subsequent economic performance (Bridges et al (2017)).", "They find that credit growth has historically been a significant predictor of crisis severity, whereas the level of indebtedness appears less important.", "Second, not all forms of credit are equal.", "In the post-WWII era, mortgage credit growth has been the dominant driver of financial crisis risk.", "And growth in mortgages, rather than in other forms of credit, is the key determinant of the drag in the recovery phase from crisis (Jorda\u0300 et al (2017)).", "Third, asset prices are also important with 'leveraged bubbles' - synchronised house price and mortgage credit booms - particularly dangerous (Jorda\u0300 et al (2015)).", "Taken together, this evidence is consistent with the probability (\u03b3) and output costs of credit crises (\u2206) being at least as large as assumed in the original LEI study, perhaps larger, given the still-high levels of the credit-to-GDP ratio in most countries, and the monetary and fiscal space available to the authorities at present relative to the average of the past a recent paper by Romer and Romer (2017) presents evidence that this factor is a significant determinant of crisis severity.", "The still-accumulating output losses during the from this time's crisis would also point in this direction recovery phase (Chart 1).", "What role does higher bank capital play in reducing the likelihood of financial crises ( or their severity (\u2202\u2206 \u2202k)?", "At least for the likelihood of crisis, subsequent evidence has tended to be rather ambiguous.", "Historical evidence, using aggregate economy-wide covariates, has reached the perhaps surprising conclusion that bank capital ratios have virtually no predictive power for the occurrence of financial crises in major advanced economies (Jorda\u0300 (2017)).", "That is, is indistinguishable from zero.", "This result holds both in the full sample (1870-2013) and in the post-WWII period.", "Micro-econometric studies on the link between bank failure and bank capital have found a more tangible relationship, however.", "For example, Vazquez and Federico (2015) find that US and EU banks with stronger This echoes and extends findings from earlier research by Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and Lowe (2004) and Drehmann, Borio and Tsatsaronis (2011), which found credit gap measures to be key determinants of crisis risk.", "pre-crisis capital and structural liquidity positions were less likely to fail.", "Berger and Bouwman (2013) report a similar finding using a longer-run data set of US banks.", "And a recent study by IMF economists finds that risk-based capital ratios in the range 15-23% would have been sufficient to absorb losses in the vast majority of past advanced economy banking crises (Dagher et al (2016)).", "At the time of the Basel Committee's study, there was little evidence on the impact of bank capital on the severity of crises (\u2202\u2206 which is why this channel was ignored in the quantitative calibration.", "Jorda\u0300 et al (2017) find that, while bank capital does not prevent a crisis from occurring, it matters for the pain suffered in its aftermath.", "They find that real GDP per head is 5 per cent higher 5 years after the onset of a crisis-related recession if bank capital is above its historical average when the crisis hits.", "The benefits of capital in reducing the severity of crisis are also borne out by experience since the crisis.", "Chart 15 plots international banks' ratios prior to the crisis against their subsequent lending growth.", "The relationship has a statistically significant upward slope.", "Banks that entered the crisis with higher capital have, on average, been better able to continue their lending.", "On average, each extra 1 percentage point of pre-crisis capital boosted cumulative lending over the subsequent decade by over 20%.", "This finding is corroborated by micro-econometric evidence.", "Carlson (2013) find that US banks with higher pre-crisis capital ratios had stronger loan growth in its aftermath, with the effect particularly pronounced at lower capital ratios.", "Cornett et al (2011) and Kapan and Minoiu (2013) report that banks relying more heavily on stable sources of funding, such as core deposits and equity capital, continued to lend relative to other banks during the crisis.", "And Jimenez (2014) find that, in periods of economic weakness, loan

market-wide loss of wholesale funding, the like of which was exhibited during the crisis.", "In this way, it may potentially reduce the probability of damaging asset fire-sales, liquidity hoarding and

these differences evolve over the cycle.", "An Empirical Assessment of Regulatory Metrics There are conceptual reasons why a portfolio approach to regulatory design, with a small, complementary set of constraints, may have merit in a robust control sense: addressing the different risks facing financial institutions and providing insurance against various uncertainties.", "Ultimately, however, the

about the risks banks faced and how different regulatory constraints might have handled them.", "For example, recent research has found the leverage ratio and structural funding metrics performed well

ratio but this is a relatively poor proxy for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), so we exclude consideration of the LCR from this analysis.", "Because very few banks technically defaulted during the crisis, but many would have without significant government intervention, the definition of failure is necessarily somewhat judgemental.", "Beyond clear-cut cases of default or nationalisation, Laeven and Valencia (2010) define banks to have failed if at least three of the following six conditions were present: (i) extensive liquidity support (5 percent of deposits and liabilities to non-residents); (ii) bank restructuring costs (at least 3 percent of GDP); (iii) partial bank nationalisation (eg government recapitalisation); (iv) significant guarantees put in place; (v) significant asset purchases (at least 5 percent of GDP); (vi) metric the leverage ratio.", "And using this metric, suppose that we set a cut-off threshold consistent with a particular calibration of that regulatory standard - a leverage ratio of 3%.", "the 'hit rate' as the One can identify banks which operated below that standard at a point in time.", "We define number of banks which had a leverage ratio below 3% at the end of 2006 and subsequently failed during the crisis, relative to the total number of banks that failed.", "And we define the 'false alarm rate' as the number of banks with a leverage ratio below 3% which survived, relative to the total number of banks that survived.", "If a 3% leverage ratio could perfectly discriminate, its hit rate would be 100% and false alarm rate 0%.", "Now suppose that we have flexibility over the cut-off threshold necessary to achieve a particular hit rate, x.", "At the same time, we wish to minimise false alarms.", "As the leverage ratio cut-off increases, the hit rate and false alarm rate must both go up.", "The key question is by how much each goes up the relative balance of marginal benefits and marginal costs of hits and false alarms as the leverage ratio cut-off increases.", "Chart 17 plots the settings of the leverage ratio needed to achieve particular target hit rates.", "Chart 18, meanwhile, plots what is referred to as operating characteristic' (ROC) curve.", "Using the sequence of cut-off thresholds for the leverage ratio from Chart 17, this plots the sequence of associated hit rates and corresponding false alarm rates at different settings of the leverage ratio, alongside the 45 degree line which corresponds to the performance of a completely uninformative metric.", "Two points are clear from these charts.", "First, it is possible to achieve relatively high hit rates of up to 70% at relatively modest calibrations of the leverage ratio of under 4% and with relatively low false alarm rates of around 30%.", "This suggests that, with the benefit of hindsight and abstracting from definitional changes which affect the interpretation of specific numbers, a leverage ratio of around 4% before the crisis would not have been met by around 70% of banks which subsequently ended up failing.", "It served as a decent signal of subsequent failure.", "Clearly, such banks might still have failed during the crisis even with a leverage ratio of above 4%.", "But the low false alarm rate at that calibration, corresponding to the observation that most banks which survived the crisis had a leverage ratio of above 4% going into it, indicates that such a constraint may have helped to curtail their risk-taking, as measured by their leverage ratio, and reduced their likelihood of failure.", "Second, to achieve high hit rates of above 80%, both the calibration of the leverage ratio and the false alarm rate increase sharply.", "Achieving a 90% hit rate with a leverage ratio alone requires its calibration to be boosted to around 5.7%.", "Even then, it comes at the cost of a high false alarm rate of over 80%.", "In other words, the balance of marginal benefits to costs becomes notably less positive when using a singular deposit freezes and bank holidays.", "Aikman et al (2014) discuss where the classification of failure departs from Laeven and Valencia (2010).", "instrument if policymakers have a low tolerance for failure.", "That matters if, for example, the costs of higher capital requirements increase non-linearly (Greenwood et al (2017)).", "These points are also evident if we assess individually the performance of the RWCR and NSFR.", "Chart 18 and Table 3 below show that hit rates of 80 or 90% can only be achieved with high false alarm rates and stringent calibrations of these metrics.", "Overall, each metric individually does somewhat worse than the leverage ratio in balancing hit and false alarm rates.", "And similar results hold when the loan to deposit (LTD) ratio is considered instead of the NSFR in the wider sample (Chart 19).", "This now requires the setting of three cut-off thresholds and so gives more degrees of freedom.", "But the objective otherwise remains the same, namely achieving a particular hit rate for signalling bank failures while minimising false alarms.", "Chart 18 and Table 4 show the results from these multi-constraint simulations.", "At targeted hit rates of over 80%, however, that picture changes.", "The ROC curve for the regulatory portfolio lies to the left of all those corresponding to individual metrics.", "In other words, it is possible to achieve lower false alarm rates, for the same hit rate, when multiple regulatory metrics are used.", "The calibration of each metric in the portfolio is also less stringent than the calibration for each metric individually.", "These results hold when comparing any pair of regulatory metrics with individual metrics a higher hit rate per false alarm rate, with less stringent calibrations.", "It also holds even more strongly in the wider 96-bank sample when the LTD ratio is considered instead of the NSFR (Chart 19).", "This suggests that, at least in this sample, imposing a small number of regulatory constraints can achieve the same hit rate as any singular constraint, but at a materially lower societal and regulatory cost, as measured by levels of capital and liquidity and/or regulatory false alarms.", "Intuitively, these results broadly accord with the conceptual discussion.", "A regulatory portfolio can help when insuring against multiple sources of risk and myriad sources of uncertainty.", "It also accords with what we know from various individual case studies of bank failure during the global financial crisis: some banks failed because they were over-leveraged, others because their assets were excessively risky, others still because they undertook too much maturity transformation.", "Because these fault-lines were, for some banks, reasonably well-correlated their risk management was poor across all dimensions - individual regulatory metrics performed fairly well in identifying these banks prior

have been required to raise capital.", "But its NSFR was just 0.76, indicative of the structural liquidity risk it was undertaking.", "By including the NSFR in the suite of regulatory metrics, it would have been possible to capture the risks that Countrywide was undertaking without resorting to materially more stringent capital regulation.", "By contrast, Belgian bank KBC Group had an NSFR of 1.12, above the current indicative regulatory standard.", "For that time, it also had a reasonable risk-weighted capital ratio of 8.7%, well above the median capital ratio in the sample.", "But its leverage ratio was 3.5%.", "A system of regulation excluding the leverage ratio would have been unable to capture risks of the type KBC Group was undertaking prior to the crisis.", "The message from this counterfactual exercise, for all its obvious imperfections, is that multiple regulatory metrics may have helped historically in capturing the multiple dimensions of risk and uncertainty exhibited by banks pre-crisis.", "With the benefit of hindsight, multiple metrics would have helped identify most failing banks, without either high false alarm rates or potentially punitive calibrations of

diversity in the financial system.", "Excessive homogeneity of the financial system can create systemic risks (Haldane (2009a), Wagner (2010)).", "How much it does so is, however, a matter of degree.", "If regulatory constraints act as control bounds on structurally defective business models, that strengthens the financial system, even if (indeed, precisely because) it constrains diversity.", "Empirical evidence suggests this latter effect dominated during the recent crisis.", "(ii) Discretion versus Rules The new architecture has introduced measures which are likely to make for a greater degree of supervisory or policymaker discretion in the setting of regulatory standards.", "This arises, most obviously, in the application of supervisory judgement to certain risks that banks face, to stress-testing and to macroprudential policy.", "Multiple regulatory rules have been augmented with considerable supervisory discretion.", "Viewed in \"constrained discretion\".",

regulatory framework has some similarities with the prevailing monetary policy framework in a number of countries (Bernanke and Mishkin (1997)).", "These regimes have been found to be an effective way of balancing the pre-commitment necessary to avoid policy time-consistency problems with the flexibility necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances (Arestis and Mihailov (2009), Borio (2010)).",

are operated.", "The time-inconsistency problem that pervades the debate over the balance between rules and discretion in monetary policy (Kydland and Prescott (1977), Barro and Gordon (1983)) is arguably even more acute for prudential policy.", "This is partly because adverse crisis outcomes are highly non-linear and costly, making it more difficult to pre-commit to avoiding forbearance and bail-out.", "The low probability of crises may also mean that policymakers are insufficiently tough in tackling financial sector risks when times are good and memories of previous crises distant

powerful, interest groups in the financial industry.", "And while higher than target inflation is quickly observable, it may be very difficult to judge in real time that regulation is insufficiently stringent given the difficulties of quantifying the probability of future financial crises.", "These arguments point to the need for strong institutional frameworks, supported by clear mandates, objectives and instruments, to deliver financial stability policy.", "Indeed, on conceptual grounds, the need for such a framework appears to be at least as strong, if not stronger, than for monetary policy.", "They also support the case for clarity in the application of these regulatory policies.", "Not least given its newness, there may be further to go clarifying the motivation behind macroprudential interventions and the circumstances which might justify different macroprudential instruments - in short, in defining and refining the macroprudential policy reaction function.", "The

counterfactually, might have done in spotting stress among a set of banks.", "Plainly, any such counterfactual exercise is subject to significant caveats.", "The most important of these is that it cannot take account of how changes in the regulatory regime might themselves have reshaped risk-taking incentives at the time.", "This Lucas Critique plainly looms large in the field of financial regulation.", "Financial regulation, like any tax, is very likely to change the behaviour of the party subject to it.", "This is neither surprising nor, necessarily, undesirable.", "Indeed, sometimes it is the precise purpose of the regulation in the first place.", "For example, average risk weights on assets held in the trading book have increased by 45% across a sample of major UK banks between 2006 and 2013.", "Partly in response, trading books have shrunk by, on average, 24% across these banks and by 45% world's G-SIBs.", "This was an intended, and probably desirable, behavioural response

degree.", "In response to tighter financial regulation, risk is likely to change shape or location, often both.", "This is not just a conceptual point.", "The history of financial regulation can be seen as an on-going, evolutionary race to adjust regulatory rules to limit avoidance incentives (Haldane (2013)).", "The first Basel Accord (\"Basel I\") was a direct response to cross-border regulatory arbitrage.", "Basel II came largely as the result of standardised approaches to risk measurement being arbitraged.", "And Basel III came in part as a response to both risk models, and the Basel framework itself, being arbitraged.", "This race has been characterised as \"bloodhounds in pursuit of greyhounds\" (Eichengreen (2009)).", "Regulators need both to learn from past experience

activity and risk to unregulated \"shadow banks\" (Adrian and Ashcraft crisis.", "These included (2012)); the hard-wiring of rating agency risk assessments into the regulatory engine (Edmonds (2016)); the payment of bank CEOs in common equity encouraging \"gambling for resurrection\" (IMF (2014)); and the implicit subsidies conferred on \"too-big-to-fail\" institutions, encouraging them to become larger and more complex and connected still (FSB (2013b)).", "Another example of these incentive effects came in the area of capital regulation.", "Whichever risk-weighting scheme is in place, it is likely to give rise to incentives to adjust asset positions to maximise profits.", "For example, if the regulatory constraint takes the form of a leverage ratio there are incentives to alter the composition of assets towards those with higher risk weights though the evidence on such \"risk-shifting\" is and determined by banks' mixed (Sheldon (1996), Furlong (1988)).", "Contrarily, if assets are risk-weighted internal models, there are incentives to lower modelled risk weights over time (Mariathasan and Merrouche (2014)).", "In short, when setting capital standards for banks, there is a two-sided incentive problem.", "Pre-crisis, both incentives were at play, albeit to differing degrees in different parts of the global financial system.", "In the US, where a leverage ratio was in operation and often the binding constraint, there were incentives for banks to seek higher-risk assets rather than expand balance sheets (Chart 20).", "In Europe, without a leverage ratio but with risk-based capital standards, there were incentives for banks to expand balance sheets and shade downwards risk weights.", "Canadian banks' incentives sat somewhere in between.", "Some recent studies have looked at these behavioural shifts in greater detail.", "During the euro-area crisis, banks increased their exposure toward higher risk government bonds, which carried no capital requirement (Acharya and Steffen (2015)).", "And following the Lehman crisis, German banks reduced their corporate lending less when the capital requirement was set under the standardised approach (Behn, Haselmann, Wachtel (2016)).", "In the UK, higher risk mortgages shifted towards lenders whose capital requirements were less risk-sensitive after the introduction of Basel II (Benetton et al

increase in risk-taking among those banks for whom the new regime was a binding constraint.", "This risk-taking was greater, the further these banks were from meeting the new 3% threshold: banks with leverage ratios of 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% were found to increase their risk-taking by 3.4, 2.3 and 1.1 percentage points of risk-weighted assets respectively.", "This is clear empirical evidence of the risk-shifting channel at work.", "This is only, however, one side of the risk equation.", "There were two mitigating factors on the other side.", "a rise in the leverage ratio also boosts these banks' First, capital.", "Once translated into default probabilities, Acosta-Smith et al (2017) find that the second effect swamps the first: a one percentage point rise in the leverage ratio raises the odds ratio (on banks being in distress versus safe) through risk-shifting by 1-3.5%.", "But the reduction in the odds ratio from lower leverage is close to 40-50%.", "Second, the leverage regime is not a replacement for the risk-weighted capital regime but an addition to it.", "The capital regime places an automatic upper-bound on the extent to which banks can increase their risk-weighted assets.", "In other words, the capital ratio regime places constraints on incentives to risk-shift.", "Conversely, the leverage ratio can serve as an effective constraint on incentives to game or shade risk weights.", "Risk-taking incentives are, in effect, book-ended by the leverage and capital constraints.", "From an incentives perspective, if regulatory arbitrage incentives are two-sided, so too should be the constraints needed to straightjacket that behaviour.", "That is another way of rationalising the regulatory regime operating internationally.", "When it comes to calibration, this means leverage and capital ratios need to be jointly determined to prevent incentives skewing in one or other direction.", "This is the approach in the UK when setting capital and leverage constraints (Bank of England (2015a)).", "There are other means of constraining adverse incentives.", "Incentives to game risk weights can be constrained by imposing floors and/or by using standardised approaches for certain categories of assets.", "Some countries already make use of such approaches, including the US, the UK, Germany, France and Spain.", "The stress-testing regimes operating in a number of countries are also a way of cross-checking, and backstopping, the models used by banks.", "In a world of uncertainty as well as risk, having this portfolio of approaches for dealing with avoidance

England has conducted a lab experiment to assess how the design of pay regulation may affect risk-taking behaviour and project search effort (Harris et al (forthcoming)).", "Specifically, the experiment was designed to examine how caps on bonuses and \"malus\" (bonuses that are not paid out if, for example, performance falters in subsequent years) might affect individuals' risk choices and efforts to seek out the best projects.", "The experiment showed evidence that, while both schemes tend to reduce risk-taking, they could be arbitraged relatively easily by introducing absolute or relative performance targets.", "There was also some evidence that a bonus cap might reduce incentives to search for good projects.", "The Bank of England is considering extending this experimental approach to a wider range of policy design questions and a wider range of financial market participants - risk-takers and risk-managers.", "In principle, this approach might provide some early indications of how new regulation might reshape risk incentives, including arbitrage incentives, which could help in recrafting regulation before it is introduced.", "Macroprudential Policy One of the greatest intellectual errors made in the run-up to the crisis was a classic \"fallacy of composition\": it was assumed that the resilience of individual financial institutions was both a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the resilience of the financial system as a whole.", "Events during the crisis, and See BCBS (2016): and BCBS (2013b): subsequent theoretical and empirical work, has shown that the resilience of individual firms is neither necessary nor sufficient for the mitigation of systemic risk (Masera (2014), Crockett (1996)).", "Out of this intellectual vacuum, a new framework for regulation has been born macroprudential regulation.", "This explicitly recognises the links that might tie together individual nodes in the financial system.", "These might arise from

the liquidity premium in bond spreads by 40 basis points.", "Moreover, redemptions of as little as 1.3% of total assets exhaust the dealer's capacity to intermediate trades, leading to a market 'freeze'.", "In a similar spirit, Braun-Munzinger et al (2016) develop an agent-based model of the corporate bond market comprising a market maker, fund traders and fund investors.", "They find that

positive and negative effects on volatility: they decrease yield volatility on average, but can increase the likelihood of large dislocations after shocks.", "While this fire-sale mechanism applies most directly to financial intermediaries with marked-to-market balance sheets, and funds that can be redeemed at short notice, a similar dynamic can operate if there are forced sales by owners of, or

to answer about whether multiple regulatory constraints could lead to excessive homogeneity and inefficiency in the financial system.", "And arbitrage is an ever-present threat, even with multiple regulatory metrics.", "This is an area where further research and practical experience with operating the new regime will be essential in gauging whether there is scope for streamlining, provided the resulting regulatory regime remains robust to the radical uncertainty that necessarily affects any complex, adaptive system such as finance.", "FSB (2017e), for example, describes a Policy Evaluation Framework to achieve efficient resilience.", "(c) Models of Financial Stability: In a world of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy, all having an impact on the economy and on the financial system, there is an increased onus on developing quantitative frameworks which enable us to understand their impact, individually and collectively, and their interaction (Bank of England (2015b)).", "That calls for models able to capture quantitatively monetary, financial and regulatory channels of transmission and the feedback mechanisms between them.", "Progress has been made, in particular since the crisis, in developing macro-models with an explicit financial sector which can capture rich, two-way feedbacks between the economy and financial system (for example, Brunnermeier et al (2012), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)).", "There has been progress, too, in developing models of systemic risk which assign macroeconomic factors, and within-system feedbacks, a prominent role (Greenwood et al (2014), Cont and Schaanning (2017)).", "Yet we are still probably in the foothills when developing a unified framework for bringing these factors together in one place, a framework that could capture the rich feedback and amplification mechanisms that operate in practice and a model which could then serve as a test-bed for each of the three arms of policy.", "Indeed, it could be that a single, Holy Grail, framework is infeasible or indeed undesirable.", "(d) Future of Stress-Testing: Bank stress testing has evolved considerably since the financial crisis and is now a cornerstone of the regulatory regime in many jurisdictions.", "The direction of travel necessary to enrich these tests, and to make them truly macroprudential, is to incorporate feedback effects that can amplify the actions of individual institutions at the system-wide level (Demekas (2015), Brazier (2015), Tarullo (2016)) feedbacks, for instance, that result from fire-selling assets, hoarding liquidity and counterparty risk.", "A natural consequence is that we might need to extend the field of vision for such simulations to include non- bank parts of the financial system.", "Non-bank sources of systemic risk proved to be potent during the crisis, in particular among shadow banks.", "As regulation has squeezed the banking system, there has been further migration of financial activity into the shadows, particularly within Europe.", "What was once credit and funding risk on the balance sheets of banking firms is metamorphosing into market and liquidity risk on the balance sheets of funds and investment vehicles of various types (Stein (2013)).", "Understanding these risks calls for new and enhanced surveillance tools.", "Systematic, market-wide stress simulations might be needed to capture new market and liquidity risks and their propagation across different financial institutions and markets (Brazier (2017b)).", "The same considerations apply to key pieces of the financial infrastructure, in particular central counterparties (Coeure\u0301 (2017), Duffie (2017)).", "As a potentially new \"too big to fail\" entity, they too need to be stress-tested and their resolution plans agreed and implemented.", "This is a whole new risk-management agenda, where work has only just begun in earnest.", "(e) Market-Based Finance: The emergence of a large and diverse shadow banking system, both prior to the crisis in the US and subsequent to it elsewhere around the world, plainly poses both considerable opportunities and potential threats to financial stability.", "So-called market-based finance provides the financial system with a second, non-bank, engine on which to fly which could be beneficial in a diversity For example, the results of the Bank of England's 2014 stress test found that risk-weight procyclicality was a significant contributor to the change in capital ratios in the stress test scenario (Bank of England (2014)).", "Nonetheless, it also gives rise to potentially new sources of systemic risk and contagion, as risks change shape and location.", "The FSB has made significant progress in progressing the regulatory debate on such matters (FSB (2017e)).", "Certainly, these trends carry implications for both the conduct of regulation and for central bank procedures.", "A world of greater market and liquidity risk may call for different sets of regulatory instrument than the bank-based solvency and liquidity metrics of Basel III.", "Market-based instruments, such as margin requirements, may have a greater role to play (see, for example, ESRB (2017)).", "It may also call for different types of market intervention by central banks different markets, different instruments, different counterparties.", "The crisis has already seen a mini-revolution in the design of liquidity facilities by central banks.", "As the financial system changes shape, it seems plausible to think that further change could be necessary.", "If so, that change would benefit from further research on the costs and benefits of the extended regulatory and central bank safety net.", "(f) The Macroprudential Policy Framework: As a still-fledgling framework, there are a wide range of questions still surrounding the macroprudential framework.", "There is no settled, practical approach to defining the breadth of objectives of a macroprudential regime.", "Should the potential for aggregate demand externalities associated with a debt overhang in the household sector, for instance, fall under the purview of a macroprudential authority?", "Nor, in the main, is there any settled approach to defining the appropriate set of macroprudential instruments, whether for banks or especially for non-banks, or the optimal strategy for their use to address emerging vulnerabilities.", "If household debt externalities are within scope, is it better to deal with this risk by restricting mortgage lending directly via loan to income or loan to value limits, or by adding a macroprudential overlay to risk weights on mortgages (Turner (2017))?", "This lack of a settled approach has some benefits, in making for a diverse range of cross-country experiences.", "This is giving rise to a period of \"learning by doing\" among regulators.", "It does, however, come at some cost.", "A regime without especially well-defined objectives is likely to suffer greater problems of time-inconsistency.", "It may also increase uncertainty among outside participants about the likely regulatory policy reaction function.", "The direction of travel, over time, probably needs to be towards somewhat clearer constraints, and somewhat more circumscribed discretion, if macroprudential regimes are to be effective, robust and transparent.", "(g) Political Economy of Financial Regulation: The scope and range of regulatory responsibilities assigned to central banks and regulators have expanded materially during the course of the crisis.", "Accompanying that, some of the new regulatory requirements and practices put in place are quite discretionary in nature, including stress-testing and some other macroprudential measures.", "A number involve regulators making overtly distributional choices, for example around access to credit.", "This takes central banks and reguIators more explicitly into the political-economy realm than at any time in their recent (and perhaps distant) history.", "It has probably also contributed to some people questioning the appropriate scope of central banking, its degree of independence from the political process and from wider society and appropriate accountability mechanisms.", "There is a debate to be had, an analytical debate, about the appropriate degree of discretion to confer on regulators, to ensure they retain the flexibility they need to respond to events while ensuring their decisions are clear, transparent and unpolluted by behavioural biases and time-inconsistency problems.", "There are also interesting issues to explore about how regulators explain and account for their decisions to wider society, particularly when they have strongly distributional consequences.", "This is clearly unfinished business.", "(h) The Contribution of the Financial System to the Economy and to Society: One of the striking features of the past several decades has been the rising share of financial services in measures of economy-wide value-added and, in tandem, rising financial sector balance sheets as a fraction of GDP in a number of economies.", "Sometimes this goes by the name \"financialisation\".", "There are good reasons to think increasing financial depth is a natural feature of economies as they grow and develop.", "Indeed, there is a fairly well-established literature quantifying the boost to growth and productivity which arises from financial depth, especially for developing countries (Levine et al (2000)).", "Latterly, however, the question has been asked whether it is possible to have too much of a good thing.", "Some have asked why the cost of financial intermediation continues to rise and what this might signal about the efficiency of financial services as an industry (Friedman (2009), Philippon (2015)).", "Others have pointed to a possible U-shaped relationship between measures of financial depth and productivity and growth (Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012), Heil (2017)).", "These questions have an important bearing on the contribution the financial system makes to the economy and to society.", "They are also meta-questions for regulatory policy.", "(i) Financial Stability Implications of FinTech: Technologically-enabled innovation in financial services, or FinTech, has grown rapidly in recent years.", "The FSB's recent report contains a useful taxonomy of such innovations (FSB (2017f)).", "With this development comes the promise of greater consumer choice, improved access to credit for some borrowers, and greater efficiency and productivity in the traditional intermediary sector.", "There are also potential resilience benefits from increasing diversity in the provision of financial services (Carney (2017a)).", "While the sector is probably too small at present to pose a threat to financial stability, there is ample historical experience of risks emerging rapidly in fast-growing sectors if left unchecked.", "Such future risks might include: conventional vulnerabilities associated with excessive use of leverage and maturity, liquidity and credit transformation; the emergence of new highly-interconnected entities; and cyber and other operational risks.", "There is also the potential for these developments to make traditional universal banks less resilient, if they are forced to rely on less stable funding sources, for example.", "A challenge for policymakers is to ensure that the regulatory regime, and the wider policy framework including the scope of central banks' liquidity facilities - adapts to keep pace with these developments (Lagarde (2017)).", "Notes: 'Continuation of trend is a pre-crisis' simple extrapolation of GDP beyond 2007 using the average
