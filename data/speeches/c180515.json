but only if the right conditions are in place.", "Agents and takaful operators need to work hand in hand to develop a comprehensive ecosystem catering to all segments of customers, whether online or off-line - or in marketing speak, an \"omnichannel\" approach.", "While it is imperative that takaful operators seek to provide as seamless an experience as possible in terms of online content for consumers, this does not have to lead to the substitution of agents.", "Agents can in fact enrich the process by being trained and equipped with useful tools to guide and advise potential customers.", "Agents should also work with aggregators as a means to develop an online presence, in the same way real estate agents are featured on property websites.", "It is important to note, however, that technology is only a platform, a tool.", "Without strategy or purpose, the adoption of tech alone cannot spur change.", "What is needed to complement this is a fresh approach to business.", "This means broadening one's horizons beyond given market conventions, and being courageous to compete in new, unexplored strategic areas.", "Compete better - and more broadly To truly capture the market of the future, agents will need to sharpen their competitive edge.", "There are many ways to go about this, but I'd like to talk about two in particular: Doing what you already do better, and doing it for a much broader market.", "Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, once said about his company's products -

three in four agents were found to have failed to complete a comprehensive fact-finding process for more than 80% of their customers.", "This may be a symptom of a product-pushing mentality at the expense of customer welfare.", "The lack of objectivity increases the risk of unsuitable products being sold to customers, and could well permanently taint the industry's reputation in the long-run.", "Things can, and must be done better.", "With the new Balanced Scorecard developed in consultation with the industry - including NAMLIFA, the incentive structure has been improved so that agents work more effectively and objectively in the best interest of their customers.", "The Scorecard also reinforces our vision for agents to move towards higher value-add activities that involve advice, sales and customer support for more complex products.", "Another aspect that takaful agents must recognise is that takaful products embody universal value propositions that would appeal to all market segments, whether Muslim or not.", "One of the more distinct features of takaful is the distribution of surplus to takaful participants, reflecting the principles of solidarity, risk-sharing and mutuality among takaful participants.", "The outcome of this are not just socially meaningful products, but also commercially competitive ones.", "Take a motor takaful product as an example: In addition to the 'No Claim Bonus' feature that is common in conventional motor insurance, takaful participants could receive additional financial benefits when the takaful fund performs well through the sharing of surplus.", "Often, the advantages of the takaful products are not sufficiently highlighted, potentially hampering the competitiveness of takaful products The key is to continuously espouse the value propositions of takaful products.", "This is an aspect that agents could certainly help to address.", "The market potential for takaful products is so much larger than what is realised today.", "Let me offer you two key information.", "As at end-2016, insurance and takaful penetration in the B40 segment of working age stood at 30.3%, compared with the overall penetration rate of 46.8%.", "Second, the global Halal industry is worth USD2 trillion annually and Malaysia has a large and growing Halal industry.", "The question is to what extent the takaful industry fulfills the insurance needs of the Halal businesses.", "Takaful agents can play a key role in reaching out to this broader market, particularly by understanding the takaful products, and being able to explain them simply without diluting the distinct value propositions of takaful.", "Part of this will require greater acumen and empathy on the part of agents for the diverse needs and preferences of customers from all walks of life.", "But it is also about developing long-term strategic value: By being well-versed in both fields, agents stand to position themselves as an authoritative voice in advising both takaful operators and insurance firms in relation to the changing trends in the demands and needs of consumers and product features that would better cater to these.", "Embody what you sell I've spoken at length about the tools and methods that can help sharpen the niche of takaful agents as they enter a new, potentially disruptive phase in the industry's development.", "But my final point makes a recourse back to unchanging core of this profession: In particular, the values embodied by takaful.", "The very existence of this industry rests on the ultimate objective of attaining the well-being of mankind as called for in Islam.", "Takaful agents, being an essential part of this ecosystem, must embody their role as 'wakeel' of takaful to the highest standards.", "Trust, honesty and fairness are values that I am sure everyone in this room seeks to exemplify in all their dealings with customers.", "In a few months' time, the Bank will be issuing an Exposure Draft on Fair Treatment of Financial Consumers which will set out heightened regulatory expectations for all players.", "Agents will need to exercise greater care, skill and diligence in their dealing with customers.", "But rules and regulations are in themselves not sufficient to create a pool of agents trusted by customers: That would require all-round, holistic professionalism - an agent who is technically qualified, fully committed and uncompromising on ethical standards.", "To me, it is this integrity and calibre that will ultimately guarantee the continued success of agents into the next decade, more so than any other factor.", "Faced with a more demanding and complex business environment, agents must continuously develop and equip themselves with skills and knowledge that are relevant, and that will continue to remain relevant well into the future.", "There are plenty of formal programmes available to help agents progress in their technical competencies.", "There is also a whole host of open online courses which can be accessed anytime, anywhere, with the desire to learn is the only prerequisite.", "It is encouraging that various professional training courses are already being offered through NAMLIFA's Financial and Life Practitioners Council, and that one of the programmes has been accredited by the Financial Accreditation Agency (FAA).", "Going forward, I hope that we will see more industry-driven standards and protocols that will assure customers that they can only expect consistent, top-notch quality service from their agents -
