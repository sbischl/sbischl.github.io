remained virtually unchanged.", "This reflects the moderate improvement in overall domestic supply and demand conditions.", "The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices are narrowing steadily on the whole, partly owing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions, particularly for real estate rents and information services, although leasing charges continue to decline.",
