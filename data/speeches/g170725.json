but there has been considerable progress in terms of financial regulation.", "Thanks to international cooperation between the 20 major economies, the resilience of the global financial system has significantly improved in eight years, without impeding the financing of the economy or global economic growth.", "We can all be proud of these achievements, but there is no room for complacency today.", "Let me elaborate on what I see as the three priorities for further work, and the two requirements to consolidate what we have achieved so far.", "Three priority areas where further work is needed.", "First, we have to \"without further significantly increasing overall finalise the Basel III framework, capital requirements across the banking sector, while promoting a level playing field\".", "I wish to stress that this commitment was reaffirmed in Hamburg a few days ago by the whole G20, including the United States and this is important as we need to preserve, in the words of the G20 Leaders' Declaration, \"an open and resilient financial system, grounded in agreed standards\"i.", "Regarding Basel III, I sincerely hope that we can reach a balanced agreement among Basel Committee members by next autumn.", "The vast majority of the Basel III framework has indeed already been agreed and is now largely implemented, notably in Europe since 2014 with the CRD IV package.", "The main outstanding point of discussion is, as you know, the so-called \"output floor\" which would apply to banks using internal models.", "The objective of Basel III is to lay the foundations for a strong, balanced and risk-sensitive international regulation, while reducing the undue variability of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).", "So we need a prudent but a reasonable level of the output floor, combined with strengthened supervision of banks' internal models and Europeans made sensible proposals to achieve this.", "But should the output floor be set at too high a level, the consequences in terms of the reduction of risk sensitivity and the increase in capital requirements would be unacceptable: for example, a 75% output floor would result in creating a \"Basel IV\" framework based affect half of international banks.", "It would de facto on the standardised approach.", "The output floor is to serve as a backstop, not as the primary driver of capital requirements: yes to Basel III, no to Basel IV.", "Having said that, the main issue now is no longer the solvency of banks, but the liquidity of non-banks.", "Therefore the bulk of the regulatory efforts must now be focused on the shadow banking system, which has risen from USD 73 trillion of assets in 2007 to USD 92 trillion in 2015ii i.e.", "150% of total GDP in the jurisdictions monitored by the Financial Stability Board.", "And those parts of shadow banking that may pose financial stability risks represent USD 34 trillion;
