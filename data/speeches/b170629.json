Costs: Costs of cross-border financial transactions are still relatively high in This is especially true for low value transactions and cross-border remittances, the GMS.", "where fees can be as high

increasing cross-border trade and investment call for mainly provided by local players.", "broadening cross-border players.", "As a result, the Bank of Thailand, together with other central banks in the region are working towards establishing a cross-border banking network through the so-called framework, which will facilitate Qualified ASEAN Bank or QAB qualified banks in ASEAN to increase their presence in another country.", "The expansion of banking presence through this framework will help increase coverage and service efficiency that are needed for economic integration.", "The Bank of
