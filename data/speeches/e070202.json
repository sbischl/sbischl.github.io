there is a high level of confidence and trust generally placed by the public in banks; and the strong preference among consumers for insurance products with a high savings content that enhances the complementary elements of insurance and banking products.", "This development provides significant competitive advantages for financial institutions and insurance companies which have partnered and adopted an integrated approach to market their financial products by leveraging significantly on the banking network.", "With close to 3200 bank branches located throughout the country, the banks' customer base constitutes a significant market potential.", "Furthermore, the insurance and takaful penetration ratio is currently only at 44% of the Malaysian population.", "In this regard, there is huge potential that is left remaining untapped.", "Despite the tremendous benefits that can be reaped from bancassurance, this opportunity, however, has not yet been fully harnessed.", "To date, an estimate of only less than 8% of Malaysian banking customers have relationships that include insurance products and services.", "Even though growth of bancassurance registered an encouraging trend, it is only driven by a small number of banking groups.", "In view of the high success penetration rate of bancassurance service providers and the fact that bank backed insurance companies have ready pool of the banking customers within the group to tap, they should seriously explore the bancassurance route to exploit the effectiveness of bancassurance to gain new market share.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am confident that the commitment of Axa Affin's foreign partner to introduce its best practices in Malaysia and its strategy to \"Think Global Act Local\" in terms of product innovation, operational and distribution strategy will go a long way towards ensuring the success of this new business venture, founded on the sound relationship they have nurtured via the general insurance entity, i.e.", "Axa Affin Assurance Berhad.", "This would also contribute to the development of the industry through the transfer of expertise, providing leadership in innovation and expanding the range of quality products and services available to Malaysian consumers.", "Having such strategic partnerships which allows equity participation from international players of up to 49% under BNM new liberalized operating environment would enable insurers to leverage on the experience and financial capabilities of the foreign partner and this would allow them to grow in size.", "They would also have the capacity to improve their competitiveness and enter into foreign markets, taking more complex risks and expand their product portfolio more significantly.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, On the regulatory front, allow me to share with you what the future holds for the regulatory developments that would predominantly shape the future direction of the life insurance industry.", "The Bank's future regulatory orientation will be characterized by a heightened focus on, and alignment, with risk; anticipatory, rather than reactionary interventions; a clear goal to promote efficiency, innovation and competition by ensuring that regulation is proportionate in relation to its costs and benefits;
