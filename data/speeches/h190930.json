{"sentences": ["Insurance Ireland - PwC CEO Survey Report Breakfast Brieng - Deputy Governor Ed Sibley 27 September 2019 Speech Address at the Insurance Ireland - PwC CEO Survey Report Breakfast Brieng Introductory remarks Good morning ladies and gentlemen.", "I am pleased to be here this morning, and would like to thank Insurance Ireland and PwC for inviting me to speak to you all today.", "The Insurance Ireland / PwC CEO Survey, published today, contains some interesting insights, including the resilience of CEO optimism about the future, some of the challenges the industry faces and the potential disruption from innovation.", "In my last speech[2] on insurance, I focused primarily on the current functioning of the insurance market in Ireland, so today I will take my lead from the survey and focus my remarks on the future and on areas that I believe warrant your attention over the short and longer term.", "Specically, I will: urge you to continue to prepare for the plausible scenario of UK leaving the European Union without a deal; highlight that the insurance industry is arguably the most exposed nancial services sector to the risks, challenges and opportunities of innovation, climate change and demographic developments, and needs to be taking action now to meet these challenges successfully; update you on the Central Bank of Ireland's (the 'Central Bank') increased focus on recovery and resolution planning; and outline the work that we are doing to drive the insurance industry to address its disappointing lack of progress in improving diversity at senior levels.", "The economic, political and societal risks to Ireland arising from the UK leaving the EU without a deal (a 'hard' Brexit) are well documented and so I will not repeat them here, beyond stating they are clearly material to the Irish nancial services sector, over both the short-term (cliff-edge) and the longer term.", "Based on the work we have undertaken in the Central Bank, the work of the Oireachtas, the actions taken by the European Commission and the work in individual rms, I am satised that the Irish nancial system as a whole is sufciently resilient to withstand a hard Brexit.", "That is not to say that it will be unscathed, as it and consumers of nancial services clearly will be negatively affected.", "Frictions will inevitably arise.", "However, the system as a whole should not amplify the shock and will continue to be able to serve the economy, consumers and investors afterwards.", "Nonetheless, it is also true to say that not all regulated nancial services rms are adequately prepared.", "There is no excuse for this, even accepting that there remains considerable uncertainty as to what will happen at the end of October and thereafter.", "So, I continue to urge you to make sure your rms are prepared - to make sure that Brexit fatigue and uncertainty does not lead to risks not being sufciently mitigated.", "It is critical that regulated rms have considered all the impacts that Brexit could have on their businesses and that they have developed and fully tested their contingency plans in respect of these.", "You owe all your stakeholders, including most importantly your customers, a duty of care to ensure that you are prepared.", "I noted with interest the questions and responses in the survey on regulatory competition and the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for UK rms seeking alternative EU locations.", "There are many reasons that Ireland is an attractive location for internationally active nancial services rms.", "Regulatory arbitrage is not one of them.", "Numerous international studies[3] and our own experience in Ireland[4] demonstrate the folly of seeking for it to be so.", "The Central Bank continues to be successful in seeking to operate to and inuence the European norms of regulation and supervision.", "We have discharged our gatekeeping function effectively, pragmatically and transparently and in line with these European standards.", "We have robustly challenged rms to make sure that they have sufcient nancial and human resources, are well governed and have business models that are likely to be sustainable through the economic cycle.", "As a result of Brexit, more than 100 rms have been newly authorised or approved to signicantly expand their operations having met our expectations.", "Our approach not only delivers on our mandate of safeguarding nancial stability and protecting consumers and investors.", "It also helps to ensure that there is substance in these rms and that consumers across Europe can have the same levels of condence in the products and services sold from Ireland, as those originated elsewhere - that they are regulated and supervised to the same standard.", "The long term success of the Irish nancial system depends on its reputation, on the trust and condence in both the rms and the regulatory environment.", "This has long been the case.", "It is even more important now in the context of Brexit.", "We live in an era of continued change and uncertainty.", "The insurance industry will be signicantly affected by two of the dening developments of this era - technology change and climate breakdown.", "These developments present both signicant risks and opportunities for the sector and individual rms and there are likely to be winners and losers.", "Taking each in turn: Technology change The survey results highlight the importance and opportunities of innovation.", "It shows that the majority of respondents are planning for greater use of automation and the increasing importance of data analytics.", "Technology changes will affect both how insurance is offered, and what is insured.", "Investment in talent and technology is therefore critical to ensure your rms are able to anticipate and keep pace with these changes.", "History is littered with failed rms and, in some cases, industries that did not.", "But you also need to ensure that your foundations are solid.", "Too many of your rms are not getting the fundamentals right[5], with ineffective IT risk management practices, weaknesses in IT security, a lack of effective oversight of IT, and weaknesses in the management of outsourcing[6].", "You run the risk that the investment in the new is being built on the sand of a lack of resilience in the old.", "Our continuing expectation is that the Boards and Senior Management of regulated rms fully recognise their responsibilities in relation to IT and cybersecurity governance and risk management and place these among their top priorities.", "Moreover, the increasing use of technology and data analytics to understand and inuence customer behaviour raises important ethical and cultural questions regarding the use of this data and the signicant asymmetry of information between rms and their customers.", "The survey highlights that only 22% of respondents believe that the industry has sufciently responded to changing consumer habits.", "I am concerned that even fewer of you and your boards have adequately considered the ethics of how data and technology are increasingly being used in your key interactions with your customers, and are ensuring that this is being done in consumer centric way, consistent with your stated values and branding.", "The insurance industry is materially exposed to climate change.", "Physical risks will impact liabilities (including the costs of claims) and assets; and transition risks could be extremely costly on the investment side.", "Since the 1980s the number of registered weather-related loss events has tripled, and ination-adjusted insurance losses from these events have increased ve-fold in the same period.", "In addition, transition to a low carbon economy also presents risks, particularly if disinvestment from carbon intensive activities occurs in a disorderly manner.", "According to analysis by EIOPA, roughly 13% or \u20ac1.4trn ($1.6trn) of European insurers' \u20ac10.6trn of assets are exposed to climate transition risk[8] - i.e.", "the change in asset values that might occur in the shift to a low-carbon economy.", "\"The providers of capital - banks, insurers, asset managers and those who supervise them - all need to improve their understanding and management of climate-related nancial risks.... Firms that align their business models to the transition to a net zero world will be rewarded handsomely.", "Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.", "\"[9] Moreover, as my colleague Sharon Donnery recently highlighted[10], with climate change, the past is unlikely to be a good guide to the future - catastrophes are getting harder to predict in terms of frequency and impact but it is clear that both frequency and impact are increasing materially.", "The dynamics of climate change present a major challenge to modelling future impacts[11], but it is clear that the worst possible year is getting worse every year.", "There is also a very real risk of a collective withdrawal of insurers from covering risks that they consider uninsurable.", "The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) shows that the insurance 'protection gap' for weather related losses is already signicant, with roughly 70 per cent of losses uninsured in .", "As outlined in a recent Economist article, the worst case is that \"swathes of the global economy become uninsurable\"[13].", "In some jurisdictions, such as the UK, this has prompted the state and insurance rms to work together to supply affordable insurance for homes that are at high risk of ooding.", "It is clear that, as The Network for Greening the Financial System[14] has highlighted, climate related risks are a source of nancial risk, particularly to the insurance sector.", "This is why the Central Bank has joined the NGFS and is committed to its aims, including assessing climate related nancial risks in the nancial system and integrating them into prudential supervision.", "As well as risk, there is an opportunity for the insurance industry to play a positive and proactive role in shaping the wider response to the climate change risks.", "After all, insurance, at its core, is about quantifying the nancial impact of uncertain future events: just as the rst underwriters in Lloyd's coffee house understood the impact that storms would have on the loss of ships in the 18th century[15] so today's underwriters, actuaries and risk managers must understand the impact of our changing climate, albeit with much more sophisticated data and models to meet these challenges.", "The Central Bank expects Irish insurance undertakings to give full consideration to assessing climate related risks and to adopt a longer-term perspective.", "Risk management frameworks, and rms' ORSAs[16] in particular, should reect these considerations, including taking a prudent approach to the high degree of modelling uncertainty.", "We expect to see evidence of robust analysis, prudence and challenge, including from the board, and timely and effective action.", "In this context, I do recognise that some insurers have begun to consider the implications of the investment and underwriting[17] decisions for sustainability[18].", "Many more of you need to do likewise, and more besides.", "Recovery Planning and Resolution Turning now to a key regulatory development that will require you to take action.", "Failures of insurance rms can cause considerable stress and nancial loss for policyholders and claimants and nancial stability risks.", "But the Central Bank does not have a zero failure regulatory regime.", "It is important that rms can take risks otherwise they could not sustainably serve the needs of the economy or they customers, and it is inevitable that some will get into trouble as risks crystallise and a few will fail.", "In this context, the Central Bank aims for rms to be able to recover if they get into difculty and for them to resolvable in a manageable way if they cannot recover, minimising losses to policyholders and claimants and without recourse to state support.", "However, internationally and domestically, the insurance sector is not sufciently advanced in being able to mitigate the risks of these failures, both in relation to the regulatory framework and to rms' preparedness for crises.", "Recovery Planning Pre-emptive recovery planning is necessary to facilitate increased awareness and preparedness within rms.", "Adequate preparation and planning in the form of pre-emptive recovery planning will reduce both the probability of insurers failing and the impact of such failures.", "Recovery planning is, therefore, an important part of the overall risk management process of insurers and should be considered a governance arrangement within the meaning of the 2015 Regulations[19].", "While some rms articulate potential management actions in capital plans linked to their ORSA processes, these capital plans and related management actions are poorly developed and in the main they reect limited thinking around the practicalities of recovering from a severe stress event.", "Recovery plans should be pre-emptive and cover a wider range of scenarios (liquidity, solvency and operational) than those currently dealt with in ORSAs or required under Solvency II for SCR or MCR breaches[20].", "To be comprehensive, recovery plans need to address potentially less probable, but more severe stresses, they should contain full detail of \"triggers\" for implementation, escalation processes and recovery options to be taken in different crisis-scenarios and they should identify also potential nancial or operational impediments to recovery.", "The Bank expects rms to consider recovery planning as a key part of the strategy setting and capital planning and take action now to enhance their ability to recover should they get into difculty.", "With this in mind, the Bank plans to go to public consultation next year on proposals to introduce formal recovery planning requirements for insurers under Section of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.", "Resolution Planning The current powers available to the Central Bank to deal with insurer failures have signicant limitations.", "All three powers (administration, examinership and liquidation) are predominantly Court-controlled.", "Once the Central Bank has successfully petitioned the Court, it no longer has direct control over the process.", "The availability of other resolution tools, such as the ability to appoint a special manager, or the development of a new write-down and/or conversion (bail-in) power for the Central Bank could potentially better mitigate the impact of failure and cost to the public / policyholders, particularly for large, systemically important insurers.", "To this end, we will continue to engage domestically and at a European level to seek to develop an effective regime for resolving insurers.", "The need for a harmonized, Solvency II-linked approach to resolution is now widely recognised across Europe.", "The calls for such an approach have become pronounced as proposals for home-state managed insurance compensation schemes[22] gain ground in the EU.", "However, progress is slow and uncertain, hence the need to consider action at a domestic level, particularly in the context of the potential for considerable contingent liabilities for the Irish compensation scheme.", "The Central Bank will therefore continue to develop its own approach to resolving insurance rms and we will consider using the Central Bank's existing powers to seek to remove impediments to resolvability as necessary and in a proportionate way.", "This work will dovetail with the work we expect insurance rms to be undertaking on recovery planning.", "Diversity & inclusion The Central Bank is committed to driving improvements in the levels of diversity of senior managers in nancial services rm.", "This is based on the compelling evidence, including our own experience, that higher levels of diversity of experience, thought, background and attributes at senior levels and an inclusive environment in rms can meaningful contribute to: reducing the likelihood of groupthink in and across rms; reducing overcondence and improving decision-making; enhancing risk management; and increasing the level of internal challenge in rms and reducing excessive resistance to external challenge.", "Moreover, addressing the lack of diversity at a leadership level across the nancial services system will contribute to cultural change and evidence to your customers that this necessary change is meaningfully taking place.", "In March 2019, the Central Bank published its third annual report on the levels of diversity of the most senior appointments in the Irish nancial services sector[23].", "On both an absolute and comparative basis, there remains a concerning lack of gender diversity at senior levels in the insurance sector.", "In insurance, 22% of applications for approval for these most senior roles were for women, compared to 23% in 2017.", "In other words, the insurance industry went backwards in 2018.", "Applications for board positions in the banking sector increased to 36% in 2018, with insurance stuck at 20%.", "The analysis continues to show a pronounced gender imbalance at board level and in revenue generating roles.", "In the insurance sector, in revenue generating roles, the male to female ratio is currently 6:1 at directorship level (15% female representation).", "For risk management/ control roles, the male to female ratio is 4:1 (20% female representation).", "I recognise that meaningfully addressing such an entrenched issue cannot be achieved overnight.", "But that is not to say that the Central Bank is accepting of the lack of progress.", "So, as well as following up on the actions being taken in the banking sector following our Behaviour and Culture review last year[24] we are continuing to enhance our supervisory framework and approach to the supervision of behaviour and culture, including diversity and inclusion.", "To this end, the Central Bank is currently undertaking a review of the insurance sector, which we have prioritised due to the lack of progress and the associated risks in the sector.", "During this review, we: are assessing the diversity of the most senior role holders in 12 insurance rms, considering gender, nationality, education, experience and so on; are assessing the policies and initiatives being put in place by companies to improve diversity and inclusivity; and have also extended our analysis to examine companies' approaches to xed and variable remuneration, to assess incentivisation and the size of gender pay gaps within these insurance rms.", "As well as expecting individual rms to address any specic issues we identify, we will publish the overall outcome and themes arising from this review early in 2020.", "And, we will learn ourselves from completing the work and so continue to enhance our own approach to the supervision of behaviour and culture.", "Clearly, there is much for CEOs, Chairs and the Boards of insurance rms to focus on.", "Most importantly, you need to continue to improve the running of your businesses and not to lose sight of the fundamentals of effective governance, effective risk management, the adequacy of your resources, and the sustainability of your business models.", "These are the foundation of your future success, as you face into the considerable challenges ahead.", "To nish on a positive note, some might say that insurance is looking quite exciting and dynamic.", "Perhaps you could better use this excitement to attract, develop and promote more diverse leadership teams.", "Thank you for your attention.", "[1] With thanks to Brian
