increase gradually.", "With regard to exogenous demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to follow an upward trend due to steady developments in overseas economies, and public investment has started to pick up reflecting the progress in the implementation of the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999.", "As regards domestic private demand, housing investment is on a moderate

falling slowly.", "As for the outlook, upward pressure on prices is likely to arise from the gradual improvement in domestic supply-demand balance and from the rise in crude oil prices.", "On the other hand, downward pressure is expected from the long-term declining trend of machinery prices due to technological innovations and from the fall in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen.", "On balance, overall prices are likely to remain unchanged.", "However, attention should still be paid to the downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand, although
