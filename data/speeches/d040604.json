support, and is likely to continue.", "After all, the new Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, was the architect of the initial economic reforms in the early 1990s.", "He has appointed as Finance Minister Mr Chidambaram, who is also a reformist and a former Commerce Minister and Finance Minister.", "I am therefore hopeful that the thrust of liberalisation will continue, and India will play

fear of appearing pro American.", "This is a serious problem that has not yet been adequately addressed.", "One important question is the role of Islam in Southeast Asian countries.", "Traditional Southeast Asian Islam is syncretic and tolerant, but it is increasingly influenced by more austere Middle Eastern variants of Islam, especially Wahhabbism.", "Which way this battle for the soul of Islam goes is a key uncertainty that will determine the future of the region.", "In Malaysia, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi won a clear victory over PAS, the opposition Islamist Party.", "He did not challenge PAS' contention that Malaysia should be an Islamic State, but instead fought PAS on what kind of Islamic State Malaysia should be.", "His victory bolsters his vision of progressive Islam and should encourage mainstream Muslims everywhere.", "But PAS will not give up and is girding itself for a long-term struggle.", "In Indonesia, it is significant that all three major Presidential candidates are secular nationalists.", "But all three have also found it necessary to seek Vice Presidential candidates with strong Muslim credentials, and support from Muslim parties.", "Although Indonesia has a long history of tolerant, syncretic Islam, more so than other Southeast Asian countries, political Islam is now at the centre of Indonesian politics and a crucial swing factor.", "In Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin's pro business and pro growth economic policies have not found resonance in the Muslim south.", "The recent upsurge of Islamic separatist violence is worrying, though there is so far no evidence of international terrorist connections.", "Southeast Asian governments, even those with large Muslim populations, are secular, moderate and intent on economic growth.", "If progressive and moderate forces are to win the global battle for the hearts and minds of the Muslims, Southeast Asia is perhaps the most favourable battleground.", "Riding on Asia's growth This backdrop gives hope that the strategic and security environment in Asia will remain stable.", "I am also optimistic that Asian countries will continue to maintain stable political environments, pursue pro-business economic policies, and participate in the global economy.", "One significant economic issue countries must tackle is to strengthen and develop their financial sectors.", "Asian countries need a two-pronged approach to do this.", "First, they should foster greater regional cooperation in financial markets to leverage on their collective strength.", "Second, individual countries need to press on with unfinished financial reforms and take judicious steps to liberalise the financial sector.", "Greater regional cooperation On regional cooperation, countries have clearly recognised the benefits of greater trade integration, driven by the forces of globalisation.", "To facilitate the integration process, ASEAN has accelerated the timetable for the formation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area.", "Last October, the leaders decided to commit to creating an ASEAN Economic Community, giving for the first time a supranational cast to ASEAN's aspirations.", "The ASEAN+3 process that links ASEAN with China, Japan and South Korea, ought eventually to evolve into an East Asian Economic Community that may include Australia and New Zealand.", "ASEAN is also negotiating free trade agreements with key trading partners.", "In addition to a Comprehensive Economic Partnership with Japan, ASEAN has targeted FTAs with China and India by the end of this decade.", "Meanwhile, individual ASEAN countries are already concluding FTAs with China, India and Japan.", "More recently, regional countries have also embarked on various initiatives to deepen capital market cooperation and integration in the region.", "For example, the EMEAP Group, comprising 11 central banks and monetary authorities in the East Asia and Pacific region, has launched the Asian Bond Fund I.", "The group is now working towards launching the local currency-denominated Asian Bond Fund 2.", "The ASEAN+3 member countries have also made significant progress to develop regional bond markets under the Asian Bond Market Initiative and to establish a regional financing arrangement through the Chiang Mai Initiative.", "These initiatives are significant not only for their tangible economic benefits, but also as symbolic demonstrations of the collective interest in regional financial cooperation.", "Alliances among Asian exchanges Another area with potential for regional financial collaboration is in the securities and futures exchanges market.", "In US and especially in Europe, a wave of consolidation among leading exchanges has resulted in mega-exchanges that have the economies of scale to make investments in advanced infrastructure, offer competitive fees, and most importantly provide investors and issuers with the liquidity that they seek.", "Exchanges in Asia have thus far been largely insulated from the trends of consolidation.", "Asian stock markets are generally smaller in size and less liquid than those in more developed countries.", "To remain relevant to international investors in this changing landscape, regional exchanges should deepen their collaboration with one another.", "The decision of the recent ASEAN Finance Ministers' meeting to explore alliances and linkages among ASEAN securities markets will catalyse and encourage this collaboration.", "Regional exchanges are already taking the first steps.", "The Singapore Exchange, SGX, for instance, established a co-trading linkage with the Australian Stock Exchange in 2001.", "It is in discussions with Tokyo Stock Exchange on a possible alliance, and has recently started talks with Bursa Malaysia, formerly the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, on possible collaborations.", "Pressing on with reforms at the national level While pursuing regional initiatives, individual countries need to press on with reforms at the national level.", "Although many Asian countries have significantly strengthened their financial systems, they still need to follow through with reforms in the financial and corporate sectors.", "Singapore's financial system was lucky to emerge from the Asian crisis relatively unscathed.", "During the crisis, we undertook an extensive liberalisation program aimed at deepening and broadening capital markets, consolidating and upgrading the local banks, and enhancing Singapore's position as an international financial centre.", "At the same time, we put in place a new supervisory framework to oversee financial institutions, shifting from one-size-fits-all regulation to more risk-based supervision.", "Our efforts have achieved encouraging results.", "Our debt market has grown three-fold since 1998 to reach S$90 billion in 2002, driven by growing demand in the region for debt financing.", "Our wealth management industry more than doubled in the same period, with total Assets Under Management growing from S$150 billion in 1998 to S$344 billion in 2002.", "In treasury activities, we have maintained our position as the fourth largest FX centre in the world, with an average daily trading volume of US$119 billion in 2003.", "The local banks have consolidated from seven into three banks that are larger and stronger, and are building up their regional footprints.", "In the recent Financial System Stability Assessment of Singapore, the IMF affirmed the robustness of Singapore's financial system and the soundness of our legal, supervisory and institutional framework.", "We are heartened by these outcomes.", "But we still need to press on with further reforms and policy adjustments, because the international financial landscape continues to evolve.", "In this regard, let me highlight two things that MAS is doing.", "Revisions to capital adequacy requirements of locally incorporated banks First, MAS will be revising the capital adequacy requirements of locally incorporated banks.", "Singapore banks have since 1992 been required to meet a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio, or CAR, requirement of 12%.", "MAS has progressively adjusted this requirement.", "However, the current MAS requirement of 12% Total CAR of which 8% must be Tier 1 capital still exceeds those in other major financial centres.", "As part of MAS' efforts to keep our regulatory framework up-to-date with international best practices, we started to review the CAR requirements in March last year.", "I am sure the industry will be pleased to know that MAS has completed the review.", "MAS will announce the details at a press conference tomorrow evening.", "I will touch briefly on the three components of the revisions.", "The first change is in the minimum CAR requirements of local banks.", "MAS will lower this minimum CAR to 10%, of which at least 7% should comprise Tier 1 capital.", "This is competitive, taking into account our small and open economy, and the systemic importance of the three local banks.", "Some other countries, including Switzerland, similarly have a higher requirement than other developed jurisdictions.", "This reduction in minimum CAR does not necessarily translate into a full 2% lowering of the total CAR requirements because in parallel with this, MAS will amend the rules for computing CAR, which is the second component of the package of CAR revisions.", "(ii) Changes in CAR computation rules One noteworthy revision to the computation rules will be a requirement for banks to set aside more capital for significant investments, commensurate with the risks associated with such investments.", "We had stated in August last year that this would be done, when we extended by two years the grace period for Singapore banks to divest non-financial businesses.", "Another significant revision is to allow banks to include 45% of the revaluation surpluses from banks' holdings of property assets as well as portfolio equity investments as Upper Tier 2 capital.", "This will raise the capital available to banks, but it is unlikely to offset the higher capital that they will have to set aside for significant investments.", "In line with the policy of setting more transparent requirements, MAS will publish these CAR requirements and computation rules.", "Local banks will report their CAR based on the revised rules starting from their second quarter financial results.", "(iii) Bank specific supervisory CAR requirements.", "The third component is supervisory CAR.", "Like other supervisors, MAS may impose additional bank-specific supervisory CAR to address risks not adequately covered by the minimum requirement.", "MAS has refined the framework for setting these supervisory CAR add-ons.", "It takes advantage of MAS' existing risk-based supervisory approach and is based on MAS' risk assessment of individual banks.", "In line with international practice, these supervisory CAR add-ons will be kept confidential.", "Impact of the revisions The adjustments in our CAR framework will allow local banks to manage their capital more flexibly.", "Banks which have lower risk profiles and which are better managed will enjoy lower total regulatory CAR requirements than before.", "At the same time, the adjustments will maintain prudential standards observed by supervisors in other major financial centres, which tend to be more stringent than the minimum standards stipulated under the current Capital Accord.", "Overall, these changes will result in modest but meaningful reductions to the CAR requirements, but they may or may not translate into immediate capital reductions for the banks.", "Leading banks tend to maintain capital at levels well above regulatory minimums, and that will undoubtedly prove to be the case in Singapore as well.", "In managing their capital positions, banks will also take into account their future expansion plans, as well as the risks they potentially face in their business environment.", "Non-internationalisation of Singapore dolla (S$) policy The second policy adjustment concerns the non-internationalisation of Singapore dollar.", "Monetary policy in Singapore is centred on the management of the exchange rate.", "As an international financial centre with open capital markets, we are exposed to large and sometimes, volatile capital flows.", "To facilitate the effective conduct of our monetary policy and to avoid large swings in our S$ exchange rate, we have a policy of discouraging the internationalisation of the S$.", "However, we recognised that the trade-off was a less vibrant capital market, particularly the debt market.", "So we have progressively relaxed the specific restrictions over the past six years, while maintaining the intent of the policy.", "The results have been positive.", "The non-internationalisation policy is now down to two basic safeguards to discourage speculation in the S$ - banks may not lend S$ to non-resident financial institutions in order to speculate on the S$, and non-resident borrowers who raise S$ through bank borrowings or on our capital markets must swap or convert these S$ to foreign currencies before remitting them abroad.", "This stance remains appropriate, and continues to underpin the effective conduct of our monetary policy.", "Nevertheless, there is scope for further fine-tuning.", "We have decided that non-resident, non-financial issuers of S$ bonds and equities will no longer be required to swap or convert their S$ proceeds into foreign currencies before remitting abroad.", "Non-resident, financial issuers of bonds and equities will still have to do so.", "This will give the issuers greater flexibility in managing their S$ funds.", "In addition, MAS will exempt from the restrictions under the policy, any extension of temporary overdrafts of S$ vostro accounts to prevent settlement failures.", "This will facilitate straight-through processing and more efficient handling of S$ payments.", "With the progressive relaxation of the S$ restrictions, the current policy essentially limits only lending of S$ to non-resident financial institutions for the purpose of speculating in the S$, and does not specifically seek to prevent the internationalisation of the S$.", "The present label: \"Non-Internationalisation of the S$\" may suggest that Singapore restricts foreign participation in S$ markets, which we do not do.", "We have therefore also decided to rename the policy \"Lending of S$ to non-resident financial institutions\".", "Asia has had a remarkable recovery and can now look forward to a period of renewed growth and prosperity.", "Financial markets will play a major role in this process.", "Despite some strategic and security risks in the region, the political situation is generally stable and positive.", "There are challenges ahead, but with greater regional collaboration and integration, and continued reforms and developments to financial sectors in individual countries, Asians, and investors in the region, can look forward to a vibrant and dynamic future."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
