and were both the \"inevitable\" result of the QE conducted that year, as some have said?", "Second, how does the MPC take account of asset sales (\"QT\") in its economic forecasts - does that not require an additional and explicit estimate of its impact on activity and inflation?", "Given the extraordinarily high inflation we've been experiencing in the past couple of years, and the use of \"unconventional\" policy over the past decade or so, these are important and legitimate questions.", "That is my excuse, at least, for the inordinate length of this speech (for which I apologise).", "I have attempted to summarise the main points in this introduction.", "In some ways the opening question - should we think of monetary effects in terms of prices (interest rates and asset prices) or quantities (monetary aggregates) - draws the contrast between the two a little too starkly.", "They're not mutually exclusive.", "In the so-called \"IS-LM\" model, through which many people are introduced to macro-economics, a rise in the supply of money does eventually lead to a proportionate rise in consumer prices.", "It's just that it operates via interest rates.", "That's because, as long as people are free to borrow and lend, demand in these models is fully pinned down by current and (expected) future real interest rates.", "The expansionary effect of an injection of money therefore relies on its first depressing the yield curve and the stance of policy is fully captured by the prevailing level of interest rates (relative to some underlying, \"neutral\" level).", "If this core theory appears to favour prices over quantities then the data too would seem to lean in that direction - or, at least, to caution against too crude an interpretation of the monetary aggregates.", "History demonstrates that shifts in the quantity of money have often been driven - or at least accompanied - by shifts in the demand for deposits (i.e.", "what the private sector would like to hold for a given level of spending).", "Following the financial liberalisation earlier that decade, banks began during the 1980s to pay interest on standard deposit accounts.", "This increased their attractiveness, relative to other \"stores of wealth\" - they were not the precursor to higher spending and inflation - and broad growth remained stubbornly high even as inflation declined sharply (at least until the boom at the end of the decade).", "For similar reasons broad money growth was extremely strong throughout the first fifteen years of inflation targeting (1992-2007).", "Nor is there a tight correspondence between \"narrow\" and \"broad\" money.", "QE involves the creation of central bank reserves to buy financial assets (usually government debt).", "So in the decade or so that passed between the first use of the policy in 2009 and the onset of the pandemic, reserves grew extremely rapidly.", "Yet broad money growth was significantly slower than it had been before the crisis (Chart 1).", "And, in both periods, average inflation was close to 2% (Chart 2).", "Chart 1: Reserve creation neither necessary nor sufficient for strong growth of Sources: ONS, Bank of England and Bank calculations.", "Unless stated otherwise \"broad money\" refers to M4 excluding intermediate other financial corporations (M4ex).", "This is available from 1997 and projected backwards using aggregate M4 growth before then.", "Chart 2: Broad money growth slowed significantly after the financial crisis, inflation still close to 2% None of this means that at the margin (holding everything else fixed) QE doesn't add to broad money or ultimately to the level of prices.", "Nor does it imply that the quantity measures are never useful or important.", "It would be as wrong categorically to ignore monetary aggregates as it would to assume that they're the only thing you need to consider.", "As far as the theory's concerned, people can't always borrow and lend freely.", "In the presence of these and other \"financial frictions\" the availability of liquid assets can matter for spending, independently of interest rates.", "Besides, interest rates themselves matter only relative to some \"neutral\" rate that cannot be observed directly.", "So, in practice, monetary policymakers should always pay attention to other - indeed any - indicators of incipient inflationary pressure.", "And although changes in banks' deposits have often been driven by shifts in demand there are times when they look more supply-led.", "Arguably, the surge in broad money in 2020 looks like one such episode.", "Supported by the furlough scheme, and because their spending was held back by the lockdowns, households accumulated significant deposits during the pandemic (Chart 3).", "While not literally a \"helicopter drop\" this came quite close to an exogenous increase in the stock of household (and aggregate) money.", "Monetary authorities (including the MPC) certainly asked themselves at the time whether, independently of the level of the yield curve, the liquid nature of these assets would give a particular impetus to consumer spending once the lockdowns were lifted.", "Chart 3: Households accumulated significant deposits during pandemic However, what the history does demonstrate is movements in broad money can (and usually do) occur independently of developments in the size of the central bank's balance sheet.", "Commercial banks can create and withdraw deposits without any commensurate change in their reserve holdings at the central bank.", "If the jump in broad money during the pandemic really was the \"inevitable\" consequence of the QE at the time one presumably would expect to have seen the same after every preceding set of asset purchases.", "As Chart 2 illustrates that's not the case.", "And even if it looks more \"supply\" than \"demand\" led -

first the jumps in those of non-energy traded goods in 2021 and then, in 2022, the enormous rises in the costs of imported food and energy.", "The important point here is that, however you measure it - whether in terms of prices (interest rates) or quantities (monetary aggregates) - monetary policy operates with a lag.", "During that interval, and at least until policy can react to them, there are lots of things - \"shocks and disturbances\" (as the MPC's remit puts it) that can affect inflation.", "In this case it's clear what those have been: the hits to the supply of non-energy goods during the pandemic, to those of energy and food during the war, and the resulting rise in their global prices.", "Thanks to the significant hit to real incomes they involved, these shocks have also had sizeable second-round effects on domestic wages and prices.", "As an explanation for the inflation we've experienced I think this fits the actual data better than the single fact of strong household money growth during the pandemic.", "It's always possible, at least with the benefit of hindsight, to construct an alternative path for monetary policy over the past that would have kept inflation on target, even in the face of these subsequent shocks.", "But that's not the same thing as saying that the actual policy was \"inevitably\" going to result in excessive inflation.", "Simulations suggest that, had that alternative (much tighter) policy path been followed, and then had Russia failed to invade Ukraine, inflation would now be materially below target.", "Anyhow, what follows is a walk - rather a long walk, I'm afraid - through these various points.", "Less ink is spilled on the second question, concerning QT: should the MPC not include in its forecasts some identifiable and separate effects of asset sales on activity and inflation?", "Having argued that the policy is transmitted to demand and inflation largely via asset prices my answer to this will be \"no\".", "The Committee has said that the size of the Asset Purchase Facility (APF), the vehicle through which QE and QT are conducted) will be reduced gradually and predictably and, to that end, announced last September the exact planned reduction of the APF over the following twelve months.", "As such, it's reasonable to suppose that the impact of QT, even in prospect, is already captured in the prices of assets on which we condition our forecasts.", "To add something else would be to double-count the effect.", "Macro models and the determination of demand As an undergraduate one of the books I had to read was a collection of essays about monetary economics by one of my lecturers, Frank Hahn.", "It begins with this rather provocative sentence: \"The most serious challenge that the existence of money poses to the theorist is this: the best developed model of the economy cannot find room for it\".", "As a newcomer to the subject I found this a bit concerning (not to say alarming).", "If economics can't even say why money exists how can it hope to explain what it does?", "Reading on, one's concern subsided a bit.", "Hahn was, by training and inclination, a general equilibrium theorist.", "For him, as he explained in the very next sentence, \"the best developed model of the economy\" was the highly stylised description developed by the great economic theorists Ken Arrow and Gerard Debreu.", "For all its sophistication, the Arrow-Debreu model is one in which, by assumption, trade is entirely costless.", "In this perfect economy there's a market and a price for the exchange of any two goods or services - including those for future delivery - without the need for a medium of exchange or any sort of costly financial architecture.", "So it's not a huge surprise that, having ruled out at the start the conditions that might require it, this model should \"have no place\" for money.", "What Hahn's bit of rhetoric does suggest is that you need some sort of financial friction - some departure from the platonic realm of Arrow-Debreu - to explain why money might matter.", "Take, for example, the relationship that determines consumer spending in many models of the macroeconomy.", "Typically, this originates with a question: how would a forward-looking consumer, able to borrow and lend relatively freely, allocate his or her spending over time?", "After solving that stylised problem, and a bit of manipulation, you end up with something like this: Here, in what I've described rather grandly as equation [1], f(.)", "is some function of current and future (real) interest rates and the term in brackets is total wealth.", "Wealth has two components: net financial assets W (with an average real price p) and the present value of current and expected future labour income, or \"human wealth\" H. (In this set-up, greater \"consumer confidence\" can be thought of as a rise in those future expected incomes, and therefore this H term.)", "Higher real interest rates depress both p and H because they increase the rate at which future income is discounted.", "Because there's only one market here (in borrowing and lending) the demands of this set-up aren't quite as onerous as in Hahn's \"best developed model of the economy\", with its multiple barter exchanges.", "Nor do you have to assume that people can borrow and lend at precisely the same rate of interest (it does matter that they can do so at all).", "And in practice, estimated relationships of this sort have all sorts of dynamics within them - consumer spending won't adjust instantaneously to shifts in the right-hand-side variables - allowing the model to fit the data that much better.", "But the core relationship for consumption, in most macro models, will have something like [1] within it.", "And the important thing here, for our purposes, is that there's no identifiable and direct role for money.", "The same is true of the relationships used to model business investment.", "So at least according to this description, monetary policy affects demand (and thereby inflation) only to the extent it influences \"r\" or \"p\".", "You might think that there's another, more direct channel, via the wealth term \"W\".", "At least as far as their gross financial assets are concerned quite a bit of households' (and overall private-sector) wealth is held in the form of deposits in commercial banks.", "These also account for the vast majority of money in the economy (sometimes called \"broad money\").", "So wouldn't the creation of new deposits add directly to W and boost demand that way, even if there were no change in interest rates or asset prices?", "What one has to remember is that, for every pound of deposit liabilities, a bank has on the other side of its balance sheet a pound's worth of lending, or something like it: a matching obligation from the private sector to the bank.", "Indeed, it's precisely in the act of extending credit that a commercial bank typically creates \"new\" (broad) money[2].", "So, at least for the private sector as a whole, its interactions with the banking system -
