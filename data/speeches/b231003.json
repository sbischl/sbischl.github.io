how long it takes for past tightening to come into full effect.", "While these lags are difficult to estimate, I expect that the full effects of past tightening are yet to come in the months ahead.", "I strongly agree with what Chair Powell has said about where we are in the tightening cycle.", "Given how far we have come, we are now at a point where we can proceed carefully as we determine the extent of monetary policy restriction that is needed.", "In my view, the most important question at this point is not whether an additional rate increase is needed this year or not, but rather how long we will need to hold rates at a sufficiently restrictive level to achieve our goals.", "I expect it will take some time.", "I will continue to evaluate a range of incoming data as I make my assessments at upcoming meetings.", "As a part of this, I continue to track the cost and availability of credit to the economy, as I will discuss later in these remarks.", "Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Now let me turn to my focus today, which is the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability.", "Monetary policy affects the cost and quantity of credit in the economy, usually in a broad-based and gradual fashion.", "Financial instability, however, can affect the cost and quantity of credit in an acute and abrupt fashion.", "Both forces have an effect on economic activity, as the flow of credit to businesses and households is crucial for spending, hiring, and production, underpinning economic growth.", "Financial stability was a key motivation for the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.", "Although the term \"financial stability\" wasn't in the vernacular at the time, the Fed was established in part to provide \"an elastic currency\"-a major concern in an era when periodic strains in the banking sector resulted in currency hoarding and widespread bank runs and failures, causing severe harm to our economy.", "For much of our subsequent history, however, the Federal Reserve tended to consider financial stability and monetary policy separately.", "That perspective changed considerably in the years after the Global Financial Crisis, which had many implications for how we think ?", "As Paul Volcker put it 40 years ago when testifying as Federal Reserve Chair, \"the Federal Reserve, like any central bank, has a continuing and abiding interest in .", "the stability of the financial system in the broader sense.", "If you go back to history, that's really why the Federal Reserve was founded.\"", "See Paul Volcker (1983), \"Panel Discussion,\" in Problems, Options, and Issues Currently Facing the Financial Services Industry and the Agencies that Regulate and Supervise These Entities, hearing before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Apr.", "(Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 78.", "In addition, Robert Owen wrote, \"It is the duty of the United States to provide a means by which the periodic panics which shake the American Republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped.\"", "See Robert L.

resiliency of the banking system.", "Financial Stability Considerations in a Low-Rate Environment After the Global Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for years to revive a badly damaged economy.", "Researchers, market participants, and policymakers took note of the potential for very low interest rates to encourage investors to \"reach for yield\"-that is, to take increased risk in pursuing higher returns on their investments.", "This behavior can include taking on increased interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk.", "In some ways, investor reach for yield is an indication that monetary policy is helping stimulate economic activity.", "Lowering borrowing costs increases the expected return on any investment that is financed.", "This means that lower rates result in more investments or projects getting the green light.", "As a result, more people get jobs as economic activity increases.", "But in that environment of record low interest rates, and with the ravages of the financial crisis a fresh memory, people rightly wondered whether the incentive to reach for yield would drive excessive risk-taking, leading to a buildup in vulnerabilities that could ultimately threaten the stability of the financial system and the economy.", "Were those risks so considerable that financial stability concerns should be taken into consideration in making monetary policy decisions?", "* At the same time, some risks were 4 Michael Woodford raised the issue in 2012; see Michael Woodford (2012), \"Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability,\"\" NBER Working Paper Series 17967 (Cambridge, Mass.", ": National Bureau of Economic Research, April), .", "Among Fed policymakers, it was moving outside the banking system, leading some to worry that measures to build resilience at banks would miss these risks.", "Indeed, as then-Governor Jeremy Stein famously pointed out, monetary policy \"gets in all the cracks\" and therefore could push back against excessive risk-taking, not only in banks, but across the financial system.\u00b0 Despite these concerns, financial stability risks were contained until the pandemic.", "Financial Stability Consideration of Moving from Low Rates to Rising Rates The pandemic resulted in an unprecedented mismatch between demand and supply, both here and abroad, and these forces were the initial impetus for high inflation.", "The shift from an environment of generally low and slowly adjusting rates to the rapid and near-simultaneous tightening of monetary policy around the world that began last year set the stage for additional stresses in the financial system.", "For example, in the United Kingdom, an initial jump in the yields on longer-maturity government bonds was amplified by distress at liability-driven investment funds.", "These funds had become popular with many pension funds during the low-rate period and faced a liquidity squeeze, as they had to rapidly post collateral to cover derivatives losses.", "undertake a temporary and targeted program of purchases of long-dated government bonds.\u00b0 Here in the United States, starting in 2022, the FOMC began a period of rapid and substantial increases in the federal funds target range to combat inflation that was much too high.", "While most banks were well positioned to handle rate increases, higher interest rates had a severe effect on the balance sheets of banks that had not managed their interest rate risk appropriately.", "This mismanagement came into acute focus when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) announced it had realized a large loss from the sale of securities that had declined in value and that it intended to raise capital to fill that hole.", "Uninsured depositors abruptly ran on the bank-with actual and planned flight totaling roughly 85 percent of its deposits within 24 hours-and it failed instantly.", "SVB's failure caused widespread contagion that led quickly to the failure of Signature Bank and eventually to the failure of First Republic Bank, and it posed acute stress on other banks.", "The stress only abated after invocation of the systemic risk exception that permitted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect all depositors (including uninsured depositors) of the failed banks and the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) using the Fed's emergency lending authorities.", "The BTFP allowed banks to get access to Fed liquidity based on the par value of their high-quality securities at fixed rates for up to a year.", "This response helped calm conditions in the banking sector.", "Deposit flows returned to normal, and the prospect of a widespread and acute bank credit contraction 6 See Bank of England (2022), Financial Stability Report (London: BOE, December), .", "bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability-report/2022/financial-stability- report-december-2022.pdf.", "Such a contraction could well have harmed the economy and even triggered a recession.", "Indeed, one recent study looked at data for 46 countries over 150 years and found that episodes of bank stress are frequently followed by significant drops in bank lending and economic activity that persist for many years.'", "Despite the effectiveness of our response to the March stress events, the question again arose whether monetary policy goals were in conflict with financial stability.", "Given these historical experiences, I think it is particularly important that we watch closely how both monetary policy and the effects of the March banking stress are affecting bank behavior and the provision of credit to the economy.", "Recent data are consistent with pressures on banks easing relative to March.", "Nevertheless, although deposit volatility has abated, some banks have had to turn to higher-cost funding sources to make up for lost deposits.", "And core loan growth appears to be relatively stagnant in banks of all sizes.", "While low loan growth can be explained in part by weaker demand for loans in response to higher costs of credit, it is also driven in part by banks tightening their standards, as they reported they were doing in the past several releases of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.\u00ae As we continue to track developments, we are also continuing to learn from this episode.", "As I have discussed in other remarks, as well as in congressional testimony, we are using lessons learned from the March episode to consider how we can both enhance our supervision and adjust our regulations as appropriate to address risks at the institutions over which we have supervisory and regulatory authority.", "7 See Matthew Baron, Emil Verner, and Wei Xiong (2021), \"Banking Crises without Panics,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol.", "8 The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey is available on the Federal Reserve's website at A stable financial system is a necessary condition for sustainably achieving the FOMC's monetary policy goals of maximum employment and stable prices.", "It is critical that banks have enough capital to remain resilient to those stresses.", "The safety and soundness of the banking sector is paramount in achieving both our monetary policy and financial stability goals.", "Everyone in America depends on a safe and stable financial system that channels credit to businesses so they can grow and hire workers, and to households so they can deal with the ups and downs in the economy and invest in the future.", "Of course, major portions of the financial sector are not subject to federal prudential regulation.", "As I noted in a speech on bank capital earlier this year, we also need to worry about how risk outside the banking sector can threaten financial stability, as stress in broader financial markets is often transmitted to the banking system.\"", "So we need to take a broad view of financial stability.", "Perspectives from the Literature and the Policy Debate Recent experience lines up with academic research.", "I see three basic findings.", "'\u00b0 First, when financial intermediaries, such as banks, play the important role of channeling funds from savers to borrowers, they frequently do so through various forms of maturity and credit transformation.", "This transformation results in the creation of risk on their balance sheets.",
