banking institution in Seychelles.", "The Seychelles Monetary Authority, the precursor to the Central Bank of Seychelles, was established a mere two years after Seychelles gained its independence.", "This was the ultimate act that validated us as a sovereign state, with the ability to issue currency, manage our reserves, inspect banks and financial institutions and perhaps most importantly, set our own monetary policy objectives.", "Fast forward forty years, and we are proud to say that we have achieved a lot in a relatively short space of time.", "Through various technical assistance,

history.", "In a mere ten years, we have steered clear of that crisis and have become one of the success stories not only in our region, but in the world.", "Nevertheless, we do not allow ourselves to

expectations and to keep abreast with innovation in the financial sector.", "It is of utmost importance that as a Central Bank, we modernize the way we deliver our mandate and ensure that we provide
