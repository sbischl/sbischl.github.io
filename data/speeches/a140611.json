professional development milestones.", "Let me go on to the fifth capability that I mentioned earlier, which is leadership in finance.", "We want to develop Singaporeans for positions of leadership in tomorrow's financial world.", "It requires both depth and breadth, and will increasingly require both local and global experience and know-how.", "MAS already has several initiatives in place to further this objective, including the Finance Scholarship Programme and the Finance Associate Management Scheme (FAMS) for Singaporeans early in their finance careers2, as well as the International
