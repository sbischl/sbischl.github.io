trends in ageing and in economic growth, I think we have to live with the fact of low real interest rates for many years to come.", "It will pose a challenge for retirement security, and especially for pension funds and insurance funds.", "As you know, it hits you on both your assets and your liabilities.", "It means a lower return on your assets.", "And it pushes up the value of liabilities because the discount rates has gone down.", "It is not a temporary challenge but a long term challenge.", "As life expectancy goes up, liabilities will be pushed out further, and the gap in maturity between your liabilities and your assets is likely to grow.", "This mismatch in durations, together with low interest rates, means we have a growing problem.", "We cannot address this fundamentally through changes in asset allocation strategy among insurance and pension funds, taken as a whole.", "There have been recent shifts towards alternative assets.", "There has been a search for yield, and some funds have seen improvement in their return on their assets.", "But we have to bear in mind that globally, there is a limited supply of quality alternative assets.", "Funds are moving into private equity, real estate and some other alternative assets but more money going into these assets doesn't raise yields.", "It can only mean a lower return on these assets over time.", "The search for yield doesn't raise yields overall, it just redistributes yields among different players.", "So there are limits to this strategy for the pension and insurance fund industry as a whole.", "I should note that the challenge we are talking about in retirement security is not a problem only for the advanced economies.", "Several emerging economies too are entering a phase where their societies are ageing, and some are quite unprepared for it.", "Brazil is the most pronounced case, where the unsustainability of its social security system is reaching crisis proportions.", "Past promises have not been funded, are soon going to have to be funded, and they are not going to be able to fund it.", "China has also begun ageing.", "It has a complex system of retirement security, with multiple pension schemes in different provinces and for different groups.", "But China is in the process of reforms, integrating its systems and seeking to provide adequate coverage for all workers, and I think they will be getting there.", "Even in ASEAN, Thailand is going to begin ageing before long.", "And the Asian countries that grew quickly a few decades ago are also entering the ageing phase - societies like Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.", "We don't face quite the same problems as the rest of the world in Singapore - we have a defined contribution pension scheme which doesn't have the same problems of sustainability.", "But this is a global challenge.", "Low interest rates and societies that are ageing and fortunately living longer will pose challenges to retirement security everywhere.", "Globally, therefore, we need fundamental reforms.", "We can't fix the problem through investment strategies, certainly can't fix it by monetary policies.", "First, we have to enable people to work for long than they used to, in virtually every society that's getting older, and make it attractive for older people to work.", "Fortunately, each new generation of people entering their senior years is also healthier.", "But in a situation where we are going to have much longer lives, it is critical that we have the ability to earn a living and to save money over more years, so as to provide security and assurance through our retirement years.", "It's true everywhere in the world.", "Some countries have already recognised it through legislation.", "Denmark is a good example, of having linked their retirement age and pension age to life expectancy.", "Several other countries are considering the same thing.", "But it is not just about pushing back the retirement age or pension age.", "It is critical that we make it attractive for older citizens to work.", "That means not just providing jobs but rearranging the work place so that it becomes part of the culture to have older persons, experienced persons, in the team, in the work place.", "The culture of the work place has to change and the culture of the consumers has to change in a whole range of industries so as to accept and celebrate the presence of older persons at work.", "So that's one important reform over the next 10 to 15 years - enabling older persons to work for longer, it may be full time or part time, but make it attractive to work.", "The second important reform concerns the financial industry.", "We have to reduce the costs that ordinary savers face in saving for the retirement.", "There has over the last 30 years been a shift in the pensions industry towards defined contribution schemes - away from defined benefit schemes, because of the latter's unsustainability.", "But this shift towards defined contribution schemes has also led to a fragmented market place in many countries, and one where responsibility is placed on the individual to manage his or her funds and take on the risks.", "It is also by and large a landscape of funds that actively manage investments, rather than passively.", "So it's a fragmented marketplace, people have to choose between different funds to invest in and take their own risks, and the funds are largely actively managed.", "It's the case in the US, several countries in Europe, and in the UK and Australia, for example.", "That combination of factors, particularly the fragmentation of the pensions market and active management, has meant higher costs than are sustainable in the long term.", "The solution has to be greater pooling of funds and a greater reliance on passive investment management.", "Active management is not all it has been cracked up to be: it has not proven its worth for most ordinary savers preparing for their retirement.", "We do have to move towards a system, in a whole range of countries, of helping people save for the long term through passive investment funds, and pool savings to avoid fragmentation and excessive marketing costs.", "The savings in fees and charges matters: \u2022 If we can take one percentage point out of the fees and charges that ordinary savers pay in many market-based pension schemes, that one percentage point makes a large difference in retirement savings.", "Taken over a lifetime of work, that one percentage point will mean at least a 25% improvement in retirement savings.", "\u2022 In a whole range of countries, the experience has been that it has been difficult for people to manage their own funds.", "They don't make the right investment decisions.", "We have to think hard about the reforms that pool and collectivise savings, to reduce the costs for ordinary savers.", "A third challenge has to do with reforming healthcare systems.", "The advances in healthcare have been remarkable and that's largely why people are able to live for much longer than we used to.", "We are living healthier lives.", "But by and large, in a whole range of countries, we have extremely inefficient healthcare systems.", "Too much treatment takes place in hospitals rather than in primary care or in the community.", "And it is also a system where subsidies have been dispensed on an untargeted basis in many countries.", "The system is not sustainable and is going to take up a lot of resources in the future: both private and public resources that could otherwise be used to strengthen retirement adequacy and incomes.", "This is an important challenge, not just for sake of healthcare, but for the sake of retirement security.", "We need to move towards a fair, progressive and sustainable healthcare financing systems.", "If we don't, then our ability to afford decent retirement for all our citizens, in a whole range of countries, is going to be severely compromised.", "Emerging opportunities for insurance 29.", "Let me move now to some of the emerging opportunities in the insurance industry.", "It is a difficult environment in many respects -

transportation, communication and power links, water and environmental sustainability - in every area the needs are growing, the need to remove bottlenecks to economic growth and social development are growing.", "Traditionally, it has been a sector that has been financed by governments and banks.", "Governments will be constrained in the future, across the region.", "Although banks currently have ample liquidity, they too will over time become more constrained.", "So that combination of governments and banks isn't going to be able to cope with the rapid growth in financing for infrastructure in the future.", "\u2022 This is why institutional investors - insurers, pension funds and other long term investors - have become very important.", "For insurers, infrastructure is an attractive asset class.", "It is attractive as a potential diversifier of assets, and has the potential to provide reliable inflation-linked returns over time, and with low correlation to other conventional assets.", "But we need quality data for infrastructure to take off as an asset class for long term investors.", "We need quality data for reliable performance benchmarks to be constructed, and to allow long term investors to perform asset allocation on a reasonably reliable basis.", "That quality data doesn't yet exist but it is being put together by the EDHEC Infrastructure Institute in Singapore.", "By the end of this year they expect to have usable performance benchmarks, including for unlisted infrastructure debt and equity.", "The data has not been transparent, especially for privately-held investments, it has not been put together, and this is what EDHEC is doing.", "So that's one dimension of it.", "Getting the data together to allow institutional investors to allocate a desired portion of funds to infrastructure as an asset class.", "Second, the regulatory treatment for insurers has to evolve so as to make possible long term investments, including infrastructure investment.", "Some rethinking is already underway globally on the design of capital frameworks for insurers.", "It has to be aimed first of all at ensuring that individual insurers are on a sound prudential footing, not just for the short term but for the long term.", "It should also support efforts to ensure that our economies are able to grow and to remain healthy, which is also in the interests of every player.", "This means we have to support long term investment.", "\u2022 The European regulators are already in close consultation with the industry, on providing some measure of capital relief for long term investments.", "Globally too we have to do this.", "We need lower risk charges for equity held by insurers for the long term, including infrastructure.", "I hope globally regulators will arrive at an understanding that makes this possible.", "\u2022 Here in Singapore, MAS is engaging closely with the industry in this regard.", "We will be having another round of public consultation at the end of this month on our risk-based capital framework for insurers (or \"RBC 2\").", "The aim is to finalise our proposals for providing capital relief for long-term assets which match the cash flows of the liabilities.", "We will also be raising questions, as part of this review, on the merit of having a different set of risk charges for infrastructure in particular.", "Catastrophe insurance 36.", "The second major opportunity is in catastrophe insurance.", "The economic cost of natural disasters is growing.", "It's certainly growing here in Asia, a consequence partly of economic growth itself, a consequence of urbanisation and the growing concentration of wealth in cities in Asia, and a consequence of a higher incidence of natural disasters.", "\u2022 Lloyd's has estimated that even a modest an increase in penetration rates for catastrophe will allow for a large reduction in the economic costs that are being borne by governments and local communities in Asia.", "So far the take-up of catastrophe insurance in Asia has been woefully low.", "Part of the reason has to do with a lack of insurance awareness among businesses around the region.", "But it also has to do with data gaps - the industry needs good data on the frequency, location and economic impact of natural disasters, so that insurers and reinsurers can price risks adequately.", "So we have had a limited supply of insurance coverage, that has itself led to higher cost of protection, which in turn discourages demand for insurance against catastrophe risks.", "But we can solve this problem.", "We can overcome the fragmentation of data in Asia, pool data so as to facilitate more efficient underwriting of catastrophe risks.", "Here too, we have an initiative in Singapore called the Natural Catastrophe Data Analytics Exchange (Nat Cat DAX).", "\u2022 Nat Cat DAX is a public-private partnership, involving several leading global insurers, the public sector and our research institutes; \u2022 It is using high resolution data obtained through remote sensing technologies -
