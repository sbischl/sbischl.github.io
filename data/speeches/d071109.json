banking licenses or opening of special windows or creation of hubs/dedicated Islamic asset management funds, private equity funds and hedge funds etc.", "accompanied by Dow Islamic Index to which all such transactions subscribe too are large; (ii) development of Shariah knowledge and understanding and engagement of Shariah advisors and scholars which together are providing required consensus,

supervision of financial institutions; All these regional and global efforts are serious long term initiatives which are irreversible though maintaining and building momentum on these fronts would be critical to address the questions of sustainability and challenges facing this industry.", "Sustainability and challenges of Islamic finance Prospects for sustainability of Islamic finance appear promising, but there are associated challenges which need to be concurrently addressed while one exploits and maximizes the opportunities created by this discipline.", "First, the sustainability of Islamic finance stems from recognition that Islamic economic and financial architecture has a lot of appeal and depth going beyond Muslim countries.", "While initially conceived to be solely anchored on Riba free interest rate regime, there is now appreciation that advocacy to move to Islamic business and finance structure - whether on religious or social grounds - is not a \"slogan\" or mere religious pronunciation or condemnation of Riba but is supported by a complete and deep Islamic ideology.", "When studied carefully, it has its logic and basis in a comprehensive Islamic economic system which deals with allocation of resources, production and exchange of goods and services and distribution of wealth - all too familiar debates in conventional economic textbooks.", "Second, the confidence in sustainability of Islamic economic system emerges from the better understanding that this economic system is a well conceptualized, consistent and integrated framework.", "More interestingly, it is accompanied by a rich and an elaborate set of tenets which, among others, recognize the right to property supported by elaborate obligations for stakeholders, principles and rules of conduct, a contract system and institutional framework and procedures for enforcement of rules which all together lay the foundation for Islamic business and financial architecture.", "It is this substantive Islamic ideological and legal framework, governed by Shariah injunctions and principles that have translated into defining the public and private economic and social affairs that eventually help frame the business and financial relations.", "The core of these relationships is backed by solid principles of contracts, rights and obligations of parties to the contractual arrangements.", "Third, the sustainability of this system is reinforced by the business and financial relations that are guided by the logically defined emphasis on the preferred modes of transaction which advocates profit sharing and as such relies on \"ex-post\" variability rather \"than ex ante\" fixity in returns and consequently has built in risk sharing as a central element of transactions.", "Relevance of contracts is at the core of Islamic transactions which define the rules of game for sale and purchase/trade/exchange of goods and services.", "Financing contracts are than structured around the nature of transaction which could be either in the form of trade financing; asset based financing or different forms of partnerships.", "Under Islamic finance preference is given to trading of physical assets as well as trading of rights.", "Fourth, the confidence in sustainability emerges from the framework of enforcement implicit in Islamic system.", "The main driver of enforcement of contracts and rules-compliance in Islamic system is ideology and faith which is in turn influenced by Islam's emphasis on establishing an equitable, ethical, just, and fair socio-economic system.", "It is this feature which shapes up Islamic finance and also distinguishes it from the conventional finance.", "Although one can argue that sustainability of interest in Islamic Finance is tied solely to the response of Muslim population to their religious values and beliefs, but it has to be recognized that attraction in this discipline is now widely emerging as there is better understanding of Islamic economics and finance and mechanisms are being found to juxtapose the knowledge of conventional economics and financial engineering.", "Fifth, flexibility and innovation to structure different types of financial products which augur well for Islamic Finance's sustainability.", "What distinguishes Islamic finance is its emphasis on trading of goods and services and its advocacy for profit and risk sharing in businesses supported by a variety of partnership arrangements - this is in sharp contrast to loan based financing in conventional banks.", "By virtue of these characteristics Islamic finance offers prudent financing options being asset backed or equity based; particularly linkage of assets with financing ensures that transaction is less prone to debt crisis and funds are used for their prescribed purpose minimizing defaults resulting from improper use of borrowed funds.", "Concurrently it offers promising potential for offering alternate avenues for saving and investment for all segments of population.", "Sixth, market surveys confirm that the potential for retail, housing and project finance3 and innovation emerging in these markets is significant and augurs well for economic and financial services development.", "Islamic banks have registered double digit growth in retail markets.", "Penetration has occurred faster where personal banking solutions have been structured well and where information technology is used to offer online, ATMs and telephone banking services.", "By and large products are structured on murabaha principles where funds are allocated for particular projects or finance an asset (such as home ownership and automobiles) in which depositor shares in the project rather than bank profits and to structure ijara (leasing) with appropriate asset backing and legal structures.", "Islamic housing finance for acquisition and other purposes has evolved to be a natural and promising market to cater for huge home financing demand in Muslim countries.", "This market is gaining momentum following some interesting facilitation/incentives offered by some countries: for instance US has facilitated Islamic lease-to-own relationship by allowing bank to take title to property and in the UK Bank of England abolished double stamp duty on Islamic mortgages, ijarah and murabaha transactions, and rationalized of legal service fees and risk weightage etc.", "and Australia and Canada allowed adoption of declining balance partnership concepts to facilitate structuring Diminishing Musharaka contract etc.", "In some jurisdictions momentum for tapping retail market has been accelerated by partial or full conversion of conventional to Islamic banks such as Saudi Arabia - challenges of which cannot be underestimated as it involves converting the loan book to Shariah compliant modes of product.", "Stand alone Islamic banks have a challenging task of competing with the conventional players who have an edge of longevity and customer loyalty and economies of scale.", "High level of customer service, offering full product range, introducing a level of transparency in transactions, devising unsecured personal loan products (a wave emerging with adoption of tawarruq product), introducing Shariah compliant credit cards, handling properly the unfunded businesses and improving efficiencies are some of responses to challenge of competition.", "Large scale business opportunities however lie in exploiting project finance.", "Successful application and integration of Islamic instruments with the conventional financing has helped in this area while facilitating closure of large and complex multisource financing deals.", "Project financing, backed by asset and equity and structured using combination of Ijara, Istisna,, Sukuk and Musharika etc.", "has offered opportunities for risk diversification, avenues for resource mobilization and revenue sharing and performance of services between contractual parties.", "These deals have illustrated how conventional and Islamic financing can blend and coexist under common legal and regulatory arrangements.", "Finally, more than conventional finance, Islamic finance emphasizes just and equitable financial system.", "Among others, Islamic finance offers a financial inclusive option to Muslim who have excluded themselves from financial services in absence of riba free services.", "Since a number of Muslim countries suffer from low financial services penetration, bringing in the appeal of Shariah compliant financing mechanism could turn out to be a powerful tool for enhancing access to development finance and empowering the poor and vulnerable groups.", "It is important to recognize that Islamic finance confines itself to largely socially and development projects and institutions are not permitted to invest in prohibited or socially undesirable investments.", "Emphasis on ethical issues and rigorous self-regulation in terms of Shariah supervision ensures fair play and justice and offers superior consumer protection model.", "Furthermore it induces higher financial discipline and places stringent ethical standards for all stakeholders that offers a strong and unique model of governance.", "In conclusion, encouraging developments and trends in Islamic Finance lend confidence that this industry has taken off.", "However, there are varying motivation and driving factors for the development of this industry ranging from religious fervor to the opportunities that exist in Islamic finance for broadening and deepening the process of financial intermediation which augurs well for financial innovation and engineering, enhancing the financial services penetration in national jurisdictions and for cross border capital flows.", "While the size of Islamic financial industry is still quite small as a proportion of the total world's financial assets, the current growth trends and the investments in infrastructure in development of its Islamic Finance networks and its regulatory and supervisory systems, lend confidence that this industry has promising potential.", "Prospects for this industry appear comforting because of variety of factors - most significant being the strengths of Islamic ideology and economic system which offer a complete framework for the Islamic finance industry.", "Islamic financial system lays down rules of conduct and contractual arrangements, and offers feasible financing structure which emphasize trade and equity financing that together will help the much needed financial diversification in Islamic countries.", "Islamic finance also has potential to blend economic and social objectives and address the ethical aspects of financing effectively.", "As such it is generally more acceptable in populations with moderate to strong inclinations toward managing their financial relationships in line with their beliefs.", "This can thus help in poverty alleviation through inclusion of a larger proportion of population into the banking system giving them access to credit and mobilizing their savings effectively.", "The emerging solutions and application to structure Islamic finance innovatively have helped cater for all types of markets and financing requirements ranging from retail to project and home financing to equity funds and products and insurance.", "Industry effort to benchmark pricing and apply legal, regulatory service standards at par with conventional products and standards has also helped encouraged confidence in the system.", "Going forward, the sustainability of Islamic Finance would rest in how the international community builds on the momentum achieved thus far.", "This would require (i) Further deepening the efforts to enhance the legal and regulatory framework of Islamic finance consistent with the international practices.", "(ii) Continued strive to conform and align the structures and products in line with the Shariah principles would help Muslim population's motivation to turn to this alternative mechanism of financing, while attracting others to product and risk management and mitigation innovation and additional option that this window offers.", "(iii) Recognizing that Islamic finance has perpetuated and changed the dynamics of cross border private capital flow, this industry has great potential to augment the process of globalization and financial integration, but this requires more cooperation and vigilance on the part of home and host regulators.", "(iv) Launching aggressive efforts to implement the evolving Islamic financial regulatory and supervisory standards and capturing the different types of risks associated with Islamic finance, while launching consumer protection frameworks.", "(v) Promoting more financial diversification by encouraging financial innovation and Islamic capital market development."],
