economic activity continued to be weak throughout the euro area in the first quarter.", "Credit conditions still differ from country to country, owing not only to the diversity of macroeconomic situations but also to the residual uncertainty as to the future conditions of funding in the national banking systems.", "At the beginning of this month, considering the contraction of demand, the prospect of prolonged cyclical weakness and the decline of both actual and expected inflation in the medium term to well below 2 per cent, the ECB Governing Council lowered the rate on main refinancing operations further, taking it to a new historic low of 0.5 per cent.", "The Council reiterated that the unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates would continue for as long as necessary and in any case until July of next year.", "The ECB, in concert with other European institutions, is examining initiatives to promote a market in securities backed by loans to nonfinancial corporations.", "The Governing Council stands ready to intervene again as new information becomes available and to consider all possible measures for maintaining credit conditions throughout the area consistent with the monetary policy stance.", "The ECB's management of official interest rates has proven effective;

it is nearly 40 per cent among young people and higher still among those in the South.", "The financial and international origins of the crisis, on which economic policy makers have mostly focused, must not blind us to the fact that in Italy more than in other countries the cyclical ups and downs are superimposed on serious structural weaknesses.", "In the ten years preceding the crisis, this was already evident in the overall performance of the Italian economy, which fared worse than those of nearly all the other major advanced countries.", "We failed to respond to the extraordinary geopolitical, technological and demographic changes of the last quarter-century.", "The adjustment required, and put off for so long, is historic in scope.", "It will affect the accumulation of tangible and intangible capital, product specialization and the organization of production, the education system, skills, career paths, the characteristics of the welfare system and income distribution, the positional rents that are incompatible with the new competitive environment, and the working of government.", "An adjustment of this magnitude needs a decisive contribution from the political system, but the response of society and all the forces of production is essential.", "Firms are called upon to make an exceptional effort to ensure the success of the transformation by investing resources of their own, seizing the opportunities for growth, adapting their corporate structures and organization, relying on innovation and their ability to hold their own in the most dynamic markets.", "They have demonstrated their ability to do so at other times in our history.", "Some are doing so now.", "But too few have been willing to take the plunge; at times, instead, the illusory solution of public support is advocated.", "This year's Report contains a special section on innovation in Italy.", "The ability to renew products and processes, to export to emerging markets and to internationalize, including by heading or joining global production chains, divides the firms that are continuing to expand sales revenue and value added from those that, instead, are struggling to remain on the market.", "The recession has deepened this divide and made the inadequacy of some parts of the productive system glaringly obvious.", "Transferring activity from ailing to growing sectors and firms requires profound changes in employment relationships and in the education system.", "The point is not so much to foresee which sectors and activities will attract consumption and investment demand in the decades to come as to facilitate the transition, reduce the social costs, and capitalize on opportunities.", "Many occupations are disappearing; in the years to come young people cannot simply count on replacing their seniors as they retire.", "Now is the time to establish the right conditions for the birth and growth of new enterprises and to generate new job opportunities.", "Lifelong vocational training must be developed to cover working careers characterized by mobility and change, with workers safeguarded by reinforced safety nets and insurance systems, both public and private, during periods of inactivity.", "Schools and universities must support this process by ensuring education of adequate quality and quantity, acting with determination to raise levels of academic achievement and develop new skills.", "Italy needs conditions that are conducive to enterprise and to the reallocation of productive factors.", "The lag we have accumulated is accentuated by a redundant regulatory framework, by complex and costly administrative obligations that must be drastically reduced, law that must be rendered more certain, widespread corruption that must be stamped out, and insufficient protection from crime.", "Immediate, visible progress in removing these serious obstacles can stimulate productive investment, including from abroad, in all the country's regions, especially in the South, where what is most critical is the environment for business activity, on which the balanced development of our economy ultimately depends.", "The programme of reforms launched in the last two years stems from these considerations.", "But in many instances, after the enactment of reform laws, the implementing measures have been slow to follow; in some cases they are still lacking and administrative practices remain unchanged.", "This is a recurrent feature of our country's history: the chief difficulties reside not so much in the substance of the laws as in their effective application.", "The pace of reform has slackened in the past year, owing in part to the progressive deterioration of the political climate.", "In resuming the path of reform with determination - as the European Commission too urges in the recommendations accompanying the closure of the excessive deficit procedure - it is vital to adopt a comprehensive approach that fixes medium-term objectives from the outset.", "Structural reforms take time; they can be implemented in succession, provided that they are designed as part of a bigger picture that immediately clarifies their goals, implications and benefits.", "A credible programme can have an impact on expectations at once, dispelling uncertainties, fostering investor confidence and favouring the prospects of employment and income, above all for the young, who today find it difficult to imagine any future in our country.", "The consolidation of the public finances was also postponed for too long; in the face of demographic pressure on important expenditure items, the priorities for the allocation of resources were not clearly set.", "In 2007 public expenditure excluding interest payments was 43 per cent of GDP, two percentage points more than in 1997; the primary surplus had contracted by more than three points.", "In the same period in Germany primary expenditure decreased by more than four percentage points of GDP to just under 41 per cent.", "The response of budgetary policy in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers was prudent in Italy: the support to economic activity in 2009 was provided through discretionary measures affecting the composition of the budget, without increasing the deficit.", "From 2010 onwards, the budgetary stance became restrictive.", "Following the explosion of sovereign risk, to avoid a potentially devastating confidence and liquidity crisis, in the second half of 2011 a correction to the public finances of the order of 5 per cent of GDP was introduced.", "This made it possible to bring the deficit down within the 3 per cent limit in 2012 and to aim at structural balance as early as this year.", "The adjustment had a negative impact on GDP growth in 2012 of about one percentage point.", "A larger impact, of about two points, resulted from the effects of the liquidity crisis on the cost and availability of credit for the private sector, the slowdown in world trade, and the increase in uncertainty and the related loss of confidence.", "The adjustment of the public finances helped to reduce the tensions on the government securities market, thereby preventing even worse developments.", "The advances made must be preserved.", "Squandering them would have grave consequences.", "It would be illusory to imagine we can overcome the crisis by means of budget deficits: investors and market participants allow us only a thin margin of confidence today.", "The volume of government securities to be placed every year to finance the deficit and, above all, to roll over the maturing debt is on the order of \u20ac400 billion.", "This year there is no room for any further increase in the deficit, since the margin available has been earmarked to pay general government's commercial debts in relation to capital outlays.", "These payments can be brought forward, however, and those relating to current expenditure, which affect the debt but not the deficit, can be increased; above all, no new debts of this kind must be formed.", "The conditions need to be created for taking full advantage of the existing instruments and subsidies to enable young people to enter and remain in the labour market.", "The European Commission has undertaken to examine ways to allow national budgets to deviate temporarily from their medium-term objectives - keeping the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP - in order to finance investment projects, subject to specific conditions.", "In Italy, this could benefit investment to protect and enhance the value of the environment and our artistic and cultural heritage.", "Reductions in taxation, which are necessary in the medium term and which could be planned now, will necessarily be selective, giving priority to labour and production: the tax wedge on labour acts as a brake on employment and business activity.", "Tax evasion distorts the allocation of the factors of production, gives rise to unfair competition, hinders growth in firm size and increases the burden borne by law-abiding taxpayers.", "It needs to be fought at the supranational level as well.", "A significant contribution to better fiscal conduct can derive from the simplification and rationalization of taxes and formalities.", "The certainty of tax rules and their careful and balanced formulation can influence expectations, and hence demand, more and better than immediate tax cuts of uncertain sustainability.", "A reallocation of expenditure in favour of the more productive components is possible by pursuing improvements in efficiency and recoveries of resources across the board.", "If this method is adopted permanently, the functioning of general government can more nearly approach international standards.", "Significant results will not be possible without involving local government.", "Transferring resources on the basis of standard costs, with any excess expenditure borne by the local authorities concerned, encourages the dissemination of best practices.", "The efficient use of public resources requires a reassessment of the different levels of government, with the elimination of redundancies.", "The banks and lending The outlook for domestic demand also depends largely on credit access conditions.", "Lending to firms slowed sharply in the second part of 2011 and since the beginning of December of that year has contracted by about \u20ac60 billion.", "The decline, which was particularly abrupt at first owing to the banks' severe difficulties in raising funds on the international markets due to heightened sovereign risk, continued at a more moderate pace during 2012; in the first four months of 2013 the contraction accelerated again, to nearly 4.0 per cent on an annual basis.", "Lending to households has also declined but less so.", "The cost of credit to firms, which rose in the course of 2011, declined for most of last year but stopped falling in the autumn.", "Bank lending rates are still higher than the euro-area average by about one percentage point for loans to firms and by half a point for mortgage loans to households.", "The banking system is the main source of funding for our economy.", "At the end of 2012 bank credit to firms and households amounted to just under \u20ac1.5 trillion, or 94 per cent of GDP; banks' investment in government securities came to around \u20ac350 billion.", "The highly unfavourable state of the economy depresses credit demand today.", "The contraction in lending reflects the decline in business investment, the fall in purchases of durable goods and the weak property market.", "But the decline in lending is also due in significant measure to the tightening of supply, which is in turn linked to a deterioration in customer creditworthiness and its impact on banks' asset quality.", "In turn, the credit supply conditions have an adverse effect on economic activity, creating a negative spiral that must be broken.", "The acute restriction of credit supply at the end of 2011 in response to funding difficulties was attenuated by the unlimited supply of three-year liquidity by the Eurosystem and by the increase in the range of the assets eligible as collateral for refinancing operations.", "The Bank of Italy allowed Italian counterparties to use less creditworthy illiquid assets, in this case charging all the associated risks to its own balance sheet.", "The collateral pledged with the Bank of Italy based on bank loans currently amounts to around \u20ac180 billion, which represents slightly less than a third of all the assets eligible for central bank refinancing and half of those actually in the collateral pool.", "Thanks to these measures immediate liquidity risks have been averted.", "The funds obtained through the three-year refinancing operations do not constitute a permanent resource, however.", "Tension on the government securities markets has not completely dissipated.", "There is still uncertainty regarding the banks' ability to regain full access to the international markets, particularly the long-term segments.", "We are working, through discussions with the banks and in collaboration with the ECB, to expand the range of eligible assets.", "An increased risk of corporate default is driving up the interest rates on loans.", "Since the middle of 2012 this has offset the effect of the lowering of official rates and, more recently, of the decline in yields on government securities.", "The credit supply tensions seem to be affecting even firms with a balanced financial situation, albeit to a smaller degree.", "The difficulties are greatest for small and medium-sized firms, which are less able to tap other sources of finance.", "Gross issues of corporate bonds amounting to \u20ac35 billion last year were attributable almost exclusively to large groups.", "In 2012 the interest rate differential between bank loans of up to \u20ac1 million and those for larger amounts averaged 160 basis points, about twice the value recorded in the three years prior to the crisis.", "At the end of 2012 the stock of bad debt had risen to 7.2 per cent of total lending, compared with 3.4 per cent in 2007;
