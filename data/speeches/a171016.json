understanding would have cascading effects, not just on compliance with international standards, but towards effective implementation of AML/CFT measures in achieving the intended outcomes.", "While efforts can be made to strengthen the legal and supervisory framework, from the financial industry perspective, strong understanding of risks and effective application of risk mitigation, including commensurate application of the AML/CFT measures are critical for the meaningful conduct and practices of financial institutions.", "This is particularly important in the conduct of CDD and transaction monitoring that will facilitate strong financial intelligence and reporting, to achieve the enforcement objectives.", "Authorities are committed to continuously enhance the current legal and supervisory framework.", "At the same time, financial institutions and other reporting institutions must be robust in their current practices and compliance.", "Technological Development Everyone

advantages and the risks of such rapid technological advancement while keeping abreast with the latest innovations.", "New devices, software, applications and inventions will continue to emerge.", "The challenge is for us to keep pace and ensure that industry players understand the potential benefits as well as the risk they bear.", "As the financial industry evolves into digital, it is inevitable that the industry becomes vulnerable to various new threats and risk factors, especially in the domain of financial crimes and terrorism financing.", "In the effort to mitigate these risks, it is important that we embrace technology and use it to our advantage in order to strengthen our defences against financial crimes and terrorism financing.", "There are many areas in which the

that offers new and exciting opportunities as well as challenges for the industry and regulators.", "However, cryptocurrency is vulnerable to criminal abuse due to the anonymity it provides to its users and its ability to facilitate cross-border transactions, potentially allowing illicit funds to be transferred globally without a trace.", "We have seen a range of actions taken by regulatory bodies across the globe in order to manage this risk, ranging from total prohibition, partial regulation, to full legalisation.", "Each country will need to make an assessment of risks and rewards in its own unique context.", "We are also in the midst of making such an assessment and we do so with an objective that has and will always remain steadfast - that is to balance between safeguarding our economy and allowing room for innovation and progress.", "Increasing Threat of Cyber crimes Let me now touch on the increasing threat of cyber-crime.", "We have seen a double digit growth in

contribute towards the country's security and stability, which is an important catalyst to a balanced economic growth and development.", "Allow me to share some of the ideas and expectations with regard to the responsibilities of compliance officers.", "As we are all aware, the requirements imposed are now moving towards principle-based rather than that of prescriptive or rule-based.", "This provides institutions with the authority or freedom to develop their own internal policy that commensurates with their risk and profile while upholding the policy intent.", "Thus, it is up to compliance officers to support the institutions to develop such comprehensive policies and to ensure they are properly implemented within the institution and by all relevant staff.", "The compliance office should also be proactive in providing accurate and proper information for their clients, especially the general public, on the intent and requirement of their policies to avoid misrepresentations of regulatory requirements and the institutions' own business decisions.", "Compliance officers should be proactive in recommending efforts and initiatives within the institutions

Outcome 4 on whether RIs adequately apply AML/CFT preventive measures commensurate with their risks, and report suspicious transactions.", "I wish to highlight that, based on Mutual Evaluation Exercise conducted on 38 countries so far, majority of the private sector within these countries, including developed countries are still unable to demonstrate the characteristics of an effective system; namely understanding risks, comprehensive internal control and compliance programme including application of customer due diligence on suspicious transactions reporting.", "I would like to echo the discussion during the Plenary session yesterday that an effective antifinancial crime programme requires concerted efforts from every line in the institutions, be it the first, second or third line of defence.", "It also demands collaborative efforts by other functions within the institutions, including an updated IT system and infrastructure, comprehensive and continuous staff training programmes, and good understanding of risks.", "Most importantly, the oversight and support from senior management and Board of Directors of the institutions.", "Before I conclude my speech, allow me to share with you some developments from the regulatory perspective that you can expect in the near future.", "As you may be well aware, our national ML/TF risk assessment (NRA) is currently in progress and is expected to be concluded by year end.", "The results of the assessment will be accompanied with some guidance from regulators.", "This should be used as a basis in your institutional risk assessment to eventually align your operations on a risk-based approach.", "You can also expect introductions and amendments to AML/CFT policies, in response to the NRA as well as
