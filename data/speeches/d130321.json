guidance with a view to addressing the gaps witnessed and strengthening the governance framework.", "The OECD Steering Group on Corporate Governance, which examined the governance failures, observed that while the corporate governance weaknesses in remuneration, risk management, board practices and the exercise of shareholder rights had played an important role in the development of global

"A strengthened management information system (MIS) supported by robust information technology platform is a necessary pre-condition for enhancing Board efficiency in oversight and decision making.", "Similarly, augmented skill sets and experience at the level of independent directors would go a long way in enhancing the Board capacity.", "Strong MIS facilitates risk reporting to the boards in an effective and comprehensive manner, which in turn enhances transparency and causes informed decision taking.", "Robust information technology systems are a necessary condition for supporting the MIS framework as the quality of risk information that the Boards and the top management receive depends largely on the quality and robustness of the information technology systems.", "In addition to prescribing the risk appetite for the institution, the board also needs to lay down appropriate risk strategy and ensure that this is institutionalised throughout the organization.", "This would entail, aligning risk management processes with the overall business strategy, clearly defining the roles and responsibilities down the hierarchy, establishing accountability and reinforcing change with communication and training.", "The Board and the senior management oversight must be supplemented with effective leadership by the Chairman and the chief executive officer (CEO), and informed non-executive directors.", "The Boards must get much more intimately involved in risk matters and have a firmer understanding of the key risks faced by the business.", "Effective risk governance also demands that each director is aware of the breadth of risks faced by the bank.", "Directors add value to the Board when they have financial expertise, are aware of risk fundamentals and techniques, and are able to manage dynamics with executives.", "Board level risk committees have an important role to play in the overall risk governance framework.", "Apart from monitoring the firm's strategic-risk profile on an on-going basis, such committees would also be responsible for defining the firm's overall risk appetite; approving major transactions above a firm's risk threshold, and; establishing limit structures and risk policies for use within individual businesses.", "Presence of a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is expected to strengthen the risk management framework.", "However, independence of the CRO, with necessary stature to influence decisions, would be a critical element in ensuring the effectiveness of the post in risk management process as also the strategic risk management related decisions.", "The CRO must report directly to the CEO and the Board and be responsible for all risks, risk management and control functions.", "Another important requirement is integrating risk with business strategy and compensation.", "Risk - and return on risk - need to be core component of any performance measure, and should be explicitly factored into incentive and compensation schemes.", "Compensation must be formally aligned with actual performance, such as through adding more rigorous risk-based measures to scorecards.", "This would also involve moving to longer vesting periods, and increasing deferred compensation.", "The fragmented organisation of risk data into separate silos slows down risk management process and hinders the capability to respond to new regulatory requirements.", "The financial crisis has pushed both supervisors and market players to move towards an integrated approach to risk data that brings down the silos in organisation.", "Only by integrating data models, processes and methodologies can a bank achieve higher performance in terms of data quality.", "The risk management systems must take into account the technical limitations of risk models, such as Value at Risk (VaR).", "Stress testing and scenario analysis need to be established as truly effective management tools and should be integrated and standardized across business lines, types of risk and asset classes.", "Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s thematic review on risk governance The Financial Stability Board (FSB) in its Thematic Review on Risk Governance7 has observed that since crisis, national authorities have taken several measures to improve regulatory and supervisory oversight of risk governance at financial institutions such as developing or strengthening existing regulation or guidance, raising supervisory expectations for the risk management function, engaging more frequently with the board and the management, and assessing the accuracy and usefulness of the information provided to the Board to enable effective discharge of responsibilities.", "The evaluation also found that in many jurisdictions, the governance practices are more advanced that those prescribed under national guidance.", "This, the report opined, may have been motivated by firms' need to regain market confidence rather than regulatory requirements.", "The results of the Review support the finding that the firms in the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis have made the most progress.", "However, there are significant gaps relative to the criteria developed, particularly in risk management.", "The report points to the differences in progress across regions.", "While firms in advanced economies have adopted more of the desirable risk governance practices, nearly 65 per cent of the firms that reside in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) did not meet all of the criteria for the risk management function.", "The report notes that more work needs to be done in the areas such as elevation of CRO position, establishment of an effective risk appetite framework (RAF), improving the chief audit executive (CAE)'s access to directors beyond those on the audit committee, etc.", "Corporate governance of banks Banking regulation in India shifted from prescriptive mode to prudential mode in 1990s, which implied a shift in balance away from regulation and towards corporate governance.", "Banks are accorded greater freedom and flexibility to draw up their own business plans and implementation strategies consistent with their comparative advantage.", "This freedom necessitated tighter governance standards requiring bank boards to assume the primary responsibility and the directors to be more knowledgeable and aware and also exercise informed judgement on various strategies and policy choices.", "With a view to strengthen corporate governance, over a period of time, various guidelines have been issued in matters relating to the role to be played by the Board, fit and proper criteria for the directors of banks, bifurcation of the post of Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), remuneration etc.", "Recognising that ownership of banks by one or few individuals could be detrimental to the public interest, especially, depositors' interests, it is stipulated that, in India, banks should have a diversified ownership model.", "To ensure that ownership and control of banks are well diversified, guidelines on ownership and governance in private sector banks were issued by the Reserve Bank in February 2005.", "Another important regulatory prescription in this regard is the requirement of Reserve Bank's prior approval for any acquisition of shares in private sector banks resulting in a shareholding of 5 per cent or more of the total paid up capital of the bank.", "The importance of diversified ownership is also underlined in the recent guidelines on new bank licenses wherein it is stipulated that Non-Operative Financial Holding Companies (NOFHC) which set up new banks should, after the initial lock in period of five years, bring down their equity capital of the bank from the minimum 40% while setting up to 15% within 12 years.", "To ensure \"Fit and Proper\" status of the groups that would set up new banks, it is also stipulated that entities / groups should have a past record of sound credentials and integrity, be financially sound with a successful track record of 10 years.", "Corporate governance of Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) Traditionally, Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) in India were small family run businesses some of which accepted deposits and engaged mainly in activities such as lending.", "Over the years, the NBFC sector has not only grown in size but also in terms of interconnectedness and systemic importance.", "Today, even though the sector has a total asset size constituting just above 12% of that of scheduled commercial banks, some of the NBFCs have grown very big and are operating as conglomerates with business interests spread across insurance, broking, mutual fund, real estate etc.", "Keeping in consideration the growing significance of NBFCs in the financial system and their interconnectedness with the banking sector there is a strong case for strengthening their governance framework so as to not only protect the individual institutions and their depositors, but also to ensure the stability of the entire financial system.", "Further, NBFCs have exposures to sensitive sectors such as real estate and capital markets and they also rely on wholesale funding, all of which point to the requirement of robust internal controls and governance framework to ensure their stability.", "During the crisis, while none of the shortcomings as observed globally during the GFC manifested in any significant way in the Indian NBFC sector, a temporary crisis of confidence did emanate which affected some of the NBFCs.", "The lack of confidence exposed the shortcomings in the funding model and consequent problems in the overall risk management framework of these NBFCs which were relying heavily on short term wholesale sources such as mutual funds to fund long term assets.", "Further, certain shortcomings in the corporate governance were observed in a section of NBFCs viz; those in the microfinance institutions (MFI) sector, leading to near collapse of the sector.", "Distorted financial incentives such as short term profit maximization / undue profiteering and excessive managerial compensation that were the hallmarks of the GFC were the leading contributors to the MFI crisis.", "The corporate governance issues in the MFI sector were exacerbated by some of the \"for profit\" MFIs, dominated and controlled by promoter shareholders which led to inadequate internal checks and balances over executive decision making and conflict of interests at various levels.", "Other undesirable practices such as connected lending, excessively generous compensation for senior management and founders/ directors and the failure of internal controls leading to frauds, precipitated the crisis.", "Some of the MFIs are also alleged to have chased high growth trajectory at the expense of corporate best practices.", "While drawing comparisons between the US subprime crisis and Indian MFI crisis, in an article titled \"Microfinance Industry in India: Some thoughts\" in Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) (October 8, 2011), Dr. Y.V.Reddy, former Governor, RBI, had observed that opaque practices, high salaries and commissions including unethical business and leverage were prevalent in MFIs.", "Recognizing the significance of NBFCs in the overall financial system, measures were undertaken to strengthen the regulatory framework in terms of stipulation of capital adequacy and exposure norms in 2006.", "Subsequentlyin2007, guidelines on corporate governance for NBFCs were issued by the Reserve Bank of India.", "The listed NBFCs were already required to comply with the provisions of the Listing Agreement of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), others being governed by the relevant provisions in the Companies Act, While the frameworks laid down by the various regulators / Companies Act may appear similar and over lapping in some areas, there are a few differences.", "Companies Act does not differentiate between financial, non-financial companies and SEBI Guidelines are generally from the perspective of investor protection with emphasis on disclosure and transparency.", "Therefore, RBI being the prudential regulator of NBFCs, additionally lays emphasis on risk management framework and the business practices etc.", "and its framework is mainly from the angle of depositor / customer protection.", "Reserve Bank's guidelines on corporate governance are applicable to only NBFCs with certain threshold of business i.e.", "with a certain deposit base or asset size.", "Recent developments in NBFC sector Reserve Bank has recently issued draft guidelines on corporate governance of NBFCs based on the recommendations of the Working Group on the issues and concerns in the NBFC sector (Chair: Ms. Usha Thorat).", "The guidelines aim to fine tune the framework for NBFCs by aligning the same with the businesses that they deal in and the growth in size, interconnectedness and systemic importance of the sector.", "The Guidelines address issues such as multiple directorships, continuing due diligence process with a reporting requirement to RBI, self certified \"fit and proper\" criteria and disclosures that are specific to NBFCs' business, such as disclosures on provision coverage ratio, Asset Liability profile, movement of NPAs, off-balance sheet exposures, structured products issued by them etc.", "Other requirements include prior approval of RBI for change in control of any registered NBFCs.", "It is indicated that big NBFCs with asset size of Rs.", "1000 crore and above would require prior approval of RBI for appointment of CEO and would need to comply with Clause 49 provisions (of SEBI listing agreement) even if unlisted.", "NBFCs with asset size of Rs.", "100 crore and above would be required to comply with the disclosure requirements specified in Clause 49 and of certain financial indicators.", "Given the recent episodes in the MFI sector, the corporate governance guidelines for MFIs have also been revamped.", "Measures are aimed at checking undesirable business practices like multiple lending, alleged coercive practices and charging excessive interest rates, etc.", "The guidelines are aimed at enhancing the \"self discipline principle\" in these NBFCs.", "Measures include pricing of credit, restricting lending to a borrower by not more than two MFIs, sharing credit information with a Credit Information Bureau, review of Fair Practices Code (FPC) etc.", "A Self Regulatory Organisation (SRO) also is envisaged for the sector as a watchdog.", "While the final framework is still being evolved, the role envisaged for the present, inter alia, is to ensure good governance in the industry by way of client protection with enforcement powers to check violations to codes of conduct / regulations.", "Governance, like regulation, is an evolving concept and is continuously fine tuned to suit the dynamic economic and business environment.", "Global financial crisis has given us an opportunity for strengthening both the regulatory as well as governance frameworks, by highlighting gaps that exacerbated the crisis.", "There is an interesting debate over whether and how much regulation can substitute board level governance.", "While regulation is imposed from outside, corporate governance is internal and is more in the nature of self regulation which ensures that the principles and rules laid down by the regulations are scrupulously adhered to.", "Prior to the crisis, the emphasis was increasingly on self regulation through robust corporate governance so that the regulation could remain largely principle based and less prescriptive.", "However, serious lapses observed in governance framework during the crisis, tilted the balance in favour of more rigorous regulation.", "I am of the view that both regulation and corporate governance have to complement each other.", "Effective regulation furthers corporate governance and effective corporate governance ensures that the objectives of the regulation are met, with minimal regulatory intervention.", "References Dowd, Kevin and Hutchinson, Martin, \"Alchemists Loss\", Times Group Books Financial Stability Board (Feb 2013), Thematic Review on Risk Governance, Peer Review Group of
