accelerate its pace in terms of its technological adoption or else events will dictate the shape of the industry's future.", "I urge the industry to come together and focus on the long term benefits,

engagement and interest.", "The industry must abandon the mindset that \"insurance is sold not bought\", and design products that people actually need and want to buy.", "Such products must also be
