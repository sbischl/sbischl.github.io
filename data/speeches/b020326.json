sectors of the economy to remain competitive.", "The diversified economic structure, the enhanced mobility of capital and labour has also provided Malaysia with increased resilience to weather external shocks.", "Malaysia also had the flexibility of policy to respond to the circumstances.", "In all cases, when an exchange rate regime has failed, it was not due to the regime itself, but due to the weaknesses in the economy and the financial system.", "Having undergone significant transformation and emerging with a much strengthened set of fundamentals, the Malaysian and regional economies are better able to absorb the volatility in the exchange rates.", "Countries are also more cognizant of the costs of currency depreciation, particularly on confidence.", "As an example, comparing the response of regional currencies during the two episodes of yen depreciation, one in the early part of 2001 and the other towards the end of 2001 and early 2002, it is clear that the response of regional exchange rates was significantly more muted during the most recent episode.", "The experience has shown that periods during which many of the countries in the region had experienced significant declines in their exchange rates, it was difficult to find clear evidence of a relationship between the degree of depreciation of the exchange rate and the growth in exports.",

performance.", "Current conditions favour monetary policy in 2002 to remain accommodative, reinforcing the continuing counter-cyclical policies.", "Monetary policy will build on the gains from the

independent advice on their financial options.", "Given the right strategic focus, there is tremendous potential for future growth in the life insurance sector, particularly in products and services that provide for retirement needs, capital accumulation and long-term care.", "Given the right strategic focus, there is tremendous potential for future growth in the life insurance sector, particularly in products and services that provide for retirement needs, capital accumulation and long-term care.", "To achieve sustainable growth, there is a need for insurers to intensify research

training and access to advisory services, as well as channels to market their products and services.", "The formulation of a comprehensive framework for the development of SMEs will be based on a survey of SMEs conducted by BNM through the banking system.", "As part of the effort to strengthen the economy's institutional structure further, a new legislation, the Development Financial Institutions Act 2002 (DFI Act), has been enacted and came into force in February 2002.", "The new Act empowers BNM to enforce the various provisions of the Act and to date 6 DFIs have been placed under the purview of the Act.", "DFIs, as a component of the financial sector will continue to play an important role in the socio-economic development of the country, in particular, in providing financing facilities to certain targeted sectors of the economy.", "Strategies are, therefore, formulated to promote the development of efficient and effective DFIs.", "The ultimate objective for the DFIs is to achieve their mandated functions at minimum cost to the Government.", "Moving forward, the focus will be on strengthening the overall financial and structural capacity as well as improving
