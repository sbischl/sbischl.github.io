but how should policy react if a bail-in also affects small investors who are not well informed?", "Intelligent political solutions are needed to deal with potential nega- tive distributional effects.", "A structured evaluation of reforms can give answers to these questions.", "Evaluations aim at assessing the costs and benefits of reforms and to improve - if necessary - elements of the new rules and the new institutional framework.", "Evaluations emphasize the social costs and benefits of reforms through causal impact assessments.", "Dealing with the new bail-in rules is a concrete example of how we can learn from experi- ence.", "Contrary to what is sometimes suggested by the public debate, the new rules were applied in handling the first cases.", "Shareholders and some subordinated creditors had to take losses (i.e.", "they were \u201ebailed in\").", "At the same time, weaknesses in the institutional framework have become evident, including inconsistencies between national and interna- tional rules for dealing with the insolvencies of banks.", "Also, the decision process was of- ten overly lengthy.", "Moreover, experience shows that credible regimes for the recovery and resolution of banks require a public backstop.", "Otherwise, there is the risk that necessary decisions are delayed and monetary authorities are pressured to assume some of the risks.", "At the same time, designing a public backstop is - by its very nature - not an easy task.", "When- ever public money is at stake, there is the risk that public budgets will be overburdened.", "Another example of how we can learn from experience regards the processes for dealing with money laundering.", "In keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, combatting money laundering is a task that had been assigned to the member states.", "Yet, structures that fa- cilitate money laundering do not stop at national borders.", "Therefore, with the \"5th Anti- Money Laundering Directive\", the European Commission tightened its rules governing the fight against money laundering and strengthened cooperation between national institu- tions.", "Sharing responsibilities between member states and the European level (SSM/ECB) should thus be improved.", "Evaluating the effects of reforms is not only about an assessment of existing regulations and recently agreed measures.", "Rather, it is about identifying and potentially closing po- tential gaps and weaknesses.", "In doing so, evaluations need to take into account that the market environment is chang- ing.", "Global risks, changing patterns of foreign trade, and new technologies affect price and financial stability as well as payments systems.", "All this needs to be taken into ac- count when discussing potential regulatory consequences.", "Based on a French-German initiative, for example, the G20 is currently looking at the risks and opportunities posed by crypto-assets and crypto-tokens.", "Developing European financial markets While many post-crisis reforms have focused on banks, developing European financial markets is an important project going ahead.", "Investments and innovations are needed in many areas of the economy - in response to demographic change and an aging popula- tion, digitalization, and climate change.", "These investments into the future, in turn, require strong and stable financial markets.", "In Europe, however, legacies from the crisis still burden the banking sector.", "In some countries, non-performing loans remain an issue; in other countries, excess capacities and intense competition are putting pressure on margins.", "This may delay structural change in the real economy which requires a reallocation of resources from shrinking to growing sectors.", "For the financial sector itself, digitalization implies a significant structural change.", "The financial system, at the same time, contributes to risk sharing in an economy.", "The public debate on the issue tends to focus on mechanisms of fiscal risk sharing, which are politically sensitive.", "This debate overlooks that there are unexploited potentials for improv- ing risk sharing via financial markets - particularly with regard to international risk sharing.", "Better risk sharing does not imply calling the European bank-based financial system into question.", "Rather, it is about finding a good mix between debt and equity finance, between financing via banks and markets.", "This contributes to an improved allocation of risks across the financial system and to its resilience.", "This is because profits of corporate firms or of banks automatically accrue to the owners of these firms who, in turn, also bear potential losses.", "Claims of creditors, by contrast, do not depend on the economic success of a firm, and they bear losses only if the firm in question becomes insolvent.", "Equity capital can, in addition, make a special contribution to the financing of young and innovative firms.", "Despite all the differences between the German and the French financial systems, markets for venture capital remain underdeveloped in both countries, as they are in other parts of Europe.", "Which specific measures can enhance the contribution of financial markets to growth, in- novation, and stability?", "The Capital Markets Union - a project which was launched about two years ago - provides answers to this question.", "Reforming insolvency legislation and - where relevant - harmonizing rules can contribute to cross-border investments and to dealing with non-performing loans.", "Minimum harmoni- zation in terms of the collection of collateral and in terms of creditor rights can be useful in this regard, particularly as it would make shifting losses ex post more difficult.", "Moreover, the Capital Markets Union can contribute to relaxing financial constraints so that strong small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups obtain access to finance.", "International investment can be attracted by harmonizing investor protection legislation within the EU and removing barriers to cross-border mergers and acquisitions.", "Central banks in Europe have been supportive of the Capital Markets Union project, as it can contribute to growth while, at the same time, enhancing the resilience and stability of the financial system.", "Enhancing dialogue Explaining reforms implemented so far, assessing their effects, and drawing the right con- clusions can succeed only through a dialogue between relevant stakeholders.", "Communi- cation has a special dimension in the euro area because the euro is a \u201ecurrency without a state\".", "The Eurosystem needs to ensure that citizens in all member states are well in- formed about issues relating to central banks.", "Within the Eurosystem, central banks are politically independent and have a clear man- date: ensuring price stability.", "Together with other institutions, they play an important role in banking supervision and in ensuring the stability of the financial system.", "Central bank independence is confined to the mandate of central banks.", "It must, in turn, be shielded from political interference.", "This interference can be indirect if, for example, high levels of private or public debt put pressure on central banks to come to the rescue in times of crises and to assume risks.", "This may, in extreme cases, put price and financial stability at risk.", "Stable democratic institutions are the backbone of economic growth, employment, and in- vestment.", "And they enable central banks to perform their tasks - i.e.", "to ensure price and financial stability.", "At the same time, price stability and financial stability support democratic institutions.", "These, in turn, need to provide the institutional framework necessary to ensure that cen- tral banks can fulfil their mandate and are protected from direct and indirect political inter- ference.", "In this sense, central banks are independent, but they do not operate in a political vacu- um.", "Instead, the mandate of central banks is the result of a political decision making pro- cess.", "Within the limits of their mandate, central banks can take the decisions they consid- er appropriate.", "This implies, however, that central bank policies need to be explained to the general public, to be transparent and comprehensible.", "In addition, central banks in the euro area need to maintain a close dialogue with each other.", "What are the concrete contributions of central banks to this dialogue?", "Public communication: Over the past decades, central banks have become significantly more open and transparent.", "There is continuous communication with market participants, policymakers, academics and, not least, the general public via the media.", "Economic education: Central banks have, over recent years, expanded their work in the field of economic education and financial literacy.", "The Banque de France has, for exam- ple, set up a museum explaining money and monetary policy (Cite\u0301 de l'e\u0301conomie et de la monnaie).", "In December 2016, the Bundesbank has reopened its redesigned money mu- seum.", "Similar activities across the network of European central banks are highly wel- come.", "Staff-level exchange programs: Staff-level exchange programs between the Bundesbank and the Banque de France have been in place for several years now.", "Today, we are glad to welcome 20 German und 14 French participants of such exchange programs to this conference.", "Ensuring more diversity and promoting equal opportunity employment can further contribute to an improved internal and external dialogue.", "Joint projects: The joint spring conference between the Bundesbank and the Banque de France has been a successful form of cooperation between the two institutions for many years now.", "Many other joint initiatives can be mentioned as well -
