expected.", "It continues to be restrained by the consolidation of household balance sheets and slow growth in employment.", "\uf0b7 While growth in core Europe has been stronger than expected, necessary fiscal austerity measures in a number of countries will restrain growth over the projection horizon.", "In Japan, the economy has begun to recover from the disasters that struck on 11 March, but the level of economic activity will remain below previous expectations.", "\uf0b7 In contrast, growth in emerging-market economies, particularly China, remains very strong.", "As a consequence, commodity prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, following recent declines.", "These high prices, combined with persistent excess demand in major emerging-market economies, are contributing to broader global inflationary pressures.", "\uf0b7 Widespread concerns over sovereign debt have increased risk aversion and volatility in financial markets.", "The Bank's projection assumes that authorities are able to contain the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, although there are clear risks around this outcome.", "\uf0b7 In Canada, the economic expansion is proceeding largely as

expected to remain strong, household spending to grow more in line with disposable income, and net exports to become more supportive of growth.", "\uf0b7 Relative to the April projection, growth in household spending is now projected to be slightly firmer, reflecting higher household income, and net exports to be slightly weaker, reflecting more subdued U.S. activity.", "\uf0b7 Overall, the Bank projects the economy will expand by 2.8 per cent in 2011, 2.6 per cent in 2012, and 2.1 per cent in 2013, returning to capacity in the middle of \uf0b7 In the near term, total CPI inflation is expected to remain above 3 per cent, largely reflecting temporary factors such as significantly higher food and energy prices.", "It is expected to return to the 2 per cent target by the middle of

expected to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon.", "\uf0b7 Although the global outlook remains broadly unchanged, global risks have intensified, most notably in Europe.", "The three main upside risks to inflation in Canada relate to the possibility of higher-than-projected commodity prices and global inflation, stronger momentum in Canadian household spending, and the possibility
