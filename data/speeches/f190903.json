system is in a range of stability whenever it is capable of facilitating the performance of an economy, and of dissipating financial imbalances that arise endogenously or as a result of significant adverse and unanticipated events .", "The Global Context 3.", "The global approach to financial stability changed significantly after the financial crisis of 2008 which made it abundantly clear that

different regulators, the institutional mechanisms of the Financial Stability Development Council (FSDC), under the Chairmanship of the Finance Minister, and the FSDC sub-committee, under the chairmanship of Governor, Reserve Bank, have been fully functional.", "The biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR), a report of FSDC sub-committee, analyses the current state of financial system, the extent of interconnectedness among its various segments and possible sources of vulnerabilities that could impact domestic financial stability.", "The headwinds to financial stability could emanate from various sectors of the economy, namely, (i) the credit market; (ii) financial markets; (iii) external sector; and (iv) payment system.", "It may emanate from some other sources as well.",

and based on its recommendations, the Reserve Bank proposes to carry out necessary changes in the regulatory architecture for CICs.", "We are also in the process of building a specialised regulatory and supervisory cadre for regulation and supervision of banks and nonbanks.", "Another important issue in this context is the immediate need to strengthen corporate governance structure in banks,

Stability 22.", "With increased trade and financial linkages with rest of the world, India has become more susceptible to the vagaries of heightened global economic uncertainties.", "While trade channels take some time to show a tangible impact of global shocks, it is the financial and confidence channels that quickly transmit the global shocks as was evident in the case of India during the taper tantrum period in mid-2013.", "In fact with negative and low interest rates in major economies, net private capital flows to EMEs in the form of direct and portfolio investments have nearly doubled in the post-crisis period.", "However, with high monetary policy uncertainties in advanced economies, these flows have proved to be fluid and therefore posed considerable risk to EMEs.", "Just a year back, EMEs like India faced financial market turbulence due to a faster-than-expected tightening in monetary policies in advanced economies.", "Many EMEs including India witnessed portfolio capital outflows, exerting downward pressure on domestic currencies.", "In recent years, India's external sector has benefited from a sustainable level of current account deficit, largely financed by robust foreign direct investment inflows and flexible exchange rate policy.", "Improvement in other vulnerability indicators during 2018-19 such as fall in external debt to GDP ratio (from 20.1 per cent at end-March 2018 to 19.7 per cent at end-March 2019) and debt service ratio (from 7.5 per cent at end-March 2018 to 6.4 per cent at end-March 2019) also augur well for mitigating the spill over

minimise spill overs of global shocks and preserve financial stability.", "As a supplementary safeguard, the Reserve Bank has signed a bilateral currency swap agreement with the Bank of Japan for US$

services space, including FinTech and BigTech firms are altering the universe of financial service providers.", "A range of new lending platforms, including P2P and marketplace lenders, have appeared in jurisdictions around the world.", "Highlighting some of the related challenges and opportunities, the recent Annual Economic Report of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) states that such firms can collect large amount of data at nearly zero costs, which can be used to better assess the riskiness of borrowers and could reduce the need for collateral to assure repayment.", "These new players have also made inroads in the provision of payment services, remittance services and crossborder payments.", "Moreover, they have the potential to grow very quickly and become large and systemically important financial institutions, raising concerns over financial stability and consumer protection.", "Faced with such profound changes, the policy makers' dilemma is more than walking the middle path between innovation and regulation.", "The public policy approach here needs to be more comprehensive and holistic, taking into account issues such as financial regulation, competition policy and data privacy regulation.", "Coordination among various authorities - such as financial regulators, competition authorities and data protection supervisors - becomes critical at this juncture.", "The Reserve Bank's Vision-2021 for Payment and Settlement Systems in India visualises empowering every Indian with access to a bouquet of e-payment options that is safe, secure, convenient, quick and affordable.", "The Committee on Deepening of Digital Payments under the chairmanship of Shri Nandan Nilekani has suggested to increase the volume of digital payments by 10 times in the next three years which can be facilitated by initiatives such as removing transaction charges on digital payments, simplifying KYC processes, and reducing KYC costs for banks.", "The Reserve Bank is taking necessary action based on the committee's recommendations.", "Concluding Observations 28.", "At the end, I would like to highlight the significance of consumer protection which is not only important from the point of view of access but also from a broader context of stakeholders' trust.", "The trust of the consumers that the services are fairly priced, the trust of the investors that the stakeholders are acting in their best collective interest, the trust of the regulators that the audited financial statements do represent a fair and reasonable assessment of the activities of a firm - all have intangible but substantial contribution to national savings and financial stability.", "Post Lehman developments in the US financial markets are a prime and sobering example of what happens when investor trust evaporates.", "In fact, consumer protection should be seen as a key pivot around which all regulatory and supervisory initiatives are required to evolve.", "Let me conclude by saying that much progress has been made in maintaining a stable financial system.", "However, as we have seen, the financial landscape is continuously changing, and new challenges are emerging.", "The Reserve Bank is continuously harnessing the regulatory and supervisory framework to better adapt to the evolving scenario.", "The IBA, its members and other stakeholders should, therefore, be active partners in ensuring that such a process evolves successfully.", "Financial Stability Report, June 2019, Reserve Bank of India."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
