consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 percent over time.", "Monetary policy is at the same time flexible in that our interest rate setting also takes developments in output and employment into consideration.", "The key policy rate was lowered to 0.5 percent in March 2016 and has since been kept unchanged.", "The key policy rate is low because interest rates abroad are low, while capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is below a normal level and the forces driving inflation are moderate.", "Low growth and the risk of deflation in the global economy have brought down interest rates among Norway's trading partners to a very low level.", "Chart: Global and trading partner GDP Growth in the global economy has gradually slowed in recent years and was in 2016 at its lowest

recent years, and exports of traditional manufactured finished products have shown an appreciable increase.", "However, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for a decrease in exports from other sectors of the mainland economy.", "Total mainland exports were lower last year than in 2014.", "The most important reason for this is the marked decrease in oil service industry exports in the

exports Weak export growth partly reflects supply-side constraints in some sectors.", "Production stoppages at several large companies led to a decrease in industrial commodity exports last year,

that unemployment is falling both in oil-dependent regions and in the rest of the country.", "At the same time, employment growth has been modest, and some of the decline in unemployment is the result of labour market withdrawal.", "Looking ahead, there are prospects that employment will increase as growth in the mainland economy picks up, partly driven by mainland corporate investment, which seems to be picking up.", "Oil investment is also expected to show a moderate upswing as from next year.", "Export growth is also likely to pick up, supported by growth among Norway's trading partners.", "At the same time, there is reason to expect less fiscal stimulus ahead.", "The Government has adjusted the fiscal rule for oil revenue spending.", "Oil revenue spending over time is required to

Inflation The inflation target has anchored inflation expectations.", "At the same time, there has been sufficient room for flexibility and the exercise of judgement to enable monetary policy to dampen the impact on output and employment when the economy has been exposed to shocks.", "Our experience has shown us the crucial importance of flexibility in inflation targeting to enable us to make the appropriate trade-offs in response to these shocks.", "The time horizon for achieving the target must be sufficiently long, and the balance of risks, including risks related to financial stability, must be taken into account.", "We have also experienced the important role the exchange rate has played as shock absorber, particularly during the financial crisis and in periods of falling oil prices.", "At the same time, the interest rate level abroad places limitations on the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy in a small open economy such as Norway.", "Monetary policy's main task
