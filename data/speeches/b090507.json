heightened risk aversion has massively reduced capital flows into emerging economies; export revenues have fallen as a result of declining trade volumes and commodity prices; remittances - normally a countercyclical factor in poor countries - seem to show a reversal in their multiyear upward trend.", "The Bank response to the crisis The World Bank Group (WBG) has promptly responded to the growing financial needs of its client countries by scaling-up its development assistance and leveraging its own resources with those from other public and private donors.", "President Zoellick has pledged to bring new IBRD loans from $13bn to $35bn in the current fiscal year and up to $100bn over the period spanning fiscal years 2009 to 2011.", "Over the same period, IFC plans to fully leverage its capital base by raising its loans to $12bn per year.", "The WBG response to the financial crisis has also led to the development of the Vulnerability Framework (VF), a well-conceived platform intended to provide donors with an ample choice of multilateral development institutions and facilities to channel development funds.", "The support to trade finance, as envisaged in the VF, will help timely counteract the sharp contraction in trade volumes that emerged in recent months.", "The VF is well positioned to play an important countercyclical role, backing countries currently cut off from capital markets with additional finance.", "At the same time it is important that all new resources falling under the VF umbrella meet standards of accountability, oversight and evaluation as rigorous as those governing the use of WBG funds.", "More broadly, short-term public budget relief (through fast-disbursing Development Policy Operations) must be strictly and verifiably targeted to restoring fiscal space for essential social needs (Health, Education, Nutrition);
