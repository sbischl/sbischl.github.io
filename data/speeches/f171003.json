the nexus between magnifying the benefits of access to finance and managing the excesses of finance.", "There are moral and ethical considerations that regulators and policymakers will have to confront as we go forward.", "Four possible future scenarios Let us conceptualise these themes into four scenarios, an approach that could provide a peek into what is in store, as we visualise the future.", "The first scenario is \"Tech-Savvy Incumbents\" a.", "The pace of technology adoption by incumbent banks is high, while level of fragmentation among finance providers is low.", "This is a more ambitious, albeit possible, scenario where banks successfully adopt the best strategies and emerge as the dominant winner in all finance segments; b.", "Here we see banks as incumbent institutions responding quickly to technology shifts, realigning their business processes and delivery channels to meet customer expectations.", "They succeed in nurturing both tech-literate management personnel and digitally-savvy c. Emerging tech firms remain important sources of innovation but are acquired by the incumbents.", "As a result, these institutions can successfully retain and expand their customer base; and d. In this scenario, although we will not see a dramatic change in terms of players in our financial system, the functions and ways in which they conduct businesses will be dramatically different.", "The second scenario is \"Plugged-in Finance\" a.", "Both technology adoption by incumbent banks and fragmentation among finance providers are high.", "Finance is marked by an ecosystem of \"co-dependence\" between banks and tech start-ups that target specific, profitable segments of the market rather than the whole suite of financial services; b.", "The resulting partnership is one that is both rich and dynamic.", "Fintech startups leverage on banks for regulatory compliance and access to customer base, while banks allow them to 'plug-into' their business as a swift means of acquiring technology; c. This collaborative model is made possible by the application of new technologies such as distributed ledger and open API across a wide range of financial services; d. Consumers and businesses will have access to highly competitive and efficient financial services, driven by both scale and adoption of technological innovations; and e. In this scenario, greater financial education and literacy is important to ensure that the benefits of technology and innovation in the financial sector are fully realised.", "The third scenario is \"New Kids on the Block\" a.", "In this scenario, both technology adoption by incumbent banks and fragmentation among finance providers are relatively low; b.", "Consumers continue to accord a premium to regulated institutions and the existing idea of financial services being offered by a bank; c. Factors such as security, privacy and reliability remain at the forefront of the value proposition of traditional banks.", "However, not all incumbent banks are able to fully bridge the technology gap, particularly for newer services; d. This results in migration towards digitally-focused challenger banks such as Atom, Fidor and Monzo that will provide similar services of traditional banks, but utilise technology to deliver faster and cheaper services that better meet the needs of customers; and e. The implication of this is that the landscape of finance will remain largely filed by banks, but a new breed of purely digital banks will gain in significance.", "The names that we immediately think of for financial services will change from the current banks that we are so familiar with.", "The fourth scenario is what I call 'the Tech take-over' a.", "Like scenario one, this is a more extreme and less probable scenario, but still one that is worth a thought.", "In this scenario, technology adoption by incumbent banks is low, with a high level of fragmentation among finance providers; b.", "However, in contrast to scenario three, technology firms enter as the new preferred provider, successfully capturing the loyalty of consumers due to superior ability in using data to deliver customer-centric solutions; c. Financial services will thus be offered via a wide range of providers such as social networks (e.g.", "Facebook, Wechat) and e-commerce platforms (e.g.", "Amazon, Alibaba); and d. Growing comfort with the ability of technology to ensure secured transactions also gives rise to the popularity of peer-to-peer financial services.", "Implications to BNM as a regulator These scenarios I have painted are drawn to show the distinct characteristics of a financial sector across four possible scenarios.", "It could be one of them, a combination or none of the above.", "Regardless of which scenario might eventually emerge, perhaps the most important realisation for stakeholders today is to be aware, ready and prepared for all the scenarios.", "In reality, what is even more likely though, is that the dynamic interplay between these scenarios will end up shaping the future of finance in ways that we cannot even fathom today.", "Interestingly, we are already seeing some elements of all four scenarios in our financial system today.", "To my mind, scenarios one and four are remotely possible, while scenarios two and three are considerably probable.", "For regulators, as the four scenarios highlighted, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that banks, in its current form, might no longer exist.", "This phenomenon not only negates the main intermediation channel of central banks' monetary policy, it will also challenge central banks in terms of rethinking the means to regulate, supervise and safeguard overall financial stability and the manner in which scarce economic resources are allocated and intermediated.", "As data becomes the driving force of financial services, the central bank must keep abreast with the latest thinking to harness the power of big data.", "The challenge for central banks however, is to filter out noises from the mass of data and extract meaningful information that will assist in better policy-making.", "The Bank has embarked on a journey to adopt big data and analytics across all functions of the organisation.", "This includes establishing a dedicated statistics team to drive this agenda, enhancing the capabilities of staff and exploring new areas and methods of data collection.", "We continuously strategise to 'future-proof' the financial system through our policies, frameworks and initiatives.", "Three principles are worth mentioning; a. Firstly, we will continue to strongly advocate for the adoption of technology to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and resiliency of the financial sector.", "Our FinTech sandbox and Financial Technology Enabler Group is an example of this.", "This also reflects our philosophy that innovations work best through collaboration between the industry and policymakers; b. Secondly, as a regulator and trustee of the financial sector, we will remain focused on ensuring that the financial sector is inclusive for all segments of society and contributes effectively and positively to the economic growth and development of the nation; and c. Thirdly, we will continue to ensure that financial stability and consumer trust and confidence are preserved at all times.", "These are the cornerstones of the central bank's role and functions and the adoption of any policies, past or future, will continue to have an unbreakable link to these objectives.", "Finance has come a long way- from serving the basic societal needs to save and borrow at its infancy to its role today as the backbone of the global economy.", "In ancient days, kings and rulers look to astronomers, magicians and soothsayers to tell them about the future.", "The Greeks for example, consulted the Oracle at Delphi before embarking on major decisions.", "The world today is much wiser I hope, and we no longer believe that the future can be predicted with absolute certainty.", "What finance and technology can bring for the future of human kind is so exciting that it can go beyond containment.", "Yet if left on its own, the outcome can be perilous.", "Resisting them, however, is not an option.", "While we embrace them as they synthesise and evolve, we also need to shape and control them such that they would not lead us to face extreme financial market fragilities and devastation.", "In the words of Nassim Taleb, we need to make ourselves \"antifragile\" - not only able to withstand shocks, disruptions and volatility but able to position ourselves to take advantage of it.", "But I always like the quote by Peter Drucker, \"The best way to predict the future, is to create it.\""], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Finance democratization", "Data utilization", "Winner-takes-all dynamics", "Consumer expectations", "Financial inclusion", "Ethical considerations", "Tech-savvy incumbents", "Plugged-in finance", "New kids on the block", "Tech take-over"]}
