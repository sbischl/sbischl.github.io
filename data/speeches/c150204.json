1) uneven global growth and 2) divergent monetary policies in advanced economies.", "As the US economic growth continued to gain traction and the US Fed subsequently ended its asset purchase program in October last year, markets began to interpret the Fed's statements to mean that it would begin \"lift off\" (or raise the Fed Funds target rate) sometime this year.", "In contrast, EU and Japan remained barely able to eke out growth.", "By the ECB's and the BOJ's own pronouncements, they were willing to further expand easy monetary conditions to stimulate growth in their jurisdictions.", "ECB President Mario Draghi even pledged to do \"whatever it takes\".", "So, in one part of the globe, you had the Fed poised to tighten monetary conditions, and in another, you had the ECB and BOJ committing to provide more liquidity as needed.", "This combination ushered the shift in market sentiment -
