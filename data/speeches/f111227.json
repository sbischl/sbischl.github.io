growth with equity in the backdrop of financial stability.", "Recent amendments carried to various financial sector laws Before I delve into some of the key issues requiring legislative review, I list some of the enactments and amendments that have been made to the various Acts during the last decade to highlight the dynamic nature of legislation.", "Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 was amended in 2006 to provide legality to certain OTC derivative transactions and also to give explicit regulatory powers to Reserve Bank over derivatives and money market instruments.", "The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 was amended in 2007 for removing the lower limit prescribed in maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) by banks and conferring wide powers on RBI in stipulating the SLR requirements for banks and to control liquidity in the market.", "The State Bank of India Act, 1955 was amended in 2007 for enabling transfer of ownership from RBI to Government of India and again in 2010 to provide for enhancement of capital, issue of preference shares, raise capital by public issue or preferential allotment or private placement or rights issue; and to issue bonus shares to the existing shareholders, etc.", "The State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 was amended in 2007 to facilitate enhancement of capital, raise resources from the market and raise capital through rights issue.", "v.

framed by the Reserve Bank and to raise capital by preferential allotment or private placement or public issue, with the approval of the Reserve Bank.", "The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was amended in 2002 to introduce the concepts of \"electronic cheque\" and \"cheque truncation\" by expanding the definition of \"cheque\".", "The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2007 was passed with a view to providing a legal framework for enabling listing and trading of securitised debt instruments, including mortgage backed debt.", "The Government Securities Act, 2006 was enacted

of crime, setting up of agencies and mechanisms for co-ordinating measures for combating money laundering, etc.", "The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010 was enacted by repealing the erstwhile Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 mainly to rectify several deficiencies found in the previous Act.", "The new Act covers the electronic media and organizations, other than political

which are constituted under different statutes are governed by their respective statutes and by some of the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act.", "The provisions relating to the ownership and management of banking companies as contained in the Banking Regulation Act are not applicable to the public sector banks.", "Co-operative Banks are constituted by the respective State Co-operative Societies Acts or by the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act and the provisions of Banking Regulation Act are made applicable to them with certain modifications.", "Since the origins of the banks have been historically different, they continue to be governed by the respective statutes as well as other general laws.", "Each of the statutes was crafted in a contemporaneous setting, reflecting the needs and concerns of the time.", "Therefore, almost all the statutes were amended from time to time to reflect changes in circumstances and context prevailing at that time.", "There is a strong case for reviewing these legislations and recasting them for a number of reasons.", "First, prudential regulations are ownership neutral.", "However, the fact that different banks are governed by different laws has resulted in an uneven playing field which needs to be addressed.", "For example, while amendments were carried out to enable SBI, SBI subsidiary banks and nationalised banks to issue preference shares, though at different points of time, banks in private sector cannot issue preference shares as the amendments to the BR Act is still to be carried out.", "Similarly, while bilateral netting in the event of liquidation is admissible for private sector banks governed by the Companies Act and the normal bankruptcy laws, the position in this regard for public sector banks, SBI and its subsidiaries is not clear in law, as liquidation, if at all, of such banks would be as per the Notification to be issued by the Government in this regard.", "Second, a single, harmonized and uniform legislation applicable to all banks will provide transparency, comprehensiveness and clarity and provide ease of regulation and supervision to the Reserve Bank.", "Third, there is also a need to sort out the conflicts and overlaps between the primary laws governing the banking sector and other applicable laws.", "For example, the Competition Act, 2002 (as amended by the Competition

these powers may not be effective in handling a situation where supersession of the Board is warranted.", "RBI, currently, does not have the power to supersede the Board of Directors of a banking company.", "In the Banking Laws Amendment Bill, 2011 amendments are being proposed for conferring such a power on RBI, for being used with appropriate safeguards.", "With respect to public sector banks, by way of amendments, similar powers have been vested in the Central Government, which has the majority shareholding in those banks.", "The shareholding pattern also plays a vital role with respect to the management of banks and, therefore, it is necessary that shareholders having sizeable holding should also be fit and proper.", "RBI has, by way of regulatory prescriptions, implemented an acknowledgement procedure.", "In the 2011 Bill, statutory provisions are being proposed for obtaining prior permission of RBI for acquiring 5% or more of the equity shares or voting rights in a banking company.", "At present, a deadlock situation arises if a group of persons acquires sizeable equity or voting rights in a bank without following the acknowledgement procedure.", "There is no statutory power for directing disgorgement of shares and as such, if any such acquisition takes place, it may result only in contravention in provisions of BR Act.", "The main object of preventing the management of a bank from being captured by persons who are not fit and proper for holding such sizeable interest will not be achieved.", "RBI should, therefore, have the power to direct, by order, at any time that persons who are not fit and proper to hold such equity or voting power in contravention of these provisions, shall not have voting power.", "The 2011 Bill proposes to confer such power on RBI.", "This will help prevent unscrupulous persons from exercising control over banks.", "Deposit collection activity Currently, collection of deposits from members/shareholders is not treated as acceptance of public deposits.", "This is a matter of serious concern, particularly, with respect to Co-operative Societies.", "Deposits are accepted by enrolling members on tap and by collecting nominal amounts from them, exposing such depositors to serious risks.", "Banking Regulation Act does not apply to such co-operative societies and they are outside the regulatory purview of the Reserve Bank.", "It is necessary to plug this important loophole.", "Unless deposits are received from members who have voting rights, the deposits have to be treated as public deposits and the exemption from the provisions of Banking Regulation Act should not be made applicable.", "Every entity that accepts deposits from persons having no voting rights has to be treated as deposit accepting entity and should be regulated as such by RBI.", "RBI should have the discretion to determine the level and intensity of regulation and supervision depending upon the risk to the system from such entities.", "Financial conglomerates In India, banks are entitled to carry on certain financial activities under the bank subsidiary model.", "Some banks have formed subsidiaries to carry on securities and insurance business.", "The performance of the subsidiaries affects the balance sheet of the bank.", "On account of varied activities carried on by the entities in the group which fall within the regulatory jurisdiction of multiple regulators, the risk to the system as a whole posed by such financial conglomerates is difficult to assess.", "These raise systemic issues and RBI as the regulator of banks needs to be empowered to obtain information, with respect to each of the entities functioning under the umbrella of a bank.", "The 2011 Bill proposes to confer such powers on RBI to get information with respect to such entities.", "This ought to be pursued in the new legislative framework also.", "Non-operative bank holding company The traditional theories of economies of scale and scope support bigger entities.", "In India, we need bigger banks to finance our very large infrastructure needs and also large industrial projects.", "Thus, while there are advantages in growing big and handling multiple activities, nobody knows where exactly the tipping point is, when the bigness of size starts becoming a disadvantage.", "The crisis has highlighted the downside of having \"Too Big to Fail\" entities.", "Very big and complex entities pose supervisory issues to the regulators and pose serious systemic risks.", "So we need to ensure that structures are not complex and that there are effective resolution mechanisms to ensure orderly winding up of these systemically important entities, in case of crisis.", "It has been suggested that a non-operative bank holding company structure may be useful to deal with financial conglomerates as this greatly mitigates the risks spilling over from other entities in the Group.", "While the functional regulator of each subsidiary of the non-operative holding company may regulate and supervise the business of the subsidiary concerned, the non-operative holding company needs to be regulated on the lines of a bank and needs to be placed under the regulatory and supervisory control of RBI.", "Appropriate legislative measures are necessary for operationalising this model.", "Apart from the regulatory issues in the above model, there are other challenges to be addressed.", "One of them is related to placing public sector banks under such holding companies.", "Another is the impact of taxation on the transfer of shares of the subsidiaries to the holding company.", "Unless adequate tax relief is granted, it will be difficult for existing banks to come under the holding company structure.", "Stamp duty issues In India, there are certain issues with respect to stamp duty on documents.", "One of the major hurdles facing the development of the securitisation market is the stamp duty structure.", "It can add up to a substantial cost as there are differentiated duty structures in different states.", "While some states have recognised the special nature of securitization transactions and reduced the stamp duties, other states still operate at stamp duties as high as 5% to 12% for transfer of secured receivables.", "Concerns about stamp duties have also been raised in the context of the proposed subsidiarisation of foreign banks.", "The broader objective of proposed subsidiarisation of foreign banks is to promote financial stability in India and this requires harmonisation and simplification of stamp duty structure across the country.", "Minimum capital requirements The minimum capital prescribed in the Banking Regulation Act for banks is too low and Reserve Bank is prescribing the minimum capital requirement in case of private sector banks from time to time (currently banks should have a minimum networth of Rs.", "Minimum capital requirements prescribed under the \"Ownership and Governance\" guidelines and that prescribed/ being prescribed for new banks in private sector are way above the current provisions of the Act.", "It would, therefore, be more appropriate to empower Reserve Bank to stipulate the capital requirements and other quantitative parameters from time to time, instead of prescribing quantitative limits in the respective Acts.", "Migration to IFRS As part of the efforts to ensure convergence of the Indian Accounting Standards (IAS) with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the formats of financial statements will undergo changes consequent to the introduction of IFRS.", "Further, whenever banks introduce new types of capital instruments, etc.", "these will have to be appropriately incorporated in the format.", "Therefore, Reserve Bank should be empowered to prescribe the format of the balance sheet, profit and loss account, etc.", "given in Third Schedule of the B. R. Act.", "Bilateral netting issues Various banks had requested RBI to allow bilateral netting of counterparty credit exposure, in respect of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, and gold.", "The legal position regarding bilateral netting is not unambiguously clear in case of banks established by special statutes [like SBI Act, Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, etc.].", "Amendments to a large number of enactments particularly in a synchronised manner may be practically difficult.", "Enacting a single legislation which covers all aspects of banks' functioning, while possibly providing differential legislative framework for corporate governance issues on account of ownership differences may make the legislative framework more efficient.", "The significance of effective resolution mechanism for promoting financial stability as well as consumer protection cannot be underestimated.", "The legal framework should address the resolution mechanism from a practical point of view and must have at least the following characteristics: \uf0b7 Early intervention before insolvency \uf0b7 Speed of intervention/resolution \uf0b7 Ability to transfer or merge operations \uf0b7 Effective write-down of shareholders' rights \uf0b7 Protection of on-going business In addition to banks, the resolution mechanism should address resolution of other Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) also.", "Post crisis, globally, there have been initiatives to strengthen the resolution framework of Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) and other entities in the financial sector.", "The resolution mechanism should also include a framework for resolution of NBFCs and entities operating payment systems.", "Swift and simple procedure for quick resolution, particularly, that of systemically important entities - global and domestic, is necessary.", "Under the evolving international framework it would be required of jurisdictions, to have adequate resolution framework as per international standards.", "The key attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes were adopted by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary and endorsed by G-20 leaders at the Cannes Summit and these are an essential component of the package of policies to reduce the risks of moral hazard and the potential for systemic disruption associated with Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs).", "This will require legislative changes and administrative actions.", "The powers of RBI for effective resolution of regulated entities from this perspective need enhancement.", "Voluntary mergers and transfers help consolidation in financial sector and pave the way for stronger financial institutions to rescue the weaker ones.", "Such voluntary measures, while saving the constituents of weaker institutions, provide business opportunity to the stronger ones to spread their presence in different geographies.", "The BR Act empowers RBI to sanction a scheme for voluntary amalgamation of banking companies.", "However, such a power is not available with respect to cooperative banks.", "Considering the challenges faced in quick resolution of failed cooperative banks, certain enabling provisions in the BR Act facilitating RBI to sanction a scheme for takeover of banking assets and liabilities of a cooperative bank by commercial banks would be desirable.", "Partial merger of certain businesses or assets and liabilities of banks also may need to be examined.", "One of the issues that could complicate the resolution of banks through mergers and transfers due to the sensitivity of the process is the applicability of competition law.", "An enterprise proposing to enter into a combination via a merger or an amalgamation is required to notify the Competition Commission, and the Commission has been allowed up to 210 days to decide on it before the default clause kicks in.", "The 2011 Bill tries to address this issue.", "Consumer protection and globally compatible secrecy laws For speedy redressal of consumer grievances, RBI has framed the Banking Ombudsman Scheme by statutory directions under the BR Act.", "The Scheme is working satisfactorily.", "Secrecy of customer information is a principle of common law which is practiced in India also by banks, and recognized by courts.", "Statutory basis for this has to be provided, by clearly setting forth the exceptions relevant to the present requirement of preventing money laundering and cross border financing of undesirable activities.", "The law should strike a balance between the privacy rights of the customer and the need to share crucial information with law enforcement agencies and other regulators, both domestic and foreign.", "In matters of crime and proceeds of crime, the larger public interest would outweigh the private interests of individuals.", "Appropriate amendments may have to be carried out in the BR Act to provide a statutory backing for the banking secrecy laws and the limits on the privacy of customers should be laid down.", "Protection is required in the law to the regulators with respect to the information collected from the regulated entities including its assessment and analysis made by the regulators or supervisors and the correspondence related to such information.", "In larger public interest, the law should enable sharing of information with other regulators, both domestic and overseas, for mutual benefit.", "The recent crisis has demonstrated the need for such cooperation.", "The absence of specific protection to the information held by the regulators whether collected from the regulated entities or from other regulators impedes sharing of information.", "Our laws have to be globally compatible and specific exemption from disclosure needs to be provided in this regard.", "Disclosure of sensitive information could compromise the effectiveness of regulation and supervision.", "Further, unless the secrecy laws in our jurisdiction are compatible with global standards, it will not be possible to receive from, or share information with, overseas regulators.", "Appropriate provisions may have to be inserted in the RBI Act and the BR Act in this regard.", "Conclusion Financial sector is a very important segment of the economy and has direct bearing on growth and prosperity.", "Strong financial systems need strong legal systems which provide unambiguous and fair legislation.", "The financial system in India including banking, insurance, capital, taxation,
