Knight and A Treatise on Probability by the British economist John M. Keynes.", "Both of them make distinctions between risks, which can be measured by normal statistical probability, and \"true,\" fundamental uncertainties, which cannot be explained by probability theory and thus are unmeasurable.", "They both emphasize the importance of true uncertainties in economic society.", "It seems that such uncertainties remain with regard to and its impact on the economy.", "In my speech today, while focusing on uncertainties, I will first outline the current situation of and outlook for Japan's economy, and then explain the challenges for central banks today, including the thinking behind central bank efforts to address climate change.", "Lastly, I will talk about recent and future economic activity in Hiroshima Prefecture.", "Current Situation of and Outlook for Japan's Economy A.", "Economic Developments and Mechanism for Recovery Let me start with economic developments.", "Domestic and overseas economies have experienced significantly large changes since last year, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, and it is more necessary than before to carefully interpret various economic indicators.", "With this in mind, let me explain the current situation of Japan's economy.", "The economy has remained in a severe state, mainly for the household sector, due to downward pressure stemming from (Chart 1).", "The real GDP growth rate, which excludes the effects of price fluctuations, was negative for the quarter of 2021, mainly because of a decline in private consumption.", "Thereafter, the rate for the quarter remained more or less flat and real GDP is still below the level.", "That said, the Bank judges that the trend in the economy as a whole has been maintained, supported by positive developments in the corporate sector on the back of a firm recovery in overseas economies.", "Regarding the outlook, positive developments are likely to spread from the corporate sector to the household sector as the impact of wanes gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and the economic recovery is expected to become clear.", "The key to realizing this outlook is whether a virtuous cycle operates firmly; in other words, whether an increase in domestic and overseas demand expands household income and corporate profits, and in turn leads to a further rise in spending (Chart 2).", "Looking back at the past period of deflation, a vicious cycle continued, in that households and firms became reluctant to consume or invest and postponed spending, which consequently decreased income and led to a further decline in spending.", "This vicious cycle ended with the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in 2013.", "Thereafter, Specifically, attention should be paid to the following points: (1) the base effects, in which a rebound from the previous year's significant declines in economic activity and price levels arithmetically gives high economic growth and inflation rates this year, and (2) the compositional effects, in which average wages apparently heighten since workers with relatively low wages become unemployed.", "These effects have been seen in other countries, as have been referred to in the following speech: Bailey, A., \"It's a Recovery, but Not as We Know It,\" speech given at the Mansion House, July 1, 2021, -bailey-speech -at-the-mansion-house-financial-professional-services-event.", "amid a virtuous cycle operating between income and spending, Japan's economy has managed to avoid falling into deflation.", "However, this positive economic cycle has halted temporarily since last spring due to a new shock that is putting strong downward pressure on economic activity.", "I will now talk about the corporate and household sectors, first by looking at the current situation of income and spending and then the outlook for each sector.", "Current Situation of the Corporate and Household Sectors In the corporate sector, profits which are firms' income have improved on the whole, although weakness has been seen in some industries such as services (Chart 3).", "The Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry, Quarterly (FSSC) show that current profits for all industries and enterprises have already exceeded the level for the quarter of 2021.", "This is because Japan's exports pre-pandemic January-March and production have increased steadily as the global economy has recovered on the whole, albeit with unevenness.", "In the United States and Europe, public health measures have been lifted in stages on the back of progress with vaccinations, and therefore a recovery in economic activity has become evident, including for services consumption, which had been constrained.", "This recovery in the U.S. and European economies together with the Chinese economy's recovery, which has happened ahead of theirs has had positive effects on the global economy through trade.", "Under these circumstances, business fixed investment which is firms' spending has picked up in Japan, led by machinery investment by the manufacturing industry.", "Business fixed investment plans in the Bank's Tankan Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) show that investment is expected to see a solid increase for fiscal 2021.", "These factors suggest that, in the corporate sector, a virtuous cycle from profits to business fixed investment has resumed, triggered by an increase in external demand on the back of a recovery in overseas economies.", "Turning to the household sector, the employment and income situation has remained weak, although significant deterioration has been avoided, partly owing to policy support (Chart 4).", "The number of employed persons declined due to the impact of mainly for employees in the services sector, and has remained at a relatively non-regular face-to-face low level to date.", "The unemployment rate has been at around 3 percent recently, which is somewhat higher than the level.", "The unemployment rate that takes into account \"employed persons not at work\" has been 6 percent, and labor underutilization indicator 4 (LU4), which is the unemployment rate that also includes potential labor force, has been 7.3 percent.", "Turning to wages, statistical features warrant attention.", "Wages in the Monthly Labour Survey are shown as an average and thus are susceptible to changes in composition of employment status.", "Some point out that real wages have not risen since the introduction of QQE.", "To accurately grasp the actual situation regarding wages, however, it is necessary to consider the compositional effects.", "For example, when the economy recovers, workers who have been unemployed will return to the labor market, and thus the average wages will be pushed down.", "Apparently, the rate of change in total cash earnings per employee had been sluggish even when the economy was recovering.", "However, the rate of change has been positive of late.", "This is attributable to a rebound from the decline seen last year, a fall in the share of employees, whose wage levels are low, and rising wages in the medical, healthcare, and welfare services industry, which faces a severe labor shortage.", "In addition, the rate of increase in scheduled cash earnings of employees, which are less susceptible to changes in composition of employment status, has expanded recently.", "As a result, employee income, obtained by multiplying the number of employees by total cash earnings, has turned to a lately (Chart 5).", "Nevertheless, private consumption has been stagnant due to strong downward pressure stemming from the impact of In particular, consumption of services, COVID-19.", "which includes eating and drinking as well as accommodations, has continued to be well below the level due to the resurgence of and the resultant pre-pandemic COVID-19 enactment of public health measures that has been having prolonged effects.", "In sum, For the differences between these unemployment rates, see the \"detailed tabulation\" in the Labour Force Survey by the Statistics Bureau of Japan.", "To be more precise, changes in the employment status and working hours need to be taken into consideration when calculating real wages.", "The Basic Survey on Wage Structure distinguishes regular employees from part-time workers, such as non-regular employees.", "Based on this, real hourly wages -- a term closer to real wages per employee -- are calculated.", "The estimation shows that real wages for regular employees hired for an indefinite period rose by 4.5 percent from 2012 to 2019, and those for non-regular employees (among part-time workers) increased by 8 percent during the same period.", "For details, see Iwata, K., \"Nihon-gata kakusa shakai\" kara no dakkyaku (Tokyo: Kobunsha Shinsho, 2021), pp.", "That said, the Basic Survey on Wage Structure is released only once a year and thus is too infrequent to properly track developments in wages in real time.", "uncertainties surrounding are still strongly constraining consumption activity, and a virtuous cycle from income to spending therefore is not yet seen in the household sector.", "C. Key in Forecasting the Outlook What is most important in terms of the outlook is that the degree of uncertainty over constraining economic activity decreases on the back of, for example, further progress with vaccinations, so that private consumption will no longer be sluggish.", "We cannot be optimistic about developments in domestic and overseas economies because the number of variant cases has kept increasing globally; however, as the impact of almost subsides, the virtuous cycle is expected to be seen not only in the corporate sector but also in the household sector.", "Furthermore, key to recovery in the overall economy gaining more strength is developments in \"standby\" funds, which are saved for future use, in each of the household and corporate sectors.", "\"Standby\" Funds in the Two Sectors Let me explain standby funds in the household sector (Chart 6).", "Since the pandemic, funds on hand have accumulated significantly in the household sector.", "This is because savings have increased due to the loss of consumption opportunities which mainly reflects restrictions on going out and to uncertainties over the future, and because subsidies have been provided under the economic measures.", "As constraints stemming from wane and uncertainties decline, demand is likely to materialize, mainly COVID-19 pent-up in services, which has been restrained thus far, and then private consumption is expected to recover.", "Given that and travel have been restricted under the pandemic for a long time, the size of their demand is expected to become significant.", "Standby funds that have accumulated in the household sector are also projected to support the materialization of this demand.", "Standby funds also have been accumulating recently in the corporate sector, although not to as remarkable a level as seen in the household sector.", "From the deflationary period, since Japanese firms tended to constrain business fixed investment relative to their amount of profits, savings clearly kept exceeding investment for a long period.", "This tendency of having excess savings in the corporate sector was not evident after the introduction of QQE.", "However, it has intensified again since the pandemic, partly due to growing uncertainties, including those over financial positions, and thus funds on hand have been accumulating.", "Attention is paid to whether the withdrawal of standby funds will encourage an increase in business fixed investment as the impact of wanes and uncertainties decline.", "Two \"Expectations\" In order for standby funds to be actually used, thereby leading to an increase in propensity to spend, it is important for firms and households to have a positive outlook for economic activity and prices (Chart 7).", "In this regard, the results of the Annual Survey of Corporate Behavior show that listed firms' growth expectations do not seem to have decreased remarkably even after experiencing a significant negative shock to economic activity brought about by Such steady expectations at present are clearly different COVID-19.6 from those at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), when they decreased considerably.", "This seems mainly because, in the face of the current worldwide pandemic crisis, governments and central banks around the world, including Japan, have made extremely prompt fiscal and monetary policy responses on an unprecedented scale (Chart 8).", "In fact, these timely policy responses have ensured the flow of funds to firms and households and have supported firms powerfully to sustain their businesses and employment.", "In addition to growth expectations, developments in inflation expectations are extremely important (Chart 7).", "If households or firms expect that prices will decline in the future, their incentives to postpone consumption or investment will increase and a virtuous cycle from income to spending will not operate.", "Various indicators for inflation expectations temporarily weakened somewhat after the outbreak of COVID-19, partly due to a significant decline in crude oil prices, but they recently have moved out of that phase, being more or less unchanged.", "Some indicators even show a partly reflecting the effects of the recent rise in international commodity prices.", "That said, further recovery in growth and inflation expectations of firms and households is necessary to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent.", "The Bank will closely examine whether this recovery can intensify the virtuous cycle in the overall economy.", "D. Price Developments Let me touch on price developments before moving on to the next topic (Chart 9).", "The rebasing of the consumer price index (CPI), which is conducted every five years, took place last month, and the rates of change since this spring were revised downward by about 0.7 percentage points.", "This is mainly because a reduction in mobile phone charges made a further negative contribution with the rebasing.", "Temporary factors such as a change in price plans for mobile phone charges and large fluctuations in energy prices should be excluded to capture actual developments in prices.", "When excluding these factors, the rebased CPI has been marginally positive.", "This is another example of difficulties in interpreting economic indicators, which I mentioned at the outset, and thus it is necessary to carefully examine relevant data, including the underlying factors behind developments in price indicators.", "Given the rebasing, the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) were revised downward from minus 0.4 percent to minus 0.5 percent for January through March 2021 and from 0.1 percent to minus 0.6 percent for April through June.", "The negative contribution of mobile phone charges to the rates of change in the CPI for April through June expanded from about minus 0.5 percentage points to about minus 1.1 percentage points.", "This reflects a rise in weight of mobile phone charges in the CPI, a resetting of the index level of such charges, and revision to the model formula used for calculating them.", "Challenges for Central Banks Today A.", "Actions on Climate Change The situation surrounding central banks continues to change.", "In July, the Bank released its strategy on climate change (Chart 10).", "I would like to explain the thinking behind this strategy.", "In recent years, there has been growing interest in the issue of climate change.", "Various central banks, together with financial regulatory and supervisory authorities, formed an organization called the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in December 2017, which the Bank of Japan joined in November 2019.10 In addition, central banks such as the Bank of England (BOE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) have begun to take policy actions to address climate change.", "Essentially, climate change can be regarded as a global market failure.", "Greenhouse gases are emitted as a result of economic activity.", "If they cause climate change, economic activity results in so-called negative externalities, which may bring about excessive greenhouse gas emissions.", "When market failures, including negative externalities, occur, public institutions such as governments may be in a position to make responses.", "Details of the Bank's efforts to address climate change can be found at /.", "According to the Peoples' Climate Vote, a survey of 1.22 million people in 50 countries conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Oxford University, 64 percent of respondents considered climate change to be a global emergency.", "The percentage was higher in small island developing states (74 percent) and high-income countries (72 percent), while it was lower in middle-income countries (62 percent) and least developed countries (58 percent).", "The percentage in Japan was 79 percent, the highest after the 81 percent both in the United Kingdom and Italy.", "For details, see -climate-vote.", "For details on the NGFS, see .", "Details of the responses to climate change by the BOE can be found on its web site at -change and the responses by the ECB on its web site at To be more precise, the correction of market failures does not necessarily require the involvement of government.", "When the Coase theorem in economics holds, it is theoretically possible to ensure through voluntary negotiations among parties that negative externalities are internalized.", "However, a prerequisite is that the cost of negotiation is low, and therefore this would not work as a response to climate change, which involves a myriad of entities.", "However, whether and how central banks should address climate change is controversial, even among economists.", "Issues of debate include the following.", "First, there are extremely high uncertainties over the mechanism of climate change and its impact.", "There are two types of risks associated with climate change: physical risks and transition risks.", "Physical risks refer to an increase in natural disasters such as floods caused by climate change.", "Transition risks emerge as a result of complying with environmental regulations and changing industrial structures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "As for the former risks, the recent flood damage around the world caused by heavy rains comes to mind.", "The torrential rains in Hiroshima Prefecture in July 2018 and this August also are fresh in our memories, and many have been suffering from them.", "Various scientists are carrying out research on climate change from the physical science basis and discussions are still underway.", "While the number of natural disasters appears to be increasing worldwide, the number of deaths related to natural disasters has been decreasing (Chart 11).", "On the other hand, there is the \"risk of doing For example, some point to the risk of central banks doing nothing about climate change and urge them to be involved in terms of financial regulation.", "Eichengreen, B.,

to aim for a balance with achieving economic growth.", "Economic growth has brought considerable benefits to human beings, such as longer average life expectancy, and the economy must have sufficient leeway to transition to a carbon-neutral one where natural disasters are less likely to occur.", "In order to achieve a carbon-neutral economy, new technologies that currently do not exist or are not used in light of cost effectiveness are also needed.", "The development and application of new technologies require new investments in research and development, machinery and equipment, and software, and economic growth is essential to such investments.", "De-growth or zero-growth would make it extremely difficult to solve climate change because either would preserve old technologies and machines that emit greenhouse gases.", "Therefore, it could be said that the \"sound development of the national economy\" is also necessary for addressing climate change.", "The challenge we face is to strike
