\u2022 monetary policy can foster long-term growth by supporting structural reforms and in particular the ones favoring a more resilient and efficient financial system.", "Monetary policy can contribute to alleviate the medium term negative effects of a deep recession on potential growth 1.1.", "First, \"border line\" between appropriate counter-cyclical monetary policy and medium-term sustainable growth is an open one.", "A deep recession, such as the Great recession, can have long lasting effects on potential growth, which are different in nature from the usual consequences of a cyclical downturn.", "Because of its duration and amplitude, it may damage the available human and physical capital stock as well as medium-term productivity growth.", "Monetary policy may alleviate these effects through an appropriate accommodative stance.", "First, a deep recession may lead to a depreciation of the available human capital stock1.", "Long term unemployment reached historical heights during the Great Recession in the United States, Spain, Italy or France, as you can see on this graph.", "The skills of long-term unemployed' may then be eroded by lack of practice.", "Long-term unemployment may also discourage part of the labour force, which may leave definitively the labour market.", "The structural decline in the labour force participation rate accelerated with the crisis in the United States.", "This evolution is however not shared by all countries, such as Spain.", "Indeed, the reverse behaviour may be observed as the unemployment of one member of a household may lead other members of the household to enter the labour market.", "The two effects can offset or dominate one another, leading to different country paths, as shown on the graph.", "Finally, a deep recession may lead to sectoral reallocation, with part of the labour force lacking appropriate skills.", "As can be seen in this graph, the Spanish construction workers had to face a sharp contraction of the share of employment in that sector, from 13% of total employment to 5% and find a job in other sectors.", "The decline is less significant but still relevant in countries which experienced a construction boom.", "More generally, according to a Banque de France research paper2, the Beveridge curve has shifted in the euro area and the United States, with more vacancies associated with a similar level of unemployment, pointing at an increase in structural unemployment.", "These effects of the crisis on human capital would fade away only slowly, with the arrival of new cohorts on the labour market.", "However, they could be mitigated by active labour market policies, such as an appropriate training policy, which have a very effective and targeted impact on human capital depreciation.", "Second, in Europe, the ECB has significantly loosened monetary policy in recent years even after the limits of conventional monetary policy have been reached.", "But this has been no ordinary recession.", "It has also been associated with an acute financial crisis and history has shown that recessions associated with financial crises can have an even longer lasting impact on economic performance.", "During financial crises, credit constraints can tighten drastically for banks and for firms and households which in turn harms physical capital and labour productivity growth.", "Financing constraints may lead to increased firm defaults.", "This may not be detrimental to long-term growth if it has a \"cleansing effect\", if non performing firms and equipment disappear and free resources for innovative young firms3.", "However, it may also hit young, innovative and risky firms, which are more fragile and financially dependent4.", "According to Foster, Grim and Haltiwanger5, reallocation in the United States during the Great recession R.

uttermost importance were the structural changes targeting an improvement in the monitoring and the resilience of our financial system.", "Arguably the financial crisis partly resulted from excess risk taking and overinvestment in low productivity sectors.", "The Basel 3 framework worldwide and the Single Supervisory Mechanism in the euro-zone provide new supervisory and prudential tools to mitigate these risks in the future.", "That said, many countries within the zone also have had to make sharp fiscal adjustments and implement significant structural reforms.", "Unfortunately, many of these structural reforms may have a transitory deflationary impact.", "This is the case of product market reforms, which directly target lower prices, but also of reforms fostering supply if demand is depressed.", "Enhanced competition in telecom led to an impressive decrease in prices: in France, the entrance of a fourth mobile phone operator led to a decrease in mobile costs by a quarter and a negative impact on the average CPI of 0.3 point in 2012.", "There have been similar disinflationary effects in many of the so-called stressed jurisdictions of the euro-zone.", "However, at the current juncture, structural reforms are badly needed due to the productivity slowdown and larger product and labour market reforms should be envisaged in highly regulated countries.", "In that case, it is crucial for the central bank to anchor inflation expectations, through a clear commitment to its inflation objective.", "The Governing Council has been clear that it is willing to do everything within its mandate to deliver on this objective which is headline inflation close to, but below, 2% over the medium term.", "Structural reforms can also have a short-term negative impact on employment and growth, especially in a depressed environment14.", "In that respect, monetary policy can provide an offsetting support to growth, along with fiscal policy.", "The various packages of monetary accommodation implemented by the Governing Council since mid-2014 have already had considerable success in supporting nominal growth.", "Even though headline inflation is currently negative, it would have been significantly weaker (around 80 basis points in 2016 according to the Euro-system's estimates) without these interventions.", "Real economic growth is slightly stronger and unemployment lower.", "However, it is important to stress that monetary policy is a companion to structural reforms rather than a substitute.", "Stimulatory monetary policy cannot be an excuse to postpone

acceptable position for any of you.", "Our monetary policy accommodation has made the cost of investment considerably cheaper but its effectiveness is blunted somewhat if entrepreneurs feel constrained by structural impediments and a lack of economic reform.", "The OECD has been urging a faster pace of structural reforms for many years now and I wish more governments would listen.", "But monetary policy and domestic structural reforms should not be the only game in town.", "We need a better overall policy mix.", "Against a background of accommodative monetary policy and faster economic reform, we need looser and better targeted fiscal policy at a European level.", "For example, more could be done to increase investment in public infrastructure, education and apprenticeship in Southern Europe.", "Fiscal expenditure could be shifted towards retraining programmes or other measures to help shift resources between sectors.", "One way of thinking about our current predicament is that the natural short-term real rate of interest is too low, due to insufficient ex ante investment relative to savings.", "The ECB has been providing substantial monetary accommodation using unconventional tools to try to push down the effective nominal rate.", "A better way in the long-term would be to raise the natural real rate of interest through stronger economic growth and investment.", "As for many other economic policies and concepts, the Great Recession led us to reconsider the role of central banks with regard to medium and long-term growth.", "Beyond their normaltime contribution to long-term growth as price stability guardians, central banks in deep depression have to act against the hysteresis effects of the crisis and the damages from financial sector disruptions.", "All indicators, from the matching process on the labour market to the reallocation of resources among firms, have shown how serious the shocks from the great recession have been, vindicating a large-scale and determined reaction of economic policy across the world.", "In this global economic policy reaction, it would be hard to argue that central banks have not done their share of the job.", "At the current juncture, however, all need to do their share.", "Focusing on the euro area, I am convinced that we would do much better with more growth-enhancing fiscal policies, especially in the member states that have fiscal space, and, at the same time, more ambitious structural reforms, especially in the member states that don't have fiscal space.", "Indeed, this is probably the most subtle criticism of the active monetary policy currently undertaken by central banks: has it been an excuse for inaction by other public authorities, in particular structural reforms?", "Our answer cannot be to stop doing our own job but, drawing on the legitimacy given by our own actions, to strongly invite governments to do more.", "In particular in my own country, here in Paris, reforms are necessary, as I stressed in my recent Letter to the French President some days ago.", "But reforms are also possible.", "Yes, France too, like many of its successful European
