The Relationship between Price Stability and Financial Stability Regarding the relationship between price stability and financial stability, it is increasingly recognized that the prolonged low interest rate environment raises two major issues.", "The first issue is that continued low interest rates can change the risk-taking behavior of financial institutions and affect financial stability.", "Along this line, two types of risks have been pointed out.", "The first is that low interest rates lead banks to take excessive risks, and the second is that any further cuts in policy interest rate beyond discourage risk-taking by banks.", "While empirical studies on this issue have been accumulating, they are not conclusive about the nature of risks including their probability distribution.", "The second issue is how to implement policy instruments for safeguarding financial stability.", "To address this issue, two different approaches are explored.", "One approach proposes a division of labor in the policy toolkit based on the Tinbergen rule: that is, monetary policy instruments are assigned to the pursuit of price stability, while macroprudential policy instruments are assigned to the achievement of financial stability.", "The other approach is to \"lean against the wind,\" that is, monetary policy instruments are implemented not just to achieve the price stability goal but also give due consideration to financial stability goals, under the premise that monetary policy influences broad areas of financial activities.", "It should be noted that, however, a wide range of people including those supporting the first approach recognize that no macroprudential policy toolkit is perfect, and that a key part of the second approach is to stave off a catastrophic financial disruption rather than to moderate financial cycles in an orderly manner.", "In that regard, the two approaches should not be regarded as completely different ones.", "D. Spillovers to Emerging and Developing Economies Regarding the spillovers, clearly, one of the issues on the policy agenda relating to prolonged low inflation and interest rates is challenges for emerging and developing economies.", "The reason is that such an environment in advanced economies could amplify capital flows into emerging and developing economies where inflation and interest rates tend to be higher.", "Although these capital inflows help boost domestic economic activity, they also carry the risk of economic disruptions such as a sudden outflow of capital or losses by borrowers due to exchange rate fluctuations.", "Recently, there has been a growing awareness among developing and advanced economies of the potential adverse impact of volatile capital flows.", "Conclusion We are now about to start the 25th BOJ-IMES Conference.", "Following my remarks, this lecture will be given by the former president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet.", "I am looking forward to hearing his views based on his long experience in macroeconomic policy management in the euro area.", "In the keynote speech, Professor Carl Walsh of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the new Honorary Adviser to IMES, will share his views on monetary policy frameworks under a low inflation and interest rate environment from an academic perspective.", "As the author of the textbook Monetary Theory and Policy, which is a must-read for central bank economists, and of various other significant contributions to the literature, he is one of the most influential academics in this field.", "Next, the paper presentations will focus on the following four topics: first, optimal monetary policy taking international capital inflows into account; second, the reversal interest rate; third, the Tinbergen Rule for financial stability and price stability; and fourth, the impact of prolonged low nominal interest rates on banking stability.", "The final and concluding session will be the policy panel discussion, moderated by Professor Athanasios Orphanides of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another Honorary Adviser to IMES.", "As panelists, we will have Mr. Christian Hawkesby, Mr. Klaus Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; Masuch, Principal Adviser to the Director General Economics of the European Central Bank; and Mr. Masazumi Wakatabe, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan.", "I hope that the theoretical and practical discussions in this conference will deepen our understanding of central bank design under a continued low inflation and interest rate environment.", "Thank you for your attention.", "Borio, Claudio E.
