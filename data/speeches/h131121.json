with high capital positions, low loan-to-deposit ratios, and essentially no toxic assets of the kind that set-off the 2007 global financial crisis.", "However, the sovereign crisis spilled over to the banking system, generating a general crisis of confidence, which intensified the contraction of GDP and worsened the debt dynamics.", "Yet, I believe that the future now looks brighter.", "Why do I believe this?", "Because, for one thing, during the past few years, throughout the contraction, Greece has made important progress in addressing its fiscal and external imbalances.", "In addition, the country's banking system has been recapitalized and consolidated.", "Allow me to consider each of these areas -

it was the result of enormous work, difficult decisions, and careful organization.", "However, this is not the end of the story for the transformation of the banking system.", "The second stage of our strategy is just beginning.", "This stage will be characterized by efforts to implement a new banking model.", "This model will allow banks to exploit synergies and economies of scale, and will, therefore, entail a further elimination of excess capacity.", "In this way, banks will become more efficient, gradually reducing their reliance on state aid and central-bank funding.", "Banks also need to refocus their business on their core activities.", "This step implies selling non-core assets and rationalizing their network and activities abroad.", "Rationalization does not mean outright sale.", "The banks will consider disposing operations that absorb disproportional amounts of capital and (scarce) liquidity.", "However they do not intend to proceed to fire sales of self-funded, efficient business units, a situation that characterizes most subsidiaries of Greek banks in Albania.", "But I will come back to this issue.", "As you may know, we have recently engaged BlackRock -
