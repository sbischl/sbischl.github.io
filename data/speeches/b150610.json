to give just one measure - have fallen by more than half from their pre-crisis peak of over US$8 trillion.", "I'll spend a few minutes on why we're seeing this fragmentation.", "I'll then offer my views on what we should do to realize the full benefits of financial globalization and manage the risks associated with it.", "Causes of fragmentation The retreat from financial globalization that we've seen reflects cyclical economic forces, such as the slowdown of global trade and investment.", "It also reflects structural adjustments, including the deleveraging undertaken by banks to repair their balance sheets and respond to regulatory changes.", "None of this should come as a surprise, given what we've been through.", "On the cyclical side, the crisis has cost the world economy as much as US$10 trillion in lost output, or almost 15 per cent of production.", "Global trade slowed, as did the demand for the international financial services that support it.", "The share of trade in GDP fell after the crisis, reversing some of the 20-percentage-point increase over the two decades that preceded it.", "On the structural side, financial institutions that experienced losses during the crisis had to repair their balance sheets by scaling back their lending -
