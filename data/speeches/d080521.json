growth at one level has been catalyzed by the growing global imbalances as oil rich economies accumulated capital from the persistent rise in international oil prices.", "It is the accumulated surpluses and wealth of the oil exporting members of the Middle East, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), that have helped the global financial players to develop IF markets.", "Over 2002-2006, GCC capital outflows, as reported by the International Institute of Finance (IIF), rose to $530 billion: of this $300 billion outflows went to US, $100 billion to Europe and remaining to

financial architecture that encourages standardization of legal structure and contracts, prudential regulation and supervision supported by appropriate risk management of the special features and structure of the new products, and accounting practices in line with AAOIFI standards; Encourage harmonization and convergence of religious views (emerging from differences in interpretations of
