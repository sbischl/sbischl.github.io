the policy deliberations of the Bank.", "I strongly believe that, especially in these unusual times, this kind of dialogue with the private sector is critical.", "I probably do not need to tell anyone in this room that we are indeed living in unusual times.", "Policymakers around the world have been grappling for the past six years with an economic crisis, which has repeatedly mutated, and it is still not clear what direction the crisis is going to take next.", "From its origins as a sub-prime crisis in the United States to its morphing into a sovereign debt crisis in Europe, to its current manifestation of fiscal/political gridlocks across both sides of the Atlantic, various measures taken to address each mutation of the crisis have led to unintended consequences.", "Just about three months ago, the IMF Managing Director was talking about a three-speed global economy in which emerging markets and developing countries were generally doing well, while some advanced economies like the United States were on the mend.", "Others such as Japan and those in the Euro area still had some distance to travel.", "During the last few weeks, sentiment has changed dramatically in global

Reserve clearly stated that should this commence, it would be done very slowly and would be highly conditional.", "The surprising intensity of market reaction to the potential end of quantitative easing contributed to a sudden reversal of capital flows in many emerging market economies, sending their currencies tumbling and their stock markets into decline.", "Such volatility may well signal the start of a new mutation of the ongoing global financial crisis.", "It may well be a forerunner to the new risks that could materialize when unconventional U.S. monetary policy begins to unwind in earnest.", "At the same time, it is important to note that many \"old\" tail risks (low probability, high-impact events) in the global economy - a breakup of the Euro zone, the United States going over the fiscal cliff, a hard landing in China - still remain unresolved.", "The domestic economy Ladies and Gentlemen, the Trinidad and Tobago economy has weathered the turbulence of the global financial crisis fairly well, but we are yet to experience a sustained recovery from the downturn that started in late 2008.", "Let me give a brief summary of our current economic position.",

larger-than-expected decline in natural gas production.", "The sharp shortfall in natural gas production adversely affected both refining activity and output of petrochemicals.", "Crude oil production continued its secular decline on account of aging oil fields and lower condensate output.", "On the other hand, the non-energy sector continued its slow but steady pace of revival, but could not fully

sector.", "On the other hand, like last year, continuing maintenance and security upgrades by energy companies are holding back the energy sector from delivering an improved performance this year.",

per cent in May 2013.", "The slowdown in inflation was largely associated with a steady fall in food price inflation, especially as softening global grain and cereal prices eased the inflationary impetus from abroad.", "The removal of Value Added Tax (VAT) on selected non-luxury food items in mid-November 2012 had a one-off impact on reducing food price inflation.", "Core inflation, which

June 2013, or more than 10 months of import cover.", "Economic outlook Ladies and Gentlemen, the recent up-turn in domestic economic activity, particularly in the non-energy sector, indicates that economic sentiment is gradually improving and becoming more widespread.", "Perhaps the most fundamental downside risk to the country's improving economic outlook relates to the actions of the two largest natural gas producers (BPTT and BGTT), who are expected to continue major maintenance operations with significant shutdowns scheduled around September 2013.", "This is a high probability, high impact event.", "Failure on the part of both the Ministry of Energy and Energy Affairs and these two energy companies to reach agreement on minimizing the very sharp supply disruptions in energy

Gentlemen, let me now turn to an issue that I would like to highlight in the context of this morning's discussion on competitiveness and sustainable development.", "Many expect central banks to be the ones that can bring back growth.", "And indeed, over the past few years, the global financial crisis has placed immense demands on monetary policy around the world.", "In his Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture held at the Bank of International Settlements a week ago, Professor Raghuram Rajan from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business described the situation quite well: \"When the central banker offers himself as the only game in town, in an environment where politicians only have choices between the bad and the worse, he becomes the only game in town.\"", "But we are not the only game in town.", "I wish to remind you all that, through its monetary policy, the Central Bank can influence aggregate demand in the economy.", "But monetary policy cannot solve deeper structural problems or lift the growth potential of the economy.", "That requires bringing more balance to fiscal policy and speeding up the implementation of structural policies that eliminate supply-side constraints to private investment in the nonenergy sector.", "From our frequent conversations with business leaders, we know that one of the most important structural issues facing the Trinidad and Tobago economy at the moment is the need to boost business confidence.", "Trinidad and Tobago is looking for a return to self-sustaining, self-generating growth.", "To realize such economic growth we

integrated iron and steel complex on Union Estate, La Brea.", "Neal and Massy's Project Development Agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals Company and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to construct and operate plants to produce Methanol and Dimethyl-Ether (DME) at Union Estate, La Brea.", "The project is expected to cost roughly US$850 million.", "I commend these business leaders for their vote of confidence in the country's economic prospects, but it is not enough.", "We need the entire business community to stop watching and commenting on the game from the sidelines.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, there is a view that business must stop feeding from government.", "And business must start feeding government.", "I remind you of the damning words that Ralph Maraj in his December 31, 2012 column in the Trinidad Express entitled \"The Private Sector Can't Dance\" had for the business community: \"For the past few years, most of our business elite have been sitting on their resources, marking time but still accumulating; only a few venturing to take some measured risk to stimulate the economy; most waiting, as always, for the treasury to provide new feeding.", "And they continue to absurdly shout to the government 'diversify, diversify', as if they had no responsibility in this critical national need.\"", "Peter O' Connor in his Sunday June 30 Newsday column entitled \"Lacking Leadership\" echoed similar concerns.", "\"Which businessman here, with the banking system drowning in liquidity, has the vision and capability to diversify our economy instead of begging government for 'corporate URP'\"?", "Since the Central Bank is not the only game in town, I take this opportunity to remind the entire business community of their responsibilities and urge them back onto the field.", "My appeal to you is to take a longer term perspective and invest in people and technology to raise our growth level and to make our growth more inclusive.", "Play the game passionately, intensely and fearlessly!", "In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that Trinidad and Tobago has been navigating well the choppy waters of the global financial crisis, and will continue to do so.", "But this is not the message that we seem to be absorbing as a nation.", "Instead, it is one of a country lurching from one crisis to another.", "We seem to have a penchant for self-inflicted wounds, looking at our country from the glass is half empty perspective.", "I appeal to all of us to look at our economy from a glass half full point of view.", "This is actually not difficult to do.", "Growth is consolidating, unemployment is low, public debt is very manageable and our citizens still enjoy a high standard of living.", "The Central Bank is absolutely
