User-friendliness The third key concept is that the global code should be succinct, clear, and easy to use.", "The code becomes valuable only when market participants make good use of and adhere to it in their day-to-day business at the practical level.", "In addition, bearing in mind the existence of diverse participants and diverse business models, I would like to emphasize the importance of clearly addressing what market participants can do under the code.", "This is to prevent over-cautious behavior of market participants which could be detrimental to fostering well-functioning markets.", "As an initiative to enhance market functioning through clearer dialogue among market participants, the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market Committee developed the \"Tokyo Blue Book\" in April last year.", "The book provides guidance with succinct, clear statements and practical examples to help promote understanding of the code among Tokyo market participants.", "Concluding remarks I firmly believe that the successful development of a single global code and greater adherence to it will reinforce the functioning of the foreign exchange market and facilitate vibrant, sound development of the market.", "The Bank of Japan has been, and will continue to fully support and be committed to the work of the global code.", "I am confident that this Tokyo meeting will provide us with a valuable opportunity to achieve further progress in our work.", "Thank you very much for your kind attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["global code", "foreign exchange market", "market liquidity", "principle-based code", "collaboration", "public sector", "private sector", "user-friendliness", "Tokyo Blue Book", "market functioning"]}
