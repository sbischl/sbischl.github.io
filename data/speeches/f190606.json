when my native Canada was an emerging economy, net capital inflows averaged 10% of GDP every year for around three decades.", "But the recent history of capital flows is more chequered.", "After all, the IIF was founded 36 years ago in response to the Latin American debt crisis.", "That crisis was the product of an initially well founded and productive but ultimately over exuberant and destructive recycling of petro dollars by the banking system.", "That period provided painful examples both of how capital flows can support development and how capital flow volatility can undermine it.", "The Asian crisis almost 15 years later underscored the risks of relying on inflows that look stable but prove ephemeral.", "And subsequent crises in Latin America around the turn of the millennium and in advanced economies (AEs) a decade ago reinforced the risks of taking capital flows for granted.", "In theory, foreign capital inflows should support growth through greater allocative efficiency, better risk sharing and increased technology transfer.", "But in reality financial openness has proven a double-edged sword.", "The typical emerging market economy (EME) receiving higher capital inflows will grow 0.3 percentage points faster, all else equal (Chart 1).", "But the typical EME with higher capital flow volatility will grow 0.7 percentage points slower (Chart 2).", "Notes:

cases.", "Overall, EMEs have increased their financial openness by considerably less than advanced economies (AEs) since 1980, leaving their external balance sheets only around a third the size of those in AEs, despite much faster growth in external trade (Chart 4).", "These responses, while understandable, carry significant opportunity costs.", "Excess precautionary savings in EMEs are pushing down equilibrium interest rates, increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap.", "And enormous cross border flows will be required to close EME infrastructure investment gaps and to finance the essential transition to a low carbon economy.", "Today, I want to examine what drives capital flow volatility and, in the process, sketch an agenda for sustainable capital flows in the new world order.", "Specifically, what should be the priorities to increase sustainable cross border capital flows?", "How many are the responsibility of the receiving country?", "What about the advanced economies who set the tone for the global financial cycle?", "And to what extent does the structure of the international monetary financial system itself, including the global safety net, determine safe flows?", "begin to answer these questions, the Bank of England is developing a holistic \"Capital To Flows-at-Risk\" framework that assesses the relative contribution of the three drivers of

their core have generally delivered inflation rates that are both lower and less variable.", "This directly benefits all citizens in good times.", "Moreover, greater monetary policy credibility gives

actions where warranted.", "As long as there remains a fundamental asymmetry between the multi-polar global economy and dollar- dominated international monetary financial system, absent other reforms EMEs may turn to Capital Flow Management (CFM) measures to safeguard financial stability in the face of push shocks.", "For example, limits on foreign currency borrowing and restrictions on the activities of open-ended investment funds could help EMEs to avoid dangerous build-up in volatile debt.", "But there are clear shortcomings to CFMs.", "History has shown them to be addictive and often highly IMF's Institutional View makes clear distortionary.", "That is why the that CFMs should not substitute for domestic institutional reforms nor warranted macroeconomic adjustments.", "There are two major challenges in operationalising CFMs.", "The first is proving intent so as not to provoke retaliation.", "The second is that they can panic investors and make matters worse.", "A Capital Flows-at-Risk framework might help with these judgements.", "If authorities can develop and agree a holistic approach it could inform policy actions, including the occasional disciplined use of Capital Flow Management tools in EMEs and the deployment of macroprudential measures in AEs.", "Indeed, policymakers in 'push' economies also have special responsibilities to manage risks in these

investment funds have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate their assets.", "Under stress they may need to fire

mismatches are domiciled in the US and Europe so, as is the case for banks, ensuring leverage and liquidity risks are managed in funds investing abroad is both a national asset and a global public

countries.", "The upcoming FSB-IOSCO evaluation of implementation and effectiveness of recommendations to address liquidity mismatch in funds will be crucial to improve our understanding of best practice, including the merits of adjustments to redemption periods to be more consistent with investments.", "We are mindful that these decisions could have global as well as local implications.", "And we would welcome the IIF's contributions to informing these judgements.", "Better surveillance, a more resilient core of the financial system and a macroprudential approach to market- based finance will all help increase sustainable capital flows, but they will be most effective if they are underpinned by an adequate GFSN.", "Pooling resources at the IMF is much more efficient than individual countries self-insuring against Capital Flows-at-Risk, distributing the costs across all 189 member countries.", "To maintain reserve adequacy in the face of future larger and more risky

suggests that advice was once worthy but is increasingly incomplete.", "The significant improvements in the institutional frameworks of EMEs are being offset by the deepening fundamental asymmetry in the international monetary financial system, the continued shrinking of the GFSN, and the rapid rise of market-based finance.", "Now there can be innocent bystanders: but there should be no disinterested observers.", "We are all responsible for addressing the fault lines in the global financial system and its safety net.", "The IIF with its diverse and global membership can make a major contribution.", "In doing so we will reduce the volatility of capital flows, increase the sustainability of cross-border investment, and meet the great challenges of our age.", "Since 1980 a maximum of 30% of EMs have concurrently been in an IMF programme, and since 1970 a maximum of 38% of EMs have experienced a crisis concurrently.", "This is based on projections of emerging market economies' external balance sheets - see footnote 21.", "To date three countries, Colombia, Mexico, and Poland, have used the IMFs Flexible Credit Line.", "While none of the three countries have so far drawn down on these lines, the FCL has provided a valuable backstop for these countries and helped boost market confidence during the period of heightened risks.", "Annex: Capital flows-at-risk The Bank's

flows into those intermediated via investment funds and those which are not.", "The analysis focuses on the effect of push and pull shocks on capital flows in the contemporaneous quarter and the subsequent two quarters.", "In a second specification the role of a set of additional factors (X) in affecting the sensitivity of capital flows- at-risk to global push shocks is considered.", "This is done by adding an interactive effect to equation (1):37 KF@R = \u03b1 + \u03b2 Push + \u03b3 Pull + \u03b4 X + \u03b8 (Push \u2217 X) + u (2) A series of factors is considered: in one specification the focus is on the share of foreign currency- denominated debt and a measure of reserve adequacy, while in another specification the role of macro- prudential policy is analysed.", "The FCI is the first principal component of the following series: long term government bond yields, term spreads, sovereign spreads, interbank spreads, corporate spreads, equity returns, equity volatility and financials market capitalisation (normalised by the broader market).", "These indices are based on those presented by the IMF in their April 2017 GFSR.", "The main difference between this specification and the one proposed by the IMF in their October 2018 GFSR is that they consider capital flows in aggregate across EMs and, consequently, can only look at the effect of push factors.", "The choice to do this in a panel setting with country-specific series means pull factors can be incorporated into the analysis.", "The current analysis also broadens the scope from portfolio flows to
