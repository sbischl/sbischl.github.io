supports jobs and growth.", "Our price stability objective is clear: the inflation target of 2% CPI inflation.", "Supporting jobs means helping the economy reach the maximum sustainable level of employment.", "That level changes as the economy changes.", "That is why, a little more than a year ago, even though inflation had been above the target for most of the past five years and economic growth was poised to accelerate, we did not raise interest rates from their historic low level of 1\u20442%.", "We did not because we recognised that the UK had a huge number of unemployed and under-employed workers and that the economy was running below full capacity.", "We expected inflation to fall back.", "We saw that confidence might have been returning, but it remained fragile.", "We knew the nascent recovery was not yet secure.", "So we used the flexibility in our remit, given to us by Parliament, to return inflation to the target over a longer period than usual in order to support sustainable jobs and growth.", "To make our intentions clear, the Bank committed not to even think about raising interest rates from historic lows at least until unemployment fell back to 7%.", "That guidance gave businesses the confidence to hire and invest.", "It reassured households that the costs of servicing their debts were not about to rise abruptly at a time when they remained particularly sensitive to interest rates.", "And it evolved with the economy.", "The effectiveness of that policy has been reinforced by the healing of the financial sector.", "Prompted by the Bank of England, British banks have raised over \u00a3140 billion in new capital in the past few years.", "They are right-sizing their balance sheets and re-focussing their businesses.", "The recovery has exceeded all expectations.", "There has been a sustained and sharp fall in the unemployment rate to 6.4%.", "Over 800,000 jobs have been created in the past year alone.", "The challenge now is to secure a durable expansion; to make sure the economy realises its full potential.", "What does that mean for interest rates?", "With many of the conditions for the economy to normalise now met, the point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer.", "In recent months the judgement about precisely when to raise Bank Rate has become more balanced.", "We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data.", "Moreover, the precise timing of the first rate rise is less important than our expectation that, when rates do begin to rise, those increases are likely to be gradual and limited.", "Rates will go up only as far and as fast as is consistent with price stability as part of a durable expansion, with the maximum sustainable level of employment.", "For a variety of reasons ranging from the weakness in the euro area, to ongoing repair of household balance sheets, we are not expecting interest rates to head back to the levels seen before the Great Recession.", "The actual path of interest rates will be determined by the evolution of the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.", "Before the crisis, monetary policy largely tracked developments in aggregate demand because the structural dynamics of labour supply and productivity growth were relatively consistent.", "But in the wake of the crisis, the supply side of the economy has been anything but predictable.", "Originally, we thought the major uncertainties were centred on productivity growth.", "But as the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has seen wages, employment and productivity evolve, we are increasingly of the view that there has been a material labour supply shock for the reasons that I have discussed.", "So we have been paying increasingly close attention to developments in the labour market.", "Our forecasts for the next three years, and hence our interest rate decisions, are based on key judgements that: \u2022 the number of people participating in the labour force will continue to rise, reaching 64% of the population later in the year and continuing its upward trend of the past \u2022 the unemployment rate that the economy can sustain without generating accelerating inflation will return to where it was before the Great Recession (around 5%), and, at around 51\u20442% now, is currently only a little above that; and \u2022 there is scope for the average hours people work to increase further, reducing by about half the current gap between actual and reported desired hours.", "In short, and unlike the US and euro area, the economy is likely to be able to sustain a higher level of employment than in the past.", "The uncertainty is less the direction of that development and more its magnitude.", "To assess that magnitude and its implications for inflation, we are tracking a range of indicators, including those of the prospective paths for wages and unit labour costs.", "Actual wage growth, at just 0.6% since a year ago excluding bonuses, is currently very weak.", "However, there are some leading indicators that point to a modest pick up over coming quarters.", "For example, job-to-job flows have been increasing (Chart 11) and some surveys of pay growth have picked up more sharply in the last year.", "Although the relationship between these surveys and average wage growth has become less robust in recent years (Chart 12), they do offer encouraging evidence of better wage prospects for those changing or finding new jobs.", "Of course, the pay of existing employees needs to pick up as well.", "After all, what matters for economy-wide inflation is the average wage relative to economy-wide productivity.", "To that end, we will be closely monitoring pay settlements that are bunched around the turn of the year and taking a steer from the pay of new hires as a potential leading indicator of broader pay pressures.", "Some observers have discounted the implications for inflation of the recent weakness of pay growth because it stems from the types of jobs being filled - a \"compositional effect\".", "However, these are real jobs being performed by real people, and an increase in lowerskilled lower-wage jobs is one consequence of working-off the labour supply shock.", "We also need to be mindful of the possibility that it represents part of a longer-term trend towards job polarisation.", "What matters for inflationary pressures, irrespective of the type of job, is the relationship between wages and productivity, as captured by unit labour costs.", "Across the economy, wage growth is barely above productivity growth.", "Unit labour costs are currently soft (growing at only around 1% in the economy as a whole), are below the growth rate necessary to meet the inflation target, and indicate that there is further to go before we reach the new sustainable level of employment.", "In other words, there is still slack in the labour market that must be used up, and the recent revisions to the profile of UK output up to 2012 seem unlikely to change that assessment materially.", "That slack is wasteful.", "And if it were to remain, inflation would remain below the 2% target.", "The MPC's current best collective judgement is that, while it has narrowed rapidly, this slack is broadly in the region of 1% of GDP.", "As this margin of slack continues to narrow, we expect wages to pick up slightly faster than productivity, and unit labour cost growth should increase, consistent with meeting the inflation target.", "However, the MPC expects it will take the better part of three years for this to happen.", "With inflation at 1.6%, continuing downward pressure from the appreciation of sterling, and with slack remaining, the current inflation environment is benign.", "But it will not remain benign if we do not increase interest rates prudently as the expansion progresses.", "Our latest forecasts show that, if interest rates were to follow the path expected by markets - that is, beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually - inflation would settle at around 2% by the end of the forecast and a further 1.2 million jobs would have been created.", "In other words, we would achieve our mandate.", "There is, as always, uncertainty about the future.", "But uncertainty does not mean stasis.", "You can expect interest rates to begin to increase.", "The exact path will depend on the economy.", "Our assessment will undoubtedly change as the economy evolves and policy will of course be adjusted if geopolitical events have a material impact on the outlook.", "If indicators suggest the economy is moving more slowly towards our goals, we will have learned that we are further from sustainable capacity.", "Prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be weaker.", "Rates will go up later and more gradually.", "And should we see faster progress, prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be stronger, which will suggest we are closer to maximum capacity and that the economy can sustain higher rates sooner.", "In all events, rate rises can be expected to be gradual and limited compared to the experience of the UK in the past.", "Conclusion We are under no illusions.", "The Great Recession was a calamity.", "Britain's workers have borne many of the consequences.", "Our job is to ensure the economy achieves its potential and to maintain price and financial stability, for sustainable growth in jobs and incomes.", "But monetary policy cannot do it alone.", "Others - including trade unions, government and businesses - will determine the potential of this economy.", "You will ultimately determine the size of Britain's pay rise.", "Those in work need to be able to seize new job opportunities in a world where technology and globalisation cause labour markets to shift rapidly.", "Skill levels need to be raised continually.", "That is of course first and foremost about education.", "But crucially it also means access to lifelong learning, both on and off the job, available to all.", "The TUC's engagement with the UK's skills agenda is a major contribution to realising that imperative.", "In the past year alone, unionlearn, has supported over 200,000 people to invest in their skills.", "Such investments are crucial for the durability of this economic expansion and for Britain's future.", "They will help to deliver long-term productivity - so that the British people get the pay rise they deserve.", "Chart 1: UK unemployment rose by less Chart 2:
