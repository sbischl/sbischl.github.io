various municipalities.", "While larger banks may have their own reasons for expanding their branching footprint, the net effect is that rural banks now face more competition.", "Furthermore, the

industry ready to face up to the challenges of a changing market landscape?", "Well, an objective assessment leads us to conclude that much has been done to prepare the industry.", "Our banking reform agenda in the past 20 years has been structured to strengthen our local banks and to be more responsive to the needs of stakeholders.", "In particular, our efforts to bolster risk management systems,

archipelago where demographic differences across localities are significant.", "This may seem like a stumbling block but this also represents opportunities for rural banks.", "For instance, our experience in microfinance and financial inclusion shows that alternative delivery channels are viable.", "You can therefore find a balance between alternative delivery mechanisms vis-a\u0300-vis the brick and mortar approach of traditional branching.", "As you move from one locality to another, you will discover that one approach is more viable than the other, depending on the economics of the locality itself.", "For other areas, it may be economically feasible to offer both approaches to the community.", "In the current environment, we do see a silver lining: in the face of rising
