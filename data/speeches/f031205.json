Cyprus.", "I will focus on developments in the transition countries, and especially in the Czech Republic, which I know best.", "I will also try to make reference to other accession countries to show that the results of developments over the last thirteen years, at least in the financial sector, are not so different.", "This brief presentation cannot do more than deliver only a basic description of the past development of financial markets in the transition countries and of their current standing.", "Hopefully the data from this presentation can serve as background information for those interested in further studies.", "The financial sectors of the new Accession Countries have undergone huge and substantial reforms over last 13 years.", "When communism collapsed, there were no traces of a market economy, no free and legal entrepreneurial economic activity, and no institutions necessary for the functioning of a market economy.", "If we look at the transition economies - which

the financial sector was bleak.", "There were no services aside from basic banking and insurance functions.", "The banking sector was comprised of few specialized institutions, each of them a monopoly in its own area [one institution had monopoly on collecting deposits from the public, another institution provided all the foreign trade financing, and yet another institution was allowed to open accounts for individuals with foreign exchange incomes].", "Then there was a monobank, the most important financial institution, which performed both functions, of a commercial bank and of the central bank [however skewed that could have been in the centrally planned economy].", "We should also understand that commercial banking was not about evaluating loan applications and looking at projects' fundamentals or clients' credentials.", "In the former socialist countries, there was a State Planning Commission that decided how much of certain production would get produced and by whom.", "The role of the banks was limited only to finding funds for financing the planned production.", "It is important to acknowledge the situation at the outset of economic and political reforms.", "This would also help us to understand some of the problems that the transition economies went through later on.", "Thirteen years ago there were basically no real banks, no capital markets, no experienced staff and no experienced management.", "In addition to that, there was no capital in the banks.", "The ratio of capital to banks' assets was on average well below 1%.", "At the same time, there was a boom in entrepreneurial activities, with tens of thousands of new companies sprouting up.", "Their common characteristic was that they had no history, no experience, no capital, but great need for debt financing.", "On top of this, all the laws were changing, institutions [such as prudential banking supervision] were built only gradually, and the state as decisive owner in the banking sector was not up to its duties as good manager.", "As said above, the banking sector represented the crucial part of the financial sector of the country.", "Therefore, it was also the one to be hit the most seriously in the course of the economic reform, especially on the credit allocation side.", "On the contrary, deposits continued to grow despite the negative real interest rate.", "The economic

owned some of the most important corporations, as well as the main banks.", "In most of the countries, the privatization of most firms happened early in the transformation process.", "Banks were an exception to this, and in different countries, the approach to privatization of banks varied.", "In the Czech Republic, the privatization of banks had been delayed for several years due to the government's belief that privatized banks would stop providing soft loans to strategically important firms.", "This fear was underlined by the experience with foreign banks that were entering the market since 1992 and cherrypicking their clients.", "After several years, the bad debt burden on banks' balance sheets reached such a scale that government had to step in.", "Most of the debt ended

sector, which represents approximately 80% of total assets of the whole financial sector.", "It could be also seen that despite the dominance of banks in all mentioned countries, the structure of other financial institutions differs significantly.", "This is the result of varying approaches to building these institutions.", "For instance, in the Czech Republic, we can see the smaller size of the investment business as a result of the quality of the capital markets, the lax regulation at the beginning of the transformation, and the subsequent and rather frequent occurrence of frauds in the past.", "The delayed start of pension reform has also contributed to this situation.", "The largest banking sector in the new member states is the Polish one, followed by the Czech and the Hungarian sectors.", "These three biggest countries account for more than 3/4 of the total new member states banking assets.", "The banking sector of all new member states is nevertheless very small in comparison with the EU market.", "The total banking sector assets in all new member states are only 345 USD billions at the end 2002 (thus just 31,5% of Citigroup, or 43,4% of Deutsche bank, or 45,5%

intermediation [illustrated by Czech Republic].", "In the Czech Republic, the share of non-banking financial intermediation on GDP increased over last two years from 19% to 21,7%.", "The highest increase was in the share of insurance companies and financial leasing institutions.", "However, the majority of these non-banking financial intermediators is controlled by financial groups headed by commercial banks.", "A relatively low share of investment companies and investment funds were negatively influenced by missing regulation and supervision in this field, however, there has been gradual improvement in recent years.", "In the area of pension funds we also witness gradual improvement caused mostly by government incentives, but we can expect quicker development if the government proceeds with intended pension reform.", "The approach to bank privatization differed in the new member states, but the results are now rather comparable.", "The banking sector is dominated by

grim situation in the banking sector, where many of the newly established banks collapsed under the burden of bad debts.", "The state-owned banks had to have their capital replenished by the

member states are ready for application of Single Passport policy [it basically means that any bank from any EU country could provide services in the whole EU without additional licensing requirements.].", "Since the domestic banking markets in the new member countries are competitive enough and have already a strong presence of foreign institutions, this should not lead to dramatic changes in lending in these countries.", "Being a part of larger economic area, with banking sectors dominated by foreign institutions, will represent a new challenge for bank supervisors.", "The need for greater and more efficient cross-border cooperation will probably lead to changes in focus of the supervisory agencies.", "After their accession to the EU, I do not expect any contagion effect

risk management techniques will be done on group wide level and thus outside of the host country jurisdictions.", "There will be some risks and potential threats arising from the changes.", "But at this time, there is not a single specific risk that would threaten to disrupt the banking and financial services in the new member states after becoming part of the single market.", "Capital markets in the new member states were previously non-existent.", "In the Czech Republic, a capital market was developed as a \"byproduct\" of the voucher privatization.", "Introduction of regulation and supervision was delayed and the Securities and Exchange Commission was created only a few years after the market had existed.", "The capital market is stagnating as a result of voucher privatization, during which the number of shares congested the market.", "This subsequently lead to large de-listing of the number of shares from the market (the number of shares traded now is 23 times smaller than in 1995, just after the voucher privatization).", "The market was also plagued by frauds and non-transparent behavior.", "The volumes and market capitalization has stagnated, 88,5% of total volume is concentrated into 5 shares.", "There has never been any IPO, and even the good companies are de-listed from the market after their privatization (such as Ceska Sporitelna, the largest Czech retail bank).", "Capital markets in some of the other new member states function arguably better than the Czech one, nevertheless their significance is also much less than in more developed countries.", "The aggregate equity market capitalization in all new member states represents less than 2% of market capitalization in the EU.", "The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest one in the region [40% of total].", "The volume traded is approximately eight times the size of share trading and there is much higher liquidity.", "Continuous increase in volume is mainly due to the issuance of new public debt.", "It is evident that with limited share trading, there is not a very rosy future ahead.", "There are discussions about merging the markets in the region and possibly joining some European Stock Exchange.", "There are some speculations about the Stock Exchange in Vienna wanting to be the market for the region [Vienna is the second smallest SE in the EU.].", "However, individual countries would prefer to either remain independent, or to cooperate more closely with some bigger partners - such as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.", "As shown above, the financial sector is generally in good shape.", "There are some differences among the individual parts of the financial sector, but the main part [the banking sector] is as sound and strong as never before.", "This is due to several reasons, such as the improving legal environment, improving management, or even outright government financial assistance in the past.", "However, the greatest difference is due to the privatization to foreign banking institutions.", "These institutions have brought all the necessary components for successful long-term banking.", "The legislative and regulatory framework has been harmonized with the acqui communautaire.", "The harmonization has been confirmed by EC Peer reviews and by the multinational financial institutions (such as the IMF and World Bank during their FSAP process).", "Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done.", "The legislation and regulation shall be more streamlined, the area of law enforcement needs to function more efficiently, changes in accounting standards must be made.", "But these tasks are not related purely to the EU accession.", "They would have to be done under any circumstances.", "The financial sectors in the new member states are functioning efficiently, and are stable and competitive.", "The majority of financial sectors are in foreign hands, well capitalized and well managed.", "Institutions from the EU are governing the largest financial institutions in the new member states.", "Introduction of the Single Passport policy will mean a change only de iure, not de facto.", "Foreign institutions that wanted to provide their services in the new member states are already present there.", "I do not expect any rush of new players to the new countries of the European Union.", "It is more probable that with increasing living standards of the population, the space for new financial products' penetration will increase as well.", "I expect to see increased competition in this area, as already established institutions compete for new clients.", "It is unlikely that many new financial institutions will enter the market, because the market is already saturated, and players who had a strategic interest in Central Europe have already established themselves.", "Authorities from the new countries are already participating in committees and working groups established by the European Commission and European Central Bank, so that rules, as well as the policy thinking are being coordinated and harmonized.", "Challenges from the EU accession will therefore not represent any major risk.", "The problems and challenges that the new member states will face are not any different from those that are faced by the \"old\" member states, such as implementing the new Basle Capital Accord, implementing the IAS, increasing cross-border cooperation, monitoring activities of large complex financial groups, evaluating new complicated financial products, understanding risk transfer among different financial institutions.", "The transition will greatly benefit from the hard work that has been done during the economic transition and during the preparatory stages for the EU accession.", "It will be smooth
