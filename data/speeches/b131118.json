past.", "While victory is not assured, we have made sufficient progress that we can look ahead to what we need to do in the next few years to put ourselves firmly back on the path of strong and

we have left behind, let us focus on improving the conditions for growth for all.", "Our measure of success should be the jobs that are created, not by giving government subsidies or protections to

concentrated in food and services.", "Our households are turning to gold because they find financial investments unattractive.", "At the same time, many industrial corporations are complaining about high interest rates because they cannot pass through their higher costs into higher prices for their products.", "We can spend a long time debating the sources of this inflation.", "But ultimately, inflation comes from demand exceeding supply, and it can be curtailed only by bringing both in balance.", "We need to reduce demand somewhat without having serious adverse effects on investment and supply.", "This is a balancing act, which requires the Reserve Bank to act firmly so that the economy is disinflating, even while allowing the weak economy more time than one would normally allow for

aid of banking.", "Liquid markets will help banks offload risks they should not bear, such as interest rate or exchange risk.", "They will also allow banks to sell assets that they have no comparative advantage in holding, such as long term loans to completed infrastructure projects, which are better held by infrastructure funds, pension funds, and insurance companies.", "Liquid markets will help promoters raise equity which is sorely needed in the Indian economy to absorb the risks that banks otherwise end up absorbing.", "Rather than seeing markets as being inimical to the development of the banking sector, we have to see them as complementary - of course, this requires you bankers to build on your risk management capabilities so that you can use markets effectively.", "In the coming

fine banks, NBFCs, IT companies and mobile players will rise to the occasion.", "At a more detailed level, we have set up committees like the Sambamurthy Committee to advise us on how to expand mobile banking in India through encrypted SMS based funds transfer in any type of handset.", "I should emphasise the need for banks like the ones represented in this room to move beyond simply opening bank accounts to ensuring that poor customers are confident and comfortable enough to use them.", "Innovation in reaching out to the underserved customer, rather than simply posting higher numbers in branches or bank accounts opened, has to be part of our efforts.", "And last but not least, with have to deal better with distress; The natural, and worst, way for a bank management with limited tenure to deal with distress is to \"extend and pretend\" to evergreen the loan, hope it recovers by miracle, or that one's successor has to deal with it.", "The natural incentive for a promoter to deal with distress is to hold on to equity and control despite having no real equity left, and to stand in the way of all efforts to resolve the underlying project while hoping for an 'Act of God' to bail him out.", "Not all bankers and promoters succumb to these natural incentives but too many do.", "We have to ensure that the system recognises financial distress early, takes steps to resolve it,
