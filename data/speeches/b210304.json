and financial stability policies.", "Figure 5: Asset prices in New Zealand and around the world Source: Bloomberg, REINZ Before talking directly to the impact of the Bank's policies, I briefly allude to the many factors including the level of interest rates that impact on both housing affordability and house prices (Figure 6).", "Recent studies have identified housing supply as the most significant determinant of house prices in New Zealand, with responsive housing supply essential for ensuring positive and sustainable housing outcomes.", "Likewise, housing demand factors can influence house prices, but increasing or suppressing housing demand generally only has a temporary impact on house prices and affordability.", "Ensuring house prices are sustainable, thus requires coordination and consistency across many government policies and agencies and non-government participants.", "Table 1 provides a simple snapshot of the many policy levers that can influence the

ways.", "Housing demand affects the demand for housing-related goods and services, such as property construction, rents, and property maintenance.", "These components account for around one quarter of the Consumer Price Index weight the target index for the Committee's Remit.", "The level of interest rates also influences asset values, including house prices, and the decision to own or rent a house.", "In particular, house price variations influence households' spending decisions, and eventually economic growth, inflation, and employment.", "effect' is especially strong in New Zealand given that equity ownership in housing represents more than two-thirds of New Zealand households' total wealth.", "And, higher house prices relative to the costs of house building will also encourage increased building activity.", "These factors add up to a complex relationship between monetary policy, housing affordability, and house prices.", "For example, the current low interest rates are simultaneously contributing to both a rise in house prices while also improving housing affordability.", "The latter occurs through the lift in employment and household incomes and the lower debt-servicing costs of mortgage borrowers.", "Financial stability policy and housing Asset (including house) price volatility poses risks to financial system soundness.", "This is why, for example, retail banks actively manage their lending.", "They need to RBNZ estimate: Household balance sheet ($m) - C22.", "Estimate includes housing, land, and rental properties.", "ensure their balance sheets (and economic returns) are not unnecessarily vulnerable to variations in both house prices and households' ability to service their mortgages.", "These risks to financial system stability become particularly acute when many mortgage borrowers are highly indebted - relative to either their incomes and/or home values.", "The risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans is further exacerbated when banks provide a large amount of credit to higher-risk borrowers, in particular housing investors.", "It is easier to enter and exit ownership of an investment property as you are not the occupant.", "Bank balance sheets overly exposed to higher-risk investment property loans is a recipe to amplify house price volatility.", "The recent rapid rise in higher-risk house lending in particular high-LVR investor lending is largely why the Reserve Bank recently reinstated more stringent Loan-to-Value Restrictions (LVR).", "The Reserve Bank also has a number of other financial (prudential) tools which we are continuously reviewing to assist us to maintain financial stability.", "These include shining a light Financial Stability on financial risks (mostly via the twice-yearly Report); imposing capital and liquidity requirements on banks; stress testing sheets; and supervising banks as to how they manage their financial exposures.", "Even then, when it comes to economic equality, our financial stability (macro-prudential) tools have significantly different relative impacts over time.", "For example, higher prudential requirements generally imply higher deposit requirements, lower credit ceilings, and/or higher interest costs for the mortgage borrower.", "While these factors can suppress house prices over the short to medium term, they can disadvantage lower income and lower wealth households more immediately.", "The relative benefits and costs of our financial stability actions vary over time horizons.", "Media Release, February 2021: Financial stability strengthened by firmer LVR restrictions New policy goals and consideration In line with its recently announced housing policy objectives, the Government issued a the Reserve Bank's financial stability policy direction to require to have regard to \"support[ing] more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock which would improve affordability for first-home buyers\".", "We welcomed the direction as it makes specific how our financial stability policies and actions can assist the Government's housing policy objectives, while operating consistently with our financial stability mandate.", "We are mandated to promote a sound and efficient financial system, under section 68 of the Reserve Bank Act.", "The direction is also in line with our recent advice to them in which we detailed the many influences on house prices, including the actions of the Reserve Bank.", "We will be considering our financial stability policy settings via our prudential tools like loan- to-value ratios, bank stress testing, and capital requirements against particular types of mortgage lending.", "This is done with a view to moderating housing demand, particularly from Minister's request investors, to best ensure house price sustainability.", "We also welcome the for more information and analysis on debt-to-income ratios and interest-only mortgages, and will respond in due course.", "Monetary Policy Committee's Importantly, the remit targets remain unchanged.", "We remain focussed on maintaining low and stable consumer price inflation and contributing to maximum sustainable employment, as recently outlined in our Monetary Policy Statement.", "The Bank will be required to outline, amongst other things, the impact of its decisions on the Government's housing objectives.", "This MPC Remit adjustment sits well with our long-standing commitment to transparency about our policy actions and approaches.", "The Government's policy objectives for the housing market includes: \uf0b7 Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, and dry and affordable home to call their own - whether they are renters or owners.", "\uf0b7 In the short to medium-term, support more sustainable house prices by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which will allow additional opportunities for first-home buyers.", "\uf0b7 Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is wellplanned and well-regulated.", "Media Release, February 2021: RBNZ supports focus on housing Media Release, December 2020: Reserve Bank's response to Minister of Finance Government's direction The creates important work for the Bank, both on our own and in collaboration with other government and non-government organisation.", "The multifaceted nature of the housing market necessitates a multipronged response.", "For starters, the Bank (and our colleagues and stakeholders) will need to develop a collective understanding of what 'sustainable house prices' and how 'having regard to' means, fits within our broader financial stability mandate (section 68 of our legislation).", "We will also discuss the effectiveness and efficiency of our current financial stability tools at influencing actual house prices toward 'sustainable' levels, and of course managing the public's expectations of our time horizons.", "This work and understanding necessitates us 'occupiers' 'investors' viewing the housing market from both an and an perspective.", "The decision largely comes down to whether to rent or buy a house.", "To assess a sustainable house price, we need to understand how buying a house (and hence servicing a mortgage) stacks up against paying rent over the long-term.", "Buying implies you will own the house at the end of the mortgage period, hence it is a form of compulsory savings in a single asset.", "In a purely financial sense, this decision would depend on expected rental costs versus mortgage costs, plus expected capital gains in the house versus other forms of investing/saving.", "Of course there are also a broad range of additional considerations, including the availability of housing in the location of choice or need, and factors associated with the sense of long-term belonging to a community.", "From an perspective, we need to understand how decisions to build new homes or buying existing ones fit into an efficient investment portfolio.", "There is a wide universe of asset classes readily available to savers/investors, with a range of expected risk and return are limits to 'how much is too much' of any one asset class, characteristics.", "And, there including residential property.", "This means we should be able to financially-explain what an 'optimal' allocation of savings/investment to residential investment property would be.", "The drivers of residential property investment can then be explained by factors influencing expected risk and return such as, for example, the ability to leverage (a 20% deposit on a house implies 5:1 leverage), tax (dis)advantages of competing investments, and/or myopic investment behaviours leading to under- over-investment.", "I view the recent section 68b - financial policy - directive from the Government as a significant in the Bank's capabilities display of confidence and operational independence and transparency.", "It places a high level of trust in the Reserve Bank to apply our analysis and tools to support a specific objective sustainable house prices - while remaining within our legislated mandate.", "The directive is also provided with a clear understanding that we are only one of the many stakeholders that influence the demand for, supply and price of houses.", "I have covered a lot of ground today with a necessary light touch.", "The economic environment, the roles of monetary and fiscal policy, the challenges of building and operating new monetary tools, the perennial concerns related to excessive financial risk taking, and issues of income and wealth inequality.", "We have been reminded that with low global inflation, and hence low neutral interest rates, our new monetary policy tools will become increasingly mainstream.", "We have also been reminded that fiscal and monetary policy coordination remains critical to economic wellbeing.", "In New Zealand our institutional relationships are strong, providing complementarity of fiscal and monetary actions.", "This collaboration has been supported not deterred by clarity around the Reserve Bank's purpose and operational independence.", "Our ability to engage and communicate in a manner which all New Zealanders can understand remains key to our ongoing success.", "And, we have much to learn and communicate ahead.", "I encourage your interest and participation in our work.", "I hope you can at least feel my desire to lead a modern Central Bank that has the vision of operating as at the Best Bank'.", "As I said at the beginning, tahi' means
