Organization of joint trainings in getting acquainted with respective functions; \u2022 Acquaintance with and discussion on manuals and procedures requiring the commitment of both institutions in certain cases, and the testing of these procedures.", "The Bank of Albania and the Deposit Insurance Agency are working for enhancing this cooperation constantly.", "A number of legal and regulatory alterations that are being prepared in parallel by both our institutions, and the exchange of information, as well as more frequent contacts between both institutions serve this purpose.", "It is aimed at adopting best practices in this area, and at implementing the recommendations given by specialized assessments of international financial institutions that assist this process.", "Allow me to state once more that the Bank of Albania is completely committed to provide all the necessary assistance for strengthening the capacities of the Deposit Insurance Agency in Albania, in view of its very important mission.", "I wish good proceedings to this seminar."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Deposit Insurance", "Banking Supervision", "Financial Stability", "Risk Management", "Bankruptcy", "Legal Framework", "Regulatory Framework", "Deposit Protection", "Financial System", "European Integration"]}
