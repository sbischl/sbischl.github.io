an issue repeatedly mentioned this morning 2.", "Ensuring financial stability 3.", "Going the distance with structural reforms In this challenging period of very strong capital flows and expectations of continuing strong capital flows, or as one economist has called it the whipsaw of huge capital movements, the question is - do monetary authorities still have the firepower and yet be market-friendly in their policy responses?", "To this, my response is yes.", "The BSP has recognized long ago the need to deploy a deep toolkit in addressing the contemporary challenges confronting emerging market central banks that are at the receiving end of strong capital flows.", "It has used a variety of instruments to achieve low and stable inflation, prevent excessive volatility in the exchange rate and maintain broad financial stability.", "As a result of BSP's signature circumspection, the evidence suggests that the sizable FX inflows have not led to significant adverse macroeconomic and financial consequences.", "\u2022 Reserve accumulation in response to the surges in capital inflows does not appear to have led to excessive money creation.", "\u2022 The limited impact of capital flows on monetary aggregate growth suggests that sterilization policies have been broadly effective.", "Credit growth has not contributed to macroeconomic imbalances, as inflation has remained low.", "A second - and related - challenge is the need to ensure continued financial stability.", "The recent global financial crisis showed that sole focus on price stability is not sufficient to attain macroeconomic stability.", "Policymakers need to deliver more than stable prices if they are to achieve sustained and stable growth.", "Price stability does not guarantee financial stability.", "The BSP, therefore, is attentive to pressure points that could impact on both price stability and financial stability.", "To ensure financial stability we have utilized prudential measures to manage capital inflows and moderate, if not prevent, the build-up of excesses in specific sectors and in the banking system.", "Prudential policies are the instrument of choice and employed as the first line of defense against financial stability risks.", "Given the current regime of low interest rates - driven in large part by the surge of foreign capital into domestic financial markets and the limited absorptive capacity of the economy in the short term - the BSP is keeping a watchful eye on developments in the asset markets.", "We pay particular attention to what is happening in the equity and property markets, as these markets are interest-rate sensitive and could be prone to bubbly behavior.", "We see that while activity in these markets has been buoyant, the key indicators are growing broadly within trend, reflecting both cyclical as well as structural or fundamental forces.", "It is also important to note that indebtedness in the Philippines is still quite low.", "Domestic creditto-GDP ratio at 50.4 percent (Q4 2012) still ranks one of the lowest in the region.", "suggest that the risk of excessive leverage is less and the threat to financial stability is likewise lower, should asset prices correct.", "The third challenge involves going the distance in the pursuit of the reform agenda.", "We are implementing the capital adequacy framework of Basel III in January 2014.", "We will also be closely studying the other building blocks of the Basel III reform agenda to see how and when we can incorporate these into domestic regulatory environment.", "Capital market reform will be a priority.", "This will include ensuring that an appropriate market infrastructure is in place.", "The infrastructure will not only improve the quality of markets, which will help mitigate financial stability risk.", "But infrastructure will also promote the absorption of the inflows, which will ultimately lead to an expansion of the economy.", "By improving financial intermediation in the system, a well-functioning capital market will help unlock the economy's productive potential and strengthen its capacity to withstand shocks.", "Right now, we see an economy that is on an even keel, on surer footing, poised for higher growth, riding on a momentum of change that offers the promise of not only stronger growth but also one that is more inclusive and more durable.", "The challenge is to keep the momentum of positive change strong.", "The appropriate response to current favorable winds is not to sit back and relax, not to pop champagne corks as William asked this morning, but to treat them as an ideal opportunity to strengthen the underpinnings of the economy's foundations.", "The BSP will strive to have monetary policy that will provide an environment where credit and liquidity growth will remain supportive of economic growth while maintaining price stability.", "We will also continue to work on reforms that will deepen the financial system.", "We will continue to monitor financial and asset markets and be responsive to emerging risks.", "We will continue to work with the government in pushing the agenda for reforms to ensure macroeconomic stability."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination"], "topics": ["macroeconomic stability", "capital flows", "fiscal policy", "monetary policy", "financial stability", "growth", "inflation", "structural reforms", "Basel III", "credit growth"]}
