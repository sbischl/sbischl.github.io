large part, to the closure of one food processing company.", "Based on information for October, the spate of retrenchment has continued apace during the last quarter of 2011.", "Bank credit data have also reflected the depressed economic conditions.", "Total commercial bank credit outstanding declined steadily since early 2009, led by a sharp contraction of business credit.", "A slow turnaround in consumer credit started in October 2010 and there are indications that the decline in business credit may be finally bottoming out.", "\uf0b7 Consistent with the pick-up in consumer credit, there were signs of an incipient recovery in retail sales during the second quarter of 2011, spread over a range of consumer goods categories (dry goods, supermarkets, household appliances, furniture and new motor vehicles).", "\uf0b7 Of course, with domestic demand relatively subdued, with abundant spare capacity, and food prices showing only moderate increases, inflation remained under control, at about a 3.7 per cent rate (year on year) in October 2011.", "\uf0b7 In the external sector, after two consecutive years in which non-energy exports to CARICOM declined, there was a 25 per cent increase in these exports in the first half of 2011, compared with 2010.", "However, reflecting the sluggish domestic demand (noted above), non-energy imports declined by 18 per cent in the January-June period.",

billion in FY2011 (about 3.6 per cent of GDP).", "If the last few years are a guide, the final figures for FY2011 are likely to show a much smaller deficit, as government revenues are revised upwards and final government expenditure is revised downwards.", "Even so, I believe that the overall stance of fiscal policy in 2011 was appropriate, given the need to promote economic recovery and the country's comfortable public debt position.", "I would now like to turn to the outlook for 2012.", "First, let's clarify that the external conditions are expected to be uncertain, at best, or most

run-up to the Presidential elections, is likely to postpone effective policy action - setting the stage for another year of anemic growth and continued high unemployment.", "The implications of these conditions for our regional economies have already been mentioned i.e.", "- no major improvement in economic activity, and perhaps, the need for more austerity measures to address their high debt burdens.", "Here at home, certain domestic factors seem to suggest an improved outlook for 2012.", "\uf0b7 First, as noted earlier there is some evidence of a slow recovery in the demand for bank credit, including by business firms.", "\uf0b7 Second, since the end of the last fiscal year, there are indications of a modest improvement in central government project implementation.", "\uf0b7 Third, while we cannot claim to have conducted a scientific survey, our discussions with several private sector representatives, suggest that the latest budget (along with the attempts to deal with security concerns) have given a cautious boost to private sector confidence.", "Based on these underlying assumptions and a modest turnaround in the energy sector, the Central Bank's projection is for real GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent in 2012, although the balance of risks are tilted on the downside.", "Let me elaborate a bit on this projection.", "In the energy sector, \uf0b7 The expectation is for a continued decline in crude oil production, largely because of the ageing of the oil fields.", "However increased exploration is expected to stimulate activity in the energy services sector.", "According to industry sources, the ongoing safety upgrades and maintenance work that affected output in 2011, should be completed by the first quarter of 2012.", "This would allow for gas production and petro-chemical output to return to 2010 levels.", "The projections provide for no new plants coming on stream.", "In the non-energy sector, we make the aggressive assumption that construction activity will finally begin to recover, based on the implementation of certain public sector projects - the highway to Point Fortin, the HDC housing repair programme, the three mega sport facilities announced in the budget and some smaller construction projects, for which contracts are expected to be awarded soon.", "Continued delays in settling the arrears to contractors, could however dampen these expectations.", "In our discussions with the private sector, we did not get the impression that any major new investments were on the cards for 2012.", "Many business people were hopeful, however, that increasing demand, both from the domestic market and from CARICOM, would facilitate a rise in capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector current levels - now about 66-68 per cent.", "In principle, the tepid recovery, after three years of economic stagnation, should not have a major impact on employment.", "However, the projects that the Government has targeted for implementation are expected to be highly labour-intensive, a fact which could ease the current unemployment problem somewhat.", "I should note also that an increase in real GDP of 1.5 per cent should not, in itself, re-kindle inflation pressures because of the existence of considerable spare capacity.", "Barring weather-related setbacks or a new round of commodity price shocks, inflation should remain at around 5 per cent in 2012.", "There are several downside risks to the Bank's GDP projection for 2012.", "The most obvious is a pronounced worsening of the international environment, which would affect our energy and non-energy exports and weaken consumer and business confidence - the kind of scenario, we faced in late 2008 and the first half of 2009.", "Moreover because the recovery in 2012 depends so heavily on a strong fiscal impulse, bottlenecks in the project implementation (for example, arising from problems in the procurement system or delays in raising financing) also represent a serious downside risk to the GDP projection.", "I would like to conclude with some thoughts on economic policy challenges for the medium term.", "While the advanced economies have been facing difficult economic times, several Latin American countries - most notably Brazil, Mexico, Peru - are now enjoying high rates of growth with reduced vulnerabilities because they have established strong fundamentals, sound policy frameworks and prudent macro-economic policies.", "These countries have recognized that in the current volatile global environment, there is need for sizeable buffers, to be achieved through prudent fiscal policies, low public debt and adequate savings.", "It is my view, and I have said it before, that we need to move to a more sustainable fiscal position, even as we prepare for a gradual reduction in our dependence on energy sector taxes.", "This strategy will require a combination of measures to increase nonenergy tax collections and concerted efforts to reduce the share of subsidies and transfers in total government expenditures.", "This kind of fiscal consolidation will allow a return to fiscal balance, while leaving adequate room for productive investment in education, health and infrastructure.", "It will also permit an increase in the rate of savings in the Heritage and Stabilization Fund.", "We also need to find a way of pursuing a meaningful diversification of the non-energy sector that promotes an expansion in non-energy exports and a broadening of our non-energy export markets.", "Currently, the bulk of our exports are directed to the US, the UK, and the Eurozone.", "The conventional wisdom is that, over the medium term, growth in these traditional markets would continue to lag behind the more dynamic emerging market economies - China, India and Latin America.", "The greater diversification of regional exports of goods and services towards these new growth poles, would make our non-energy sector less vulnerable to the kinds of shocks experienced in the past few years.", "Ladies and Gentlemen The latest budget has underscored the importance of public-private sector partnerships in the transformation of our economy.", "It has proposed a new financing mechanism through the Junior Stock Exchange and has again offered Government facilitation to gain entry into new export markets.", "It is high time that we stop talking about diversification and actually start doing it.", "If we are to ensure our country's long-term economic viability and secure its economic future, it needs to
