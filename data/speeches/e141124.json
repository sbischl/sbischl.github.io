overall - achieves far better results than a gold regime could.", "Here, if you will allow me, I would like to return to the present day with a brief digression on the gold initiative I mentioned before.", "Although the advocates of the initiative do not wish to return to a gold standard, they do want to increase the role of gold within the currency reserves.", "They therefore demand that the SNB hold at least 20% of its assets in gold, that it sell no more gold and that it store all its gold in Switzerland.", "The initiative is both unnecessary and dangerous.", "It is unnecessary because, under the current monetary order, there is no link between price stability and the share of gold in the SNB balance sheet.", "Thus, the objective of price stability has been better achieved over the past few years than at times when the gold share was significantly higher.", "Moreover, compared to other countries, the SNB still holds high stocks of gold.", "It definitely values gold, as a part of its currency reserves, and has no plans to either purchase or sell gold.", "Finally, we are enormously vigilant in ensuring that our gold is stored safely in every respect, both in Switzerland and abroad.", "The initiative is dangerous because it would weaken the SNB.", "The connection between a minimum share and a ban on selling which it embraces would very greatly restrict our monetary policy room for manoeuvre, since the SNB only retains its full capacity to act when it is in a position to adjust its balance sheet to monetary policy requirements - in other words, if the SNB can expand or shrink it - without any restrictions.", "The value of this flexibility in reality has been impressively demonstrated in the past few years by two measures which allowed us to avert substantial damage from our country.", "First, the SNB supported the country's biggest bank by establishing a stabilisation fund, thereby stabilising the Swiss financial system.", "Second, it combated the massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc by introducing a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 to the euro.", "With the minimum share of gold and the selling ban demanded by the initiative, enforcement of measures like these would have been very much more difficult.", "Consequently, the initiative would make it considerably harder for us to intervene with determination in a crisis situation and fulfil our stability mandate.", "For this reason, the gold initiative could result in worse money instead of better money, totally in contradiction to the intentions of the originators.", "Introduction of plain money A popular initiative is also behind the third reform idea - the introduction of plain money.", "Nowadays, the SNB and the commercial banks together provide the economy with money.", "Through credit creation, the banks are in a position to create book money, only a small part of which they are required to cover with SNB sight deposits.", "In everyday life, this book money - for instance deposits in salary accounts - is generally accepted in the same way that cash is accepted.", "A plain money system would mean that banks had to cover 100% of their book money with SNB sight deposits.", "The people behind the initiative believe that this would simplify monetary policy because a plain money system would allow the SNB to manage the money supply with utmost precision.", "Moreover, plain money is thought to increase the stability of the financial system because deposits are secured by SNB sight deposits.", "In addition, profits from money creation would accrue fully to the SNB and no longer, in part, to the banks.", "Although the idea of plain money may be interesting in certain respects, I am sceptical as to whether acceptance of the initiative would result in better money.", "My reticence is born not only of considerable doubts as to the anticipated benefits of plain money, but far more because the introduction of plain money would constitute an enormous experiment for which we lack any experience or comparative figures from the past.", "Never in monetary history has a country introduced plain money based on central bank money.", "Assumptions which appear plausible could therefore prove to be incorrect.", "Foreign money instead of our own money The final proposal is considerably less challenging in theoretical terms, but is highly explosive politically.", "Is there any reason why Switzerland should maintain an independent currency for its relatively small territory and conduct its own monetary policy?", "Since Switzerland has close economic ties with other currency areas, and the central banks in question also pursue stability policies, the idea of importing monetary policy from abroad would not be so far-fetched at first glance.", "After all, there are examples such as Denmark and Hong Kong which voluntarily and unilaterally peg their money to foreign currencies, even though they still mint their own coins and print their own banknotes.", "They hand over their monetary policy de facto to a foreign central bank and have often had quite good experiences with this approach.", "However, as soon as we look at the situation a little more carefully, surrendering monetary policy autonomy appears considerably less favourable from a Swiss point of view.", "First, our country has had good experience with its independent monetary policy, and this differentiates us from countries where the adoption of foreign monetary policy has brought a real gain in terms of stability.", "Second, structural and economic differences continue between the currency areas, irrespective of all the interrelationships, and these are decisive for the effectiveness and apportionment of monetary policy.", "Equally, the preferences of the general public as to how the central bank should react to given challenges vary from one country to another.", "This also speaks in favour of a national monetary policy and against delegation.", "Consequently, in my opinion, the use of foreign money would not result in better money in our country, in the current situation.", "At this stage, you might object that, through the minimum exchange rate against the euro, the SNB has already, in point of fact, adopted foreign money and handed over its monetary policy to a foreign central bank.", "Such a view of affairs would be incorrect.", "The minimum exchange rate is a measure which we adopted in order to fulfil our mandate in the interests of the country as a whole.", "The world economy is currently in an extremely difficult situation and the minimum exchange rate allows us to maintain appropriate monetary conditions and secure our long-term capacity to act.", "The minimum exchange rate is therefore an expression of our national policy sovereignty and the SNB's lived independence, not a sign that we have given up our autonomy.", "The power of monetary policy Despite the criticism of these four proposals, I attach importance to making two things clear.", "First, it is absolutely possible and, as history has shown, even probable, that over the course of time the situation could change in such a way that the assessment of specific points might change.", "However, whatever these changes might be, the aim of the monetary order should remain unchanged - to ensure sound money in the interests of the public at large.", "Second, the reform proposals I have discussed are fundamental questions which, ultimately, cannot be decided on by a representative of the SNB but by voting citizens.", "In our democracy, they are the ones who have the final word, either indirectly through their representatives in the Federal Parliament or directly at the ballot box -

both intended and non-intended - are usually easy to foresee.", "At the moment, this is more difficult because we are obliged to use unusual instruments.", "Consequently, at times like this the SNB bears a particularly high level of responsibility.", "We are therefore subjecting the impact of the measures we have taken so far to repeated and very fundamental review, and are approaching this task with a completely open mind.", "I would like to conclude my presentation to you as follows.", "The SNB is fighting for price stability with total conviction and great commitment, while at the same time keeping the development of the economy in view.", "Within the context set by our monetary order, the SNB does its utmost, through its monetary policy, to ensure that our money retains its value, thereby remaining a sound pillar of our society.", "This is the SNB's most important contribution to ensuring the long-term attractiveness and competitiveness of the Swiss location, as well as the social cohesion of our population.", "By their nature, central banks tend to be conservative institutions.", "Yet in recent years, the central banks, including the SNB, have become quite creative and innovative when faced with difficult circumstances.", "However, two points need to be noted in this respect.", "On the one hand, central banks must never lose sight of their mandates.", "There should never be any doubt about their unflinching adherence to their stability mandates.", "On the other, it is important to recognise that monetary policy cannot be used to solve all economic problems.", "Otherwise we run the danger that, in the long term, monetary policy will no longer achieve its intended effects, and our money will deteriorate.", "As far as the Swiss monetary order is concerned, I am confident that the SNB is in a position to fulfil its mandate in the interests of the country -
