in broad terms - is why bank lending rates have been creeping up again in Ireland.", "(I won't speak today about important details such as the cross-subsidization between tracker mortgages and other lending.)", "Given how intimately dependent bank lending rates are on the rates at which the government can borrow, let me say a word about the government's borrowing costs and how those have been affected by market sentiment in recent weeks.", "Right across Europe, for the past several weeks, the fiscal pressures in the Greek economy have been heightening investor concerns.", "This resulted in Greek debt being traded in secondary markets at record yields.", "Despite the negotiation of a large financing package sufficient to deal with the Greek government's borrowing needs for three years, and assurances that Greek government debt would remain eligible to back commercial bank access to liquidity at the ECB, market concerns remained high.", "Indeed, they tended to spill over into the markets for the debt of other countries with high borrowing needs.", "The functioning of interbank and other short-term markets was also hampered.", "Irish government debt did not escape this pressure, though it was not the most affected.", "The symptoms intensified during last week to the point where some financial markets seem to have become quite dysfunctional.", "It was clear that decisive action was needed.", "The action decided upon on Monday morning had three main goals: -

part of it of course attributable to the global crisis, and not just to the bursting of our own bubble.", "This exercise involved working with the banks, but challenging their estimates of loan-loss based on our own more realistic - some may say pessimistic - credit analysis.", "(I am over-simplifying the exercise, as it also looked at other elements of the profit and loss account over the coming years).", "The conclusions of this exercise are worth emphasizing.", "To my relief, and slight surprise, it turns out that most of the banks started the boom with such a comfortable cushion of shareholders' funds that they would be able to repay their debts on the basis of their own resources.", "This includes the two big banks.", "It is because of this fact - that their shareholders' funds will remain positive through the cycle - that one of them, Bank of Ireland, has already been able to tap the private market for an additional equity injection.", "Of course they do need additional capital to move forward, but, as has happened in the US and elsewhere, the government's capital injections of last year into these two institutions looks like being well-remunerated.", "This takes account of the low prices being paid -

and those in need of better public services - will be picking up the sizable tab for their deficiencies.", "What I do want to emphasize is that - huge though it is - the net deficiency of these two banks does not impose a burden on the government's budget that could justify recent interest rate yield spreads on Irish government bonds.", "INBS accounts for about \u20ac21\u20442 billion in net budgetary costs.", "With the NAMA purchases not yet completed, I can't quite narrow the Anglo figure down precisely.", "However, rounding up recent estimates to be on the safe side, it would be a pessimist who would put the taxpayer's net cost above \u20ac25 billion.", "That is a huge sum, and it's unconscionable that it could have arisen.", "(I will have more to say about this in my report to the Minister for Finance at the end of the month).", "The main point today, then, is to stress that the cost is manageable.", "Shocking, if you want, but manageable.", "I make no excuse for using that word.", "It is important that everyone, at home and abroad, recognizes that this is a sum that is not a game-changer in terms of the public finances.", "It represents about one year's borrowing requirement at current rates.", "It is not destabilizing.", "The plan is that, when this has been accomplished later in the year, the markets will come more to realize that the banks' losses no longer represent any threat to the public finances, and that this is no longer a factor that should cause them concerns about investing in Irish government paper.", "This will be good both for the banks' ability to mobilize loanable funds, and for the government's ability to fund its continuing, though steadily contracting, borrowing requirement.", "After all, it is the underlying gap between tax revenue and government spending that represents the main pressure on the government's finances and that has resulted in the bulk of the recent heavy borrowing.", "Staying on course to reduce this underlying deficit is absolutely crucial to ensuring that confidence in the public finances can be maintained and strengthened."], "classifications": ["none", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "none", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none"], "topics": ["banking system", "public finances", "credit availability", "confidence", "government borrowing costs", "bank lending rates", "fiscal adjustment", "banking losses", "capital reserves", "NAMA"]}
