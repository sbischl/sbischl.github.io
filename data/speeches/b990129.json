imports correspond to 8% of GDP - a devaluation of 50%, (i.e.", "the exchange rate stabilising at the very depreciated level of R$ 1.80), would add about 4 to 5% to the rate of inflation.", "Overvaluation of the real The use of the exchange rate anchor made an exchange rate overvaluation inevitable.", "Nevertheless we had imagined it would be possible to shift from the mini-band regime to the free floating regime in a rather gradual way, while the economy was still attracting foreign capital.", "But reality sometimes frustrates the best intentions.", "With the benefit of hindsight (after the Asian and Russian crises), the widening of the exchange rate band in April last year, which widened the amplitude of the exchange rate fluctuation by 1% per year, was a rather timid movement.", "But it is easy to be wise after the event.", "Wider exchange rate band The attempt to shift from the mini band to the wider band lasted for 48 hours.", "We knew that it had limited chances of success.", "Within four days we had lost almost US$ 6 billion in international reserves.", "And the free floating exchange rate regime, supported by a solid fiscal stance, has become our new objective.", "The idea of widening the band under the model designed and issued as of January 13th was good, but unfortunately it came too late.", "Centralisation of Foreign Exchange Transactions Suggestions about centralising exchange market operations shock me.", "Because centralising exchange market transactions in the central bank amounts to having no foreign exchange regime, it leads the country to the moratorium, with the re-negotiation of debts.", "Credit lines to Brazil would be cut.", "It means violating the rules of the game.", "It would be a completely arbitrary act which would have terrible consequences.", "The first semester of this year will be hard.", "But I believe that from next year we will achieve high rates of growth -
