{"sentences": ["I am pleased to be here today at this international gathering of experts who share a common interest in the economic development of Saudi Arabia.", "The theme of this Conference is \"Financing a Changing World\" and I intend to share with you my views on the role that the Saudi Banks and the Capital Market are playing in this regard.", "This gives me an opportunity to recap the important contribution of our banks and our growing capital market in channeling the financial flows to and from the Kingdom.", "I will also outline the future direction and challenges in this regard.", "In recent years, international fund flows have been affected by different phenomenon, including rising imbalances in trade balances originating from the export dominated economies in Asia, the pace of economic growth in developed economies in Europe and North America, and the volatile energy and commodity prices affecting all countries.", "Addressing the impact of these global phenomenon are causing significant challenges to the economies of all countries.", "For the Gulf region including Saudi Arabia, a major challenge is to ensure that the increased financial flows into the region are channeled efficiently to the most productive sectors of the economy and to profitable enterprises and projects.", "Unlike the earlier decades, when Gulf countries were obliged to recycle their additional revenues into the global economy due to limited absorptive capacity in the region; currently, existing and projected needs of this region indicate that a significant percentage of the additional flows can be invested and put to many productive uses in the local economies.", "Also, the Gulf countries wish to continue to be attractive to international financial flows in form of foreign direct investments to encourage partnerships and for transfer of knowledge and technology.", "This is essential for deepening and broadening the economies and opening of new

markets turning into a contagion that can affect an entire region.", "It is, therefore, imperative that a domestic financial system is strong enough to cope with the increased risk associated with globalization in general and integration of the financial markets in particular.", "Against this backdrop, we are well positioned in Saudi Arabia to have a strong financial system that is serving the economy well.", "The system that has evolved over the years is broad-based and has a variety of institutions providing a wide range of financial services to savers and investors.", "It is efficient, technologically advanced, well-supervised and working on sound principles.", "It has demonstrated its strength and resilience during the Gulf conflicts in the 1990 and in 2003, and various financial crises in the past decades.", "On all occasions, its stability has remained uncompromised The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) is at the apex of the Saudi financial system.", "It has almost completed fifty years of its existence.", "Over these years, it has played a crucially important role in the consolidation and development of the Saudi economy, by evolving a monetary system for the country based exclusively on national currency, striving for the promotion and maintenance of domestic price and exchange rate stability, and promoting the growth and ensuring the soundness of the financial system.", "It has also been managing the Kingdom's foreign exchange reserves, besides acting as a banker to the government.", "Before I describe the important contribution of commercial

inflow of capital for domestic investment.", "Since its establishment in 1952, a major responsibility of SAMA has been to maintain financial stability and promote growth of the national banking industry.", "As far as SAMA's objective of maintaining a stable financial system, its achievements have been equally remarkable.", "SAMA has followed prudent policies aimed at creating a sound, stable, and efficient financial system.", "Such a system has been characterized by freedom of capital flows, open investment climate, availability of ample liquidity, competitive environment and a modern payment system.", "Over this long period, sound laws and regulations and timely supervisory actions have ensured that Saudi Banks have stayed strong with adequate capital, efficient management, fit and proper directors and managers and sound internal control systems.", "This is a remarkable achievement in the face of global and regional uncertainties, political and economic crises, wars and conflicts and the volatilities of the oil and currency markets.", "SAMA's focus on achieving and maintaining financial stability is premised on the belief that it is a fundamental precondition for sustained and dynamic economic growth in which all market participants are able to make optimum contribution to the economy.", "Financial stability not only promotes efficient domestic investment

Arabian Riyal Interbank Express System (SARIE), an electronic fund transfer system, instituted in May 1997.", "These technological developments have contributed significantly to improving the level of quality of consumer services, reducing costs, enhancing efficiencies, and strengthening controls.", "They have created a strong and sophisticated technological platform for a quantum leap in electronic banking and financial services in the new millennium.", "Together with SAMA, commercial banks still constitute the backbone of the Saudi financial system.", "Along with the growth of the

83.7 percent.", "Their average risk-weighted capital to asset ratio, during this period, has generally exceeded 20 percent which is considerably higher than the minimum of 8 percent recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.", "In recent year, Saudi banks have become increasingly involved in the domestic economy.", "During 1997-2006, they liquidated a part of their net foreign

prices.", "Nearly 95.8 percent of domestic credit represented banks' claims on the domestic private sector which went up by 233.1 percent over this period.", "During this period, there was a sharp

"Saudi banks have also been investing in government securities, thereby contributing to the development effort of the government.", "However, these investments as a percentage of total assets have declined from 21.8 percent in 1997 to 14.3 percent in 2006 due to the government's recent policy of retiring some of its debt.", "With the establishment of the CMA, there has been a considerable increase in the depth and breadth of the Saudi Capital Market.", "The trading activities of all participants relating to the Saudi Stock Exchange over the past few year have increased manifolds and,

been active both as borrowers and lenders to Saudi counterparties.", "In the 70's and 80's, their main role was to act as a conduit for transferring the surplus funds and liquidity in Saudi Arabia to international financial markets.", "However, with the expansion of economic activity and increasing demand for credit, many regional and international banks have participated in direct and syndicated

are becoming increasingly apparent.", "Privatization initiatives noted earlier will also require investment of tens of billion of riyals.", "In addition, the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure in the various sectors will require significant pools of capital.", "A rough estimate of the financing needs of the projects announced so far by the Government over the next 10 years exceeds USD 500 billion.", "However, the way that these financing needs are met by the Banks and capital markets in future is likely to be different.", "First, these projects and initiatives will require longer term financing which will be difficult to finance through traditional bank loans.", "Second, it will require a mixture of equity and debt obligations.", "Third, the funding could be multi-currency and attract multinational institutions and investors.", "Fourth, it could take form of various types of capital instruments, not yet seen in the Saudi and regional capital market including corporate bonds, debentures, mortgages, subordinated loans, preferred shares, etc.", "Also, there will be an opportunity to raise funds through Islamic finance instruments such as Sukuks and
