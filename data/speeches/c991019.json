increasing.", "Additionally, corporate profits have started picking up.", "In this situation, corporate sentiment has continued to improve.", "Such positive developments in corporate profits and

adjustment as well as an increase in prices of some products closely related to international commodities, such as those of petroleum products.", "Consumer prices continue to be unchanged.", "Corporate service prices are still falling, although the pace of the decline is slowing.", "As regards the movements of overall prices in the future, they are likely to be flat, as the rise in crude oil prices to date will continue to be passed on to prices of other products for a while.", "However, substantial narrowing in the output gap led by a recovery in private demand is unlikely for the

attitude.", "However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capital base has eased considerably.", "Under these circumstances, major banks have gradually become more active than before in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.", "However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak.", "In addition, some firms have been trying to reduce debts using their on hand liquidity.", "As a result, credit demand in the private sector has continued to be weak, and thus private banks'
