how it draws on different skill-sets amongst directors, how it sets strategies, and how it interacts with senior management to build knowledge and make decisions in the interests of shareholders.", "Well-functioning boards aimed at sustained performance are in truth work-in-progress in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia - we probably have more distance to cover in this regard than in compliance with rules.", "Many companies do not have a good mix of experience and skills amongst their directors.", "While some of the bigger companies may have the necessary resources and can seek outside help, there are a large number of companies that require help along this journey.", "We should therefore focus our energies not just on formulating sound rules and best practice codes, but on encouraging and helping companies to address practical issues in making their boards effective and high-performing.", "Corporate governance study commissioned by MAS and SGX This is one of the reasons why MAS and SGX jointly commissioned a study on improving the implementation of corporate governance practices in Singapore.", "This study was carried out by Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen of the National University of Singapore's Business School and the Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Centre.", "The study focused on assessing the current state of corporate governance practices in Singapore and proposing practical measures to improve board effectiveness and governance.", "Details of the study can be found in the report, which MAS and SGX will be publishing on their websites later today.", "For now, let me highlight two particular areas of the study's recommendations that we have started working on.", "Professional development and training of directors One area of improvement is in the training of directors.", "Having committed and skilled directors is a key component in the effective functioning of the board.", "Director training is particularly relevant for new or first-time directors, to assist them in understanding their roles and responsibilities, and to equip them with the necessary skills.", "Even experienced directors need to continually upgrade their skills, to oversee and steer companies in today's rapidly changing and globalised landscape.", "MAS has been in discussion with the Singapore Institute of Directors on how we can build on its very useful work to date, and develop a comprehensive and sustained approach to training and development of directors in Singapore.", "MAS will help to fund a study that will help to operationalise this comprehensive approach to training.", "The study will cover a few areas.", "First, it will look into benchmarking directors' training and development against best practices in other leading jurisdictions.", "A number of jurisdictions have in the last few years developed extensive structured training programs for directors.", "Secondly, it will examine possible collaborative arrangements between a range of organisations and training providers.", "Thirdly, it will also focus on how best such training initiatives should be financed.", "This is an important initiative to ensure our companies have skilled directors on their boards, who can help them to grow and expand in the region, and be recognized leaders in both performance and governance.", "Developing practical guides for listed companies and directors A second issue arising from the study has to do with developing practical guides for listed companies and directors.", "This is in line with helping companies help themselves on the path to better corporate governance, MAS will work with industry and professional bodies on practical guides on areas of interest to companies.", "The importance of an effective audit committee in particular was highlighted in the corporate governance study by Professor Mak.", "It noted that almost all corporate scandals involved some form of financial impropriety, with the audit committee often seen to be part of the governance failure.", "Some guidance on the roles, functions and skills required by an audit committee would be useful.", "We need to encourage well-qualified directors to take on the critical responsibility of being a member of an audit committee.", "Such practical guidance notes could be useful in helping directors on audit committees to understand their roles relative to that of senior management.", "It could also provide better focus on how they can add value by enabling the important interaction between strategy and financial and accounting controls.", "I note that the UK has issued similar guidance on Audit Committees -
