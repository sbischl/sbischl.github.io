for higher investment returns, which would in turn, increase the demand for Shariah-compliant assets in Asian markets, including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.", "Reflecting this trend, GCC banks

since 2010.", "Singapore is home to Sabana REIT, which is the largest Islamic REIT globally by asset size.", "In 2013, Sabana also launched a corporate sukuk programme in Singapore to help finance its

alone3.", "The asset-backed nature of Islamic finance makes sukuk ideal for financing of infrastructure projects and would complement ongoing work by Singapore to enhance the bankability of infrastructure projects in the region and involve more capital market participants.", "In the meantime, it will be important to continue to strengthen key foundations such as global regulatory standards and best practices for Islamic finance, and capacity building and talent development.", "To facilitate further growth of Islamic finance in Singapore, MAS is working with the industry and other government agencies to provide clarity and certainty in the regulatory and tax treatment for sukuk.", "For example, some industry players have suggested that pre-approved standardised templates
