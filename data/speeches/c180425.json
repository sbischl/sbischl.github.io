"Ultimately, substance matters much more than form.", "Of course, clarity of roles and responsibilities is important.", "It is also important that a front line business feel accountable for managing the broad set of risks confronting it.", "Indeed, one of the benefits of the three lines of defense model is that the business lines think more expansively about the risks they face, beyond just traditional notions of credit and counterparty risk.", "But an effective risk manager worries less about whether her firm's risk management framework exactly matches the theory of the three lines of

ordinary, human biases -including the ones I just mentioned-and organizational culture can help you present options in a manner that yields better results.", "In the world of risk controls, individuals face choices every day-choices whether to walk right up to the line of appropriate behavior and risk crossing it; choices to get more or less compensation in exchange for riskier behavior;

unwittingly, but other times on purpose.", "For all these reasons, good processes are necessary but not sufficient.", "There will be situations in which your employees have to make choices.", "Ignoring the moral dimension of choices carries significant risk.", "If you want your organization to be well controlled with regard to its risk, you have to consider the quality of choices, not just the reliability of processes.", "An organization should therefore develop the capacity of its employees to make good choices, not just permissible choices.", "So, how do you practice moral reasoning?", "Bill Dudley has offered what I thought was a good starting point.", "Get rid of the notion that a separate morality applies at work than at home.", "Bankers-and, for that matter, lawyers-cannot check their morals at the door when they step onto a trading floor or into a courtroom.", "Here are some other ideas, courtesy of a 2016 report by the Financial Conduct Authority entitled \"Behaviour and Compliance in Organizations.\"", "The report argues, among other things, that ethical considerations need to remain salient in order to promote good choices.", "Salience can be achieved by prompting about moral codes-through language that emphasizes words like \"moral,\" \"ethical,\" and \"good.\"", "Discussions by leaders and key culture carriers-that is, esteemed colleagues regardless of rank in a hierarchy-can also help if they address ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of business decisions.", "Finally, salience occurs through proximity of decision-makers to those affected by decisions.", "So, look for ways to make the human consequences of choices more apparent.", "In my view, a habit or culture of considering what is right, and not merely what is permissible, will help any organization attract, retain, and develop high-quality employees.", "It will promote individual wellbeing and will contribute, over time, to an industry that makes fewer errors of judgment.", "Above all, remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.", "So your organization now has three lines of defense-great!", "But your work is not over.", "You still have to question whether your organization can be better controlled vis-a\u0300-vis its risks.", "The challenges and opportunities facing your firm do not stop changing.", "You need to adjust accordingly.", "I encourage you to ask questions about the three lines of defense model and how it is applied in your organizations.", "Here is one of the questions on my mind: How do the three lines of defense take account of advances in technology?", "Technological solutions in financial services are becoming cheaper, faster, more easily available-almost off-the-shelf-and help make your business more efficient and profitable.", "But do you know how these solutions work?", "Chances are, not really.", "I certainly do not, but then I'm just a lawyer.", "There may be a tendency to believe that brilliant people built and tested the product.", "Surely they know better than you or I about how it works.", "We should therefore just trust the experts.", "I have seen this movie before.", "Similar assumptions existed a decade ago about CDOs and other complex securitizations and hedges.", "It has been said that the financial crisis occurred because of a failure of imagination-of not anticipating risk.", "There was also a more basic failure.", "Not enough people understood how complex financial products actually worked.", "It is critical that all three lines of defense-and, especially, the first line of defense-understand technology.", "I urge you to question your current technology, and to think ahead to further changes.", "For example, how will artificial intelligence challenge traditional methods of testing and assurance, which address static coding rather than dynamic learning?", "How will machine choices about access to financial services, or the cost of those services, avoid perpetuating or exacerbating historical disparities of race, gender, age, or zip code?", "These questions do not have easy answers, and they will likely lead to more questions.", "Keep learning so that you can better anticipate risks.", "Professionalism and the first line of defense Finally, I encourage you to continue to develop a sense of your field as a profession.", "Now, I do not mean to imply that anyone in this room is unprofessional.", "But, like many others, I see a role for professionalism in finance.", "The Banking Standards Board in the United Kingdom is a thought leader in this field.", "According to its most recent annual review, which I recommend to you all, \"[P]rofessionalism comprises the attitudes, judgement and high standards of behaviour, knowledge and skill expected of individuals working in banking.", "[G]reater professionalism in banking would help create a sector that, now and in the future, better met the needs and expectations of its customers, clients, members, employees, the economy and wider society.\"", "In my view, various aspects of professions have a lot to offer.", "The eligibility requirements for many professions improve the likelihood that a practitioner will meet standards of competence and behavior in her professional conduct.", "These requirements cover character, prior record, and reputation-not only skill or education.", "Members of professions also benefit from codes of conduct that transcend specialized practices.", "These principles offer an ethical framework within which to tackle problems that are not easily resolved by narrow rules or processes.", "They make it easier to make and stick with good decisions.", "Gatherings in which members of a profession can come together and exchange ideas and opinions are crucial.", "They help members of a professional community keep up to date on important industry-wide developments and raise issues that present the need for collaboration.", "They also help to instill a shared sense of purpose and responsibility for carrying out the goals of the profession.", "A profession can also provide personal accountability.", "Lawyers, for instance, can be disbarred, and complaints against them can become matters of public record.", "That is added incentive to maintain the skills, character, and other qualifications required to become (and remain) a member of the bar.", "And, critically, professions do not stop improving.", "Lawyers continue-I hope-to seek a more just society.", "Doctors, a healthier one.", "I do not mean to call for the equivalent of the legal bar for bankers-although it might not be a bad idea.", "But there are elements of professions that could be useful.", "For example, forums like this one facilitate information sharing and promote a sense of community.", "A code of professional conduct is another example.", "Again, I refer you to the work of the Banking Standards Board, which has developed a \"Statement of Principles for Strengthening Professionalism.\"", "Like Bill Dudley, I have argued that banking would benefit from a misconduct database.", "Records of employee misconduct would be available to future employers to combat the so-called \"rolling bad apple\" phenomenon.", "Hopefully this would encourage more careful choices by bankers in the same way that the risk of disbarment prompts lawyers to think about the long-term consequences of their decisions.", "None of these ideas is a magic bullet.", "But they may be helpful as you consider how the first line of defense and the financial services industry develop as a profession.", "Conclusion: professional courage Let me end with one final thought on professionalism.", "Looking back at the financial crisis and more recent scandals, there must have been people who recognized early that what was happening was wrong, but remained silent.", "As the first line of defense develops and convenes in gatherings like this, it is important to remember one other professional value: courage.", "Professional courage is key to the appropriate functioning of lawyers inside corporations.", "In what has been called the \"partner/guardian\" dilemma-a bit of a misnomer since the \"dilemma\" is really a good thing-lawyers are supposed to assist the firm in its mission and protect its longterm reputation, its good name as a store of value.", "That takes courage, especially when an action is technically legal but otherwise wrong or just plain stupid.", "Your roles in the first line of defense also require professional courage.", "You are partners in your business.", "You are also guardians of your firm, the investment of its shareholder owners, the trust of its customers, and the expectations of public authorities.", "That is not an easy task.",
