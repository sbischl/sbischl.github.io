which is why a forum such as this one can be very helpful in illuminating the potential pitfalls of well-intended corporate governance proposals.", "Some unintended side-effects might include high compliance costs, ambiguous liabilities, or reduced innovation.", "It is counterproductive to make disclosure so onerous as to make the cost of compliance prohibitive or impractical.", "Regulations and standards, whether by regulators, government, trade groups, or the companies themselves, should not impede the ongoing process of innovation.", "Rather we must ensure an environment that is conducive to effective and efficient operations.", "A credible case can be made that we should focus on principles as the bedrock for rules.", "We should establish key principles against which corporate decisions should be evaluated, regardless of whether or not a certain type of behavior is prohibited.", "In this way, when innovations make old rules obsolete, corporate leaders would have to consider not only whether some action would violate the law but whether it would violate a principle of good corporate governance.", "Rules are clearly necessary but they cannot replace ethics and exemplary leadership.", "Timely and regular flow of information to stakeholders is the grease that engenders trust.", "In elevating the standards of corporate governance in any sector, shareholders must play an active role to engage boards and hold them accountable.", "But for this to happen, shareholders, and indeed consumers, must have adequate and relevant information on the performance of their organizations.", "To conclude, I want to re-emphasize that good corporate governance is critical to the health of the business sector, our financial system, and the wider economy.", "Our economy will be stronger if corporate decisions are made with competence and integrity, and if shareholders and the public can appropriately assess the profitability and riskiness of corporations' business activities.", "I thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Corporate Governance", "Board of Directors", "Oversight Function", "Directors", "Non-Executive Directors", "Accountability", "Transparency", "Sarbanes Oxley Act", "Financial Institutions Act", "Compliance"]}
