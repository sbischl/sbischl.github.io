pick-up in activity, with quarterly growth rates of 12-13% in each of Q3 and Q4.", "These increases were driven, in large measure, by the assumption of a phased relaxation of lockdown measures, and accompanying policy support, between July and September.", "To my mind, two paths are possible in the second half of the year.", "One involves a negative feedback loop from higher unemployment to lower spending, the other a positive feedback loop from higher spending to lower unemployment.", "The first poses a downside risk to the outlook, the second an upside risk.", "As things stand, it is unclear which of these scenarios, or feedback loops, will prove the more potent.", "The negative loop has its roots in the labour market.", "So far, levels of employment appear to have fallen less rapidly than output.", "Against that, the number of furloughed workers has exceeded expectations, perhaps by in excess of a million people.", "This is good news for household incomes in the short run, as the income loss from furlough is far lower than from unemployment.", "Indeed, this might help explain some of the greater than expected strength in demand in Q2.", "As the furlough scheme tapers from August, however, there is a risk this greater number of furloughed workers are not hired back by employers, adding to the unemployment pool.", "The May MPR scenario had unemployment rising to 9%, but assumed the risk of workers not being re-hired was small.", "Recent survey evidence, from both households and companies, suggests this risk could be larger.", "For example, survey evidence of companies by the DMP suggests private sector employment could be almost 10% lower by the end of 2020, implying an unemployment path somewhat higher than in the May MPR scenario.", "If unemployment was to rise more than expected, it increases the risk of a negative feedback loop.", "Joblessness, or fears of it, have historically been a key driver of household savings.", "Higher unemployment, as well as lowering incomes, could cause households to increase precautionary savings.", "That higher saving would lower demand and negatively affect company revenues and employment, in a vicious cycle.", "John Maynard Keynes described this dynamic in the 1930s as the \"paradox of thrift\".", "A paradox because prudent decisions by households, given the risks they face, have the perverse collective consequence of increasing risks to the economy and those same individuals.", "These dynamics might be particularly potent at Cumulative loss calculated as the percentage difference in the four-quarter

households face double jeopardy risks to their lives and their livelihoods.", "Elsewhere, I have called this dread risk.", "At present, dread is double-barrelled.", "Yet this is not the only path possible for the economy.", "The willingness of companies to take back furloughed workers will depend importantly on their expectations about future demand for their goods and services.", "The stronger those expectations, the lower the likelihood of job losses.", "Firms will not make workers redundant if they need to rehire them, at a cost, soon afterwards.", "This lowers unemployment risk, raises household incomes, confidence and spending and thereby boosts firm revenues and employment, in a virtuous cycle.", "Back in the 1950s John Hicks called this dynamic a \"super-multiplier\" - \"super\" because the cumulative effects are amplified when emerging from recession.", "There is survey evidence to support this dynamic.", "The British Chambers of Commerce's weekly survey suggests demand and employment intentions have moved upwards in lockstep since April (Chart 11).", "Indeed, employment was close to balance by mid-May.", "Surveys of employment intentions and vacancies have also recently recovered from low levels.", "Notes: Chart shows BCC Quarterly Survey and dashed lines show more recent weekly survey after Covid-19 crisis began.", "A further mitigating factor is that household savings rates appear to have risen, involuntarily and significantly, due to social distancing policies.", "A Bank of England survey in conjunction with Ipsos Mori suggests the aggregate saving ratio is broadly unchanged, although with considerable heterogeneity across income cohorts (Chart 12).", "But it is possible these survey respondents did not capture the involuntary increase in cash balances when they answered questions about their savings behaviour.", "For example, sterling deposits held by households and companies in banks have increased sharply over the past few months, by around \u00a3120 billion (Chart 13).", "That is consistent with a significant rise in the saving ratio.", "These higher involuntary savings could be drawn down to finance future spending, at least by some households.", "In aggregate, they potentially dwarf any voluntary rise in savings for precautionary purposes.", "Notes: Research was carried out by Ipsos MORI on behalf of The Bank of England.", "It surveyed a nationally representative quota sample of 2,243 adults in the United Kingdom aged 16-75 using its online i:omnibus on 29 May to 3 June.", "Data has been weighted to the known

the MPC observed that the balance of risks to the outlook was skewed to the downside.", "Subsequent positive news on demand has, in my opinion, more than counterbalanced the rise in downside risks to employment.", "To my mind, this leaves risks to the outlook slightly more evenly balanced than in May, if still with a downside skew.", "\"The Fourth Quarter\" Looking beyond 2020, there is plainly a high degree of uncertainty about the economy.", "That in part reflects uncertainty about the virus and the policy responses to it.", "But it also reflects uncertainties about the path of the economy itself.", "Given the depth of the recession, there is likely to be a greater than usual degree of history-dependence, or hysteresis, in this path.", "The deeper and longer the recession, the greater the the economy's productive potential.", "scarring effects on physical and human capital and hence The May MPR scenario captured some of these scarring effects.", "In particular, it assumed that lower investment as a result of the Covid crisis was not recovered, leaving the capital stock 4% lower.", "Combined with some drag on total factor productivity (TFP) growth, the level of output ended 11\u20442% lower.", "That scenario assumed no scarring effect on human capital, however, with unemployment returning to pre-Covid levels and the long-run rate of unemployment unchanged at around 41\u20444%.", "At the same time, it was recognised that this was just one of many possible paths for the economy.", "Other paths would give rise to differing degrees of scarring to physical and human capital and losses to the long-run productive potential of the economy.", "On 14 July, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) will publish three possible scenarios for the economy involving different degrees of depth and length of the downturn.", "Perhaps the key uncertainty, from a scarring perspective, concerns the labour market.", "As Chart 2 illustrates, the Covid crisis has had markedly different effects on different sectors and, most likely, will continue to do so.", "Chart 14 compares different sectors' contribution to the pre-Covid employment boom and its subsequent output contraction.", "There is a negative correlation, suggesting it might be difficult for the sectors which absorbed most workers pre-Covid to repeat this feat post-Covid.", "Chart 14: Falls in

companies to invest in machines rather than people during the recovery.", "The price of capital goods has fallen while the price of labour has increased because of the need for Covid-secure premises and practices.", "This shift in the relative price of capital versus labour will provide a headwind to the re-absorption of workers.", "A second structural headwind concerns the skills mix of those losing their jobs.", "Research suggests this is likely to be skewed towards those with fewest skills and least experience, especially the young.", "The Resolution Foundation estimates that high unemployment will result in a 13% lower probability of a new graduate being in employment three years after completing education.", "For those without a university qualification, the probability of being in work three years from now might be 27-37% lower.", "During jobs recessions, many workers choose to move down the skills spectrum to regain a foothold on the jobs ladder.", "But if many displaced workers have low levels of skill and experience, the option of moving down the skills spectrum may not be available or may at least have lower value.", "Skilling or re-skilling will then be needed.", "This adds to the time it takes workers to re-enter the jobs market, prolonging high unemployment.", "The possibility of labour market mismatches, whether by sector or skill, increases the chances of high unemployment proving persistent, with scarring effects on the economy's supply potential.", "Put differently, market mismatches raise the economy's NAIRU - labour the level of unemployment at which supply bottlenecks and wage pressures re-emerge.", "The higher the NAIRU, the smaller the degree of slack in the economy.", "Historically, pandemics have not tended to have a persistent upward impact on prices.", "But a higher NAIRU would be one reason to be cautious before jumping to that conclusion.", "A second is that the policy response to the Covid crisis, both monetary and fiscal, has been significantly more expansionary than any previous pandemic.", "A third factor is that the fracturing of supply chains during the Covid crisis, national and international, would tend to increase the cost of goods and services, if it proves durable.", "Against these inflationary forces of course needs to be weighed the disinflationary effects of much higher degrees of (double jeopardy) uncertainty, weaker demand and potentially higher saving rates in the economy.", "With heavy weights on either end of the inflationary see-saw, it is unclear at this stage which will tip the balance.", "Those uncertainties are, to some extent, reflected in the differing responses of agents' inflation expectations.", "expectations have tended to drift up, companies' expectations have Since the crisis, households' drifted down and financial markets' expectations are relatively unchanged.", "Given the strong forces acting on inflation in either direction, the MPC is being especially vigilant in monitoring trends in inflation expectations.", "Perhaps the long-range forecast about which I have greatest confidence concerns the data and statistics used, by the Bank and others, to monitor the economy.", "The emergence of a new suite of fast indicators, including from the UK Office for National Statistics, has significantly shifted the technological frontier when monitoring the economy.", "That shift is likely to be permanent, improving the granularity and the timeliness of both our statistics and our understanding of economic trends.", "The Policy Response Let me conclude by discussing the policy response to these searing developments in the global economy.", "Like the crisis itself, these responses have been unprecedented in speed and scale.", "As importantly, they have typically involved fiscal and monetary policies acting in tandem to cushion the effects of the crisis on jobs and incomes.", "The first line of defence against the crisis has come from fiscal policy.", "Fiscal tools act directly on the source of the problems caused by the Covid crisis cash-flow shortfalls for companies and jobs risks for workers.", "To those ends, a wide variety of fiscal measures have been put in place over recent months, including job support schemes, tax rebates and holidays, grants to certain sectors and loan guarantee programmes.", "For the major economies, these programmes has been as large as any since the Great Depression, often double-digit percentages of GDP (Chart 15).", "Additional support will come from the automatic stabilisers built

loosen it further.", "I judged the upside news in demand since our previous meeting in May to have outweighed the negative news to the economic outlook.", "Let me illustrate my thinking with a simple thought-experiment.", "In the May MPR scenario, inflation and output fell sharply in the first year before recovering, with the output gap closed by year 2 and inflation back to target by year 3.", "Since then, positive demand news has lifted the starting level of UK output.", "If this level was maintained along the same growth trajectory, the average output gap over the next three years would be 3 percentage points smaller than in May.", "With a Phillips curve slope of a third, inflation at years 2 and 3 would be around 1 percentage point higher than expected in May.", "Another significant piece of news since May has been in asset prices.", "Since then, shorter-term interest rates have fallen by around 25 basis points, risky asset prices such as equities have risen by almost 7% and the sterling exchange rate has fallen by around 21\u20444%.", "Taken together, these asset prices movements represent a material loosening in UK monetary conditions.", "On standard ready-reckoners, they would boost output by around 1\u20442%, and inflation by around 0.2 percentage points, at the policy horizon relative to the May scenario.", "Finally, imagine we plugged this news about the expected output gap and inflation into a standard Taylor Rule, in which interest rates are mechanically set in line with these two factors.", "Assuming weights on the two terms of 0.5 and 1.5 respectively, the Taylor Rule implied path of interest rates would, on average, be around 1 percentage point higher over the policy horizon as a result of the news about asset prices and demand, relative to the May-implied scenario path.", "This is of course not the only news about the UK economy since May.", "And nor am I inviting too literal an interpretation of my thought-experiment.", "I offer it simply as a means of sizing the upside news to the economy since May, illustrating its presumptive implications for monetary policy and providing a baseline against which downside risks to the economy can be judged, including from higher unemployment.", "It was this judgement that lay behind my decision to leave the monetary stance unchanged at the June meeting.", "Looking ahead, risks to the economy remain considerable and two-sided.", "Although these risks are in my view slightly more evenly balanced than in May, they remain skewed to the downside.", "Of these risks, the most important to avoid is a repeat of the high and long-duration unemployment rates of the 1980s, especially among young people.", "Like the rest of the MPC, I stand ready to adjust monetary policy, at speed, if needed to support the economy and return inflation to its target on a sustainable basis.", "At the same time, it is important to recognise the limits to what monetary policy can achieve.", "Monetary policy can help to deliver the monetary and financial conditions necessary to support households and businesses - and is doing so.", "But monetary policy can do relatively little to avoid problems caused by structural or sectoral shifts in the economy, such as structurally high rates of unemployment.", "With interest rates along the yield curve close to zero, there is also simply less room for monetary manoeuvre than in the past.", "\"dependency culture\" around monetary Before the Covid crisis, I expressed concerns about the growing policy.", "Recent events have done nothing to allay those
