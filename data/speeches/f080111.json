issues.", "Major problems and challenges at the current stage I.", "Major problems in the real estate market Though the real estate market and the real estate financial businesses develop rapidly, we have also noticed that recently such acute problems as excessively rapid growth of housing prices in certain cities, irrational supply and demand structure, inability of low-income people to afford housing, etc.", "Commercial housing price has been on the rise.", "As of October 2007, the y-o-y growth of sales prices in 70 large-and-medium-sized cities averaged at 9.5%.", "Sales prices of newly

persistent price hike and slow development in small-and-medium-sized house lease market make it difficult for low-income households to purchase or rent houses in the market.", "The above problems, though limited to certain localities and created by structural imbalance, have huge impact on society due to the following reasons.", "First, mismatch between supply and demand is acute.", "From the demand side, there is a continuously strong demand as a result of higher income and faster urbanization.", "From the supply side, the insufficient aggregate demand is coupled with imbalanced mix of housing available and shortage of supply of small-and-medium-sized apartments.", "From January to October 2007, floor space completed stood at 232 million square meters, up 8.8% y-o-y.", "Sold space grew by 33.1% yo-y to 489 million square meters, 2.11 times of space completed, resulting in a slower growth of supply than that of demand.", "Second, shortage of residential construction land and

year beginning, up 34.87% over the same period of last year.", "Competition is extremely fierce, creating huge underlying risks.", "At present, real estate loans, especially individual housing loans, are classified as prime assets.", "To take more market share, local offices of some commercial banks lower lending criteria, reduce examination steps and relax investigation through distorted practice.", "As a result, banks assets become less secure.", "In 2006, competent authorities find out after sampling and surveying housing loans in 16 cities that on average 22.31% of borrowers didn't meet loan officers directly when getting loans.", "Mortgage refinance loans and additional mortgage loans are granted without proper approval.", "The multipliers of mortgage refinance loans and additional mortgage loans generally fluctuate with the value of real estate, likely to magnify housing credit when the economy grows and housing price soars.", "In addition, most credit is used to purchase more houses or to invest in the stock market, creating more potential risks to the banking system and accumulating more bubbles in the real estate and stock markets.", "As of end-August 2007, outstanding mortgage refinance loans and additional loans in 16 major cities reached 41 billion yuan, 3.5 times of that in the same period of last year.", "Weak loan management unveils risks

on difficult-to-sell buildings through \"fake mortgage\".", "Attach great importance to lessons drawn from real estate markets in other countries Real estate markets in many countries and regions have experienced cyclical fluctuations or even bubble bursts.", "This is particularly true in recent years when some developed countries and developing countries are on the downside of the curve after continuous price hike.", "A few of them are exploring measures to achieve \"soft landing\", which deserves our close attention.", "The real estate bubble in Japan in the 1990s, real estate bubble in Hong Kong after the Asian financial crisis and the sub-prime crisis this year in the US are well known.", "Some valuable points can be summarized after in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the above crises and other problems in the international real estate market.", "First, real estate industry is an important driving force or a pillar industry for a country or region.", "Real estate industry concerns over 50 other industries, so the development of the real estate industry closely relates to the overall economic growth.", "When economy is in the upside curve of the cycle, the real estate industry grows continuously.", "But when economy goes downward, real estate industry experiences shrinking investment and consumption.", "If real estate bubbles burst due to economic or political factors, housing prices will plummet before economic slowdown at a faster rate than overall economic growth, inflicting greater impacts on consumer confidence and economic growth than any other industry.", "Second, real estate industry is a typical capital-intensive industry, and its development provides space for financial development and innovation.", "However, real estate industry influences the financial sector.", "If banks fail to prevent risks associated with real estate loans, relax lending criteria, and grant more individual mortgage loans and development loans, then bubbles are likely to appear or accumulate, whose burst will threaten the banking system or even financial security, and further influence economic, social and political stability.", "Third, housing is a basic need for people's livelihood as well as a public good.", "It is necessary for the government to adopt guarantee measures, and for financial institutions to perform social responsibilities.", "However, new risks will be triggered if banks are allowed or encouraged to provide excessive loans to low-income households.", "Before the sub-prime crisis in the US, most low-income borrowers were too optimistic about their income and applied for loans that they couldn't afford to repay.", "But the market is volatile; the running of the economic cycle is not at the control of borrowers.", "When income shrinks or interest rate resets, borrowers will have to pay more, and potential risks translate into actual crisis.", "Fourth, securitization and credit derivatives have played a positive role in terms of diversifying home loan risks, expanding real estate finance to more financial institutions and other institutional investors, and diversifying risks in the banking system.", "However, if commercial banks, investment banks, institutional investors, auditors and rating agencies are myopic and weak in information disclosure, risks connected with real estate finance are likely to be covered or underestimated.", "In the US sub-prime crisis, underestimation of the risks associated with sub-prime loans-backed securitization products or credit derivatives makes the sub-prime crisis unnoticeable, abrupt and highly contagious.", "Fifth, it is necessary to improve or relax financial control in order to fully display the fundamental role of the financial market in resources allocation and to provide a favorable environment for financial innovation.", "However, governments shall master the laws governing the functioning of market.", "If governments don't perform market supervision, early warning and forward-looking risk guidance, they will fail to prevent risks from happening.", "Sixth, in the process of economic integration, it is a logical choice for developing countries to open up to the outside world and utilize foreign capital in order to achieve fast economic development.", "However, due to surplus liquidity and cross-border capital flow, foreign capital will have a greater impact on domestic capital markets, especially the markets in countries and regions that experience persistent economic growth and local currency appreciation, which are more likely to fall prey to hot money.", "Earnestly strengthen real estate credit management In recent years, the PBC and CBRC have issued a series of policy guidelines and supervisory regulations in accordance with state policies on housing development and consumption, with the purpose to promote the healthy development of the real estate financial businesses and to prevent financial risks.", "Not long ago, in order to accomplish the tasks put forward in the urban residential housing work conference, the PBC and CBRC jointly issued the Notice, which specifies the requirements on how to strengthen commercial housing credit management.", "Regulation of real estate credit is emphasized from different perspectives: 1) stricter management of real estate development loans; 2) strengthened management of housing consumption loans, especially prohibition of mortgage refinance loans and additional mortgage loans for unspecified purposes and fluctuating with the valuation of real estate; 3) guidance of individuals' consumption and investment and higher minimum down payment ratio and lending interest rate for second home mortgages; 4) inclusion of solely foreign-invested commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks into the regulatory policy system; 5) strengthened credit information management in the real estate sector to fully leverage the credit information system that includes both enterprises and individuals.", "Recently the PBC and the CBRC issued the Supplementary Notice in accordance with housing consumption policies and other policies at the state level.", "First, the number of home loans is calculated by households (including loan applicants, their spouses and children).", "In China, housing is a necessity for family life, so it is more reasonable to calculate the number of home loans by households, both in line with our national situation, and conducive to the enforcement of the Notice, guidance and promotion the reasonable allocation of real estate resources and strengthening the macro-regulation of the real estate industry.", "Second, given the reasonable demand of residents to improve their living conditions, households having purchased the first home with loans whose per capita residential space is lower than the local average level, first home loan rate applies if such households apply for a second mortgage, so as to curtail irrational demand (including speculation) and improve people's living conditions.", "This policy is consistent with the Notice.", "After borrowers present information of total living space certified by real estate administrative authority according to their registration information, commercial banks decide whether first home loan rate shall apply against living space information, residential permit and other documents, while the average per capita residential space comes from last year's figure released by statistics department.", "Second home interest rate applies to re-borrowers who don't conform to the above conditions.", "Third, the Supplementary Notice prescribes that housing provident fund loans are also subject to the Notice.", "Either housing provident fund loans or commercial loans are the liabilities of households.", "Housing provident fund loans will not exempt from market volatility.", "Therefore, second home loan rate applies to households who are in housing provident fund loan scheme and who are applying for commercial loans.", "There are some requirements concerning how to further implement the Notice and the Supplementary Notice.", "First, reach a common understanding.", "Regional offices of PBC, CBRC and commercial banks shall carefully study the spirits of the 17th CPC Congress and Central Economic Work Conference, implement the scientific approach to development, exercise tight monetary policies, strengthen regulation over real estate credit, improve management of real estate credit risks, speed up real estate credit restructuring, drive forward real estate financial innovation so as to promote the healthy development of the real estate market.", "Second, streamline risk management stipulations.", "Headquarters of commercial banks shall improve and unify bank-wide real estate credit management stipulations, and all their branches and sub-branches shall grant real estate loans in strict conformity with such stipulations.", "Units and staff responsible for real estate financial businesses shall explain lending policies to their customers in order to safeguard the seriousness of credit policies.", "Third, make sure that all relevant policies are put in place.", "Principles and polices on real estate credit regulation are specified in the Notice and Supplementary Notice.", "Mortgage refinance loans and additional mortgage loans shall be eradicated steadfastly to achieve zero mortgage refinance without specific information or real transactions and zero additional mortgages.", "Commercial banks shall refrain from accepting applications with false information or certificates, and notify local banking associations.", "Fourth, improve financial services for protective housing development.", "Commercial banks, in addition to improving commercial credit risk management, shall restructure the credit mix to give priority to ordinary commercial housing and affordable housing and households capable of making repayment and applying for loans to buy self-occupied houses.", "At the same time, commercial banks shall improve their services for affordable housing and low-rent housing in the preconditions of risk control and in accordance with the state housing guarantee system.", "Improve the low-rent housing system, regulate the construction and distribution of affordable housing and earnestly do a good job in housing guarantee for low-income households.", "Fifth, go on with real estate financial innovation.", "Real estate finance is an important part of financial innovation.", "If we attributed sub-prime crisis to financial innovation, we will run the risk of mistaking the phenomenon as the root cause.", "In recent years, real estate financial innovation has made initial achievements through concerted efforts.", "We should summarize experiences, continue to push ahead with financial innovation, improve the efficiency of resources allocation, identify and diversify financial risks in the real estate sector so as to promote the healthy development of the real estate financial market."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary-financial
