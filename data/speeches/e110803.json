or if evidence suggested - that a zero rate would solve our country's unemployment problem or speed up the recovery without causing other adverse consequences, I would support it.", "However, monetary policy is not a tool that can solve every problem.", "In today's remarks, I will outline my current views on the economy, and suggest what alternative options and policies our leaders might consider as we search for ways to build a stronger, more resilient economy.", "U.S. economic conditions First, it is a testament to the U.S. economic system that even as this nation carries a heavy public and private debt burden, the economy is completing its second year in recovery.", "The level of activity, as measured by GDP, has now surpassed its pre-recession peak after growing at a nearly 3-percent pace last year.", "However, I am concerned that in working to offset the effects of this devastating crisis and to restore the economy to health, an extended zero-interest-rate policy is producing new sources of fragility that we need to be aware of and allow for in our future policy choices.", "Governments, businesses and consumers have made financial choices and allocated resources with an understanding that a zero-interest-rate policy will remain in place indefinitely.", "The longer we leave interest rates at zero, the more asset values will be defined by these low rates and the greater the negative impact will be once the inevitable move up in rates begins.", "Complicating the fragility around monetary policy, fiscal policy as a pro-growth policy instrument also appears to be approaching its limit.", "The government's stimulus efforts to support the economy, along with lower tax revenues, have resulted in historically large fiscal deficits and a very large debt level.", "Without a dramatic change, the deficit and the debt will only become more daunting with the rising cost of entitlement programs and likely higher interest rates.", "For well over a decade, the U.S. consumer has been a principal source of world demand and economic growth.", "As a result, the United States has incurred consistently large trade deficits, contributing to imbalances in the global economy.", "As we have painfully learned from the housing bust, growth built on imbalances is ultimately unsustainable.", "Circumstances require, therefore, that we transition from an economy that relies too heavily on consumption and government spending for growth toward more sustainable sources of demand and economic prosperity.", "How we undertake this transition will define our economy and country's economic future.", "To start, over the next several years, we must change our national savings, consumption and investment habits.", "Such shifts, though fundamental to long-term economic health, are admittedly difficult to accomplish.", "They require changes in behavior and expectations.", "They involve dramatic shifts in resource use, which are not painless as workers are temporarily displaced and industries are disrupted.", "The pain is immediate, and the payoff comes slowly.", "However, the gains also can be significant, as more sustainable long-run economic growth is well worth the effort and sacrifice.", "In a recent visit to Singapore, I witnessed that nation's commitment to job creation.", "For example, during the recent crisis and recession, Singapore developed a program to retrain unemployed workers to ensure they would have the skills needed when its manufacturing sector recovered.", "As is well understood, workforce training matters.", "I spoke with individuals who described the drive to bring new factories on-line, with the goal of bringing a factory online with minimal delays and, by their description, without compromising safety.", "Lessons from Germany Other countries have made similar changes out of necessity or during a time of economic distress such as we are experiencing today.", "Countries have made deliberate choices and not relied on chance to change economic incentives and behavior that served to improve economic performance.", "I'm not advocating that we pick winners and losers -
