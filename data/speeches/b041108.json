{"sentences": ["Introduction Asia represents the fastest growing region in the global economy.", "Of significance, is that more than half the population in Asia are women.", "The participation of women in the economy would therefore not only enhance their own economic well being but would also contribute towards raising further the economic potential of Asia.", "Women are already engaged in both the informal and formal sectors and are increasingly emerging as a more important force in the economy.", "The effective participation, however, needs to be an informed participation.",

rights and responsibilities, and their opportunities for income generation and the associated risks and costs involved.", "This is particularly important for Asia, where rapid economic and financial transformation is occurring.", "Financial literacy among women is thus a vital part of this process, not only to promote greater engagement of women in the current economic environment, but also to prepare them for the future.", "It is my great honour and pleasure to be here today to speak on the importance of financial literacy among women in Asia.", "My remarks today will first discuss some of the major structural and cultural transformations in Asia that are changing and impacting the economic environment faced by women in Asia, and their rapidly changing role in the economy.", "I will also touch on aspects of the challenges faced by women in Asia in their endeavour for greater economic engagement.", "This will be followed by a discussion on the important enablers for enhanced

and development process in Asia.", "In particular, there has been a strong migration from the informal to the formal sector, following the modernisation and industrialisation process.", "The increase in the relative significance of the financial sector in most Asian economies can be seen in terms of the momentum in the financialisation of savings and the increase in the volume of financial transactions being conducted through the formal financial sector.", "These trends are being reinforced by the shift of activities that is taking place from the traditional sectors to the industrial and services sectors.", "On average, the industrial and services sector now accounts for 74% of the economy in Asia, compared to 60% in 1980.", "In contrast, agriculture now accounts for 12%, compared

Asia, the demographic structure also reinforces the economic potential of Asia.", "The population in Asia continues to grow at a relatively high and stable rate to account for more than half the world's population.", "Of significance is the relatively young demographic structure in Asia.", "More than 50% of women fall in the age group 15 to 49 years, similar to that for men.", "This demographic structure thus not only contributes to enhance the potential of the economy but combined with rising incomes and improved standards of living, has resulted in increases in consumption

financial literacy.", "While financial literacy is important, regardless of economic status, it becomes even more important for those that are less privileged.", "For those that have less to manage, it becomes more vital to manage the finances even more effectively.", "It is also those that have been under-served by the financial system that need to be more aware of the financial services that they should be able to access, and the benefits that can be drawn from the various options available.", "They too have the same need for maximising the benefits from their limited resources, and to achieving financial and economic security.", "Strengthening their financial position becomes even more important for this target group.", "There needs to be awareness of the alternative assets that can be accumulated not only to generate an income stream but also towards building wealth.", "Of equal importance is to draw those operating in the informal sector into the formal sector, where their

place.", "This has manifested itself in increased intra-regional trade, investment flows and the increased intra-regional presence of corporations and financial institutions.", "A more recent

economy will give this segment of society increased opportunities.", "In many countries, the success of various national and international socio-economic reform programs have resulted in women becoming an increasing part of the formal economy.", "Through the concerted efforts of women's rights movements, economic policy intervention and gradual shifts in cultural norms, women today have

sophistication in financial literacy.", "As a result, women continue to face special challenges in their endeavour to be active participants in the economic system.", "Challenges women in Asia face in financial literacy Let me now turn to discuss some of the challenges faced by women in Asia in their endeavour to become more financially literate and financially independent.", "Firstly, with the socio-economic environment in Asia changing rapidly, there is greater uncertainty and volatility which represents a challenge even for financial experts.", "The financial system has also become more complex, with new risks emerging.", "This increased sophistication thus makes it increasingly difficult for those who are less financially literate to make sound decisions.", "Secondly, the advances in technology has led to a proliferation of financial products and services.", "There needs to be a greater understanding of the basic concepts and practices of banking, insurance and equity so as to know how to make choices from the wide range of financial products available, and to assess the respective risks, costs and returns.", "Also important is the basic principles of debt management, wealth management and personal budgeting to be able to understand the importance of long-term savings in funding future requirements.", "Financial literacy involves being able to identify and understand the opportunities for income generation, access to funding, and learning how to make the most of the range of financial products available.", "It also involves learning how to manage financial risks in an environment where the financial infrastructure may be under developed.", "This may relate to the laws and procedures in the country.", "Also important is the need to be able to recognize illegal schemes and other exploitative practices such as predatory lending.", "Thirdly, while women in Asia are being less stereotyped and given greater opportunities for entering into the economic mainstream, nonetheless the working conditions for women in many countries have tended to be less favourable.", "The exploitation of labour in the informal sector in some instances are particularly bad, not only for women, but also for children and minority groups.", "Women who are disadvantaged in this manner have found it difficult to escape from the trap of indebtedness.", "Frequently, the disadvantaged and those who are not able to access the formal financial system have resorted to the informal financial systems.", "Recourse to these financial sources have also been due to the lack of awareness.", "These may be in the form of deposit schemes that entail high risk, access to financing from sources that are highly costly, and almost inevitably against high collateral.", "Very often, the practices are unfair and deceptive.", "Examples in predatory lending are found to be unscrupulous and highly disadvantageous to the borrower.", "Fourthly, in some Asian societies, traditions continue to create cultural pressures that restrict a woman's choices and liberties.", "Though there is increased freedom for women to pursue education and careers, in some societies, cultural pressures still make it more difficult for a woman to get the exposure on financial matters.", "In addition, the increased incidence of divorces and single parenthood mean that more women are left to fend for themselves and their children.", "In certain Asian societies, single women may face unusual difficulties in arranging their finances.", "In some cases, a woman may even have difficulty claiming her legal rights in a contract, even though the law does not dispute such a right.", "Deeply entrenched human behaviour is not able to change as rapidly as the financial system is evolving.", "Fifthly, statistics on life expectancy confirm that women tend to live longer.", "In segments of society where women earn less than men, combined with the fact that they may live longer, it is crucial to have financial acumen in order to increase the financial independence of women.", "This trend also magnifies the need to plan for retirement especially in an era of rising medical costs.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Enabling environment for financial literacy The promotion of greater awareness and understanding in financial issues in a dynamic and constantly changing environment has to be a continuous process.", "The effort needs to focus not only on providing education programmes but also on putting in place the supporting infrastructure to enhance the access to financial services, to ensure an environment of financial transparency and disclosure as well as adequate consumer protection.", "Enhanced financial literacy is about bringing people into the financial mainstream so that they are able to make well informed decisions regarding their earnings, spending, savings and investments.", "The effort thus has to encompass a comprehensive set of strategies including the education process reinforced by the supporting infrastructure.", "The goal of any financial education programme is to increase awareness of the value of effective financial management, to show how it can contribute to financial security and improvement in the economic well-being.", "The most effective of programmes have been those that are targeted to specific groups.", "Fundamental education for greater financial literacy that will have most sustainable impact are those through the school system.", "Such educational programmes would provide the education to women from an early age.", "Essentially, it would not result in the marginalisation of anyone target group, in particular women.", "Such programmes would therefore best serve its purpose as part of the core curriculum.", "Indeed, the national education system can play a pivotal role in financial literacy within a country.", "The responsibility of promoting economic and financial literacy needs to be a collaborative effort amongst the authorities, the financial service providers and the community to connect to the different target groups including all social groups.", "These would include the lower income groups, workers and businesses.", "Important are programmes directed to families where women have an important role and to engage those we have not been able to participate fully to benefit from the favourable economic environment prevailing in the region.", "Among the successful financial education programmes are those with specific objectives that are tailored to meet particular needs.", "This includes programmes to promote savings for specific objectives; for education; or for retirement.", "The education programmes can also be linked to other objectives such as good health,

explained their rights and responsibilities.", "Micro credit institutions have also been highly successful in many countries in providing access to financial services to microenterprises.", "This will contribute towards greater reliance on the formal financial infrastructure and less on the informal structures.", "Higher level of consumer education and financial literacy must be complemented with effective disclosure regime, fair and transparent market practices, simplification of financial products and enhanced communications in the marketplace to minimise information asymmetry.", "While efforts may be taken to enhance transparency and disclosure by service providers, and while programmes for enhanced literacy can produce positive results, consumer protection is still needed.", "Given the asymmetry of information, consumers often do not have enough information to be completely protected.", "Building the confidence of consumers also requires that there be adequate avenues for consumers to seek redress to enable consumers to resolve conflicts through an equitable process.", "Also important are the requirements for complaints to be handled promptly by financial institutions.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Malaysian experience Let me briefly take a moment to share with you the experience of Malaysia in developing an enabling environment to promote financial
