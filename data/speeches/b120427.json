and in recent months faster than before (according to the CSO series on the prices of properties where the purchase is financed by banks, which refers to loan drawdown date and as such lags contracted prices).", "When will the price equilibrium be reached, and when will transaction volumes reach steady state levels?", "Given elevated levels of uncertainty, will the relative price of housing - as a risky asset - converge to a price that undershoots that which would prevail in less uncertain times?", "Even if aggregate availability of credit is not constrained by lack of liquidity or lack of capital - and the open-handed provision of liquidity by the Central Bank even through the most acute phases of the crisis, supported by the ECB, have certainly worked to ensure that there has been sufficient liquidity, while the Government has also poured in capital - could it be that more cautious mortgage underwriting (reflected for example in lower loan-to-value ratios currently being offered by those banks still active in the sector) have the effect in the downturn of depressing prices below the prospective new equilibrium (as is assumed in some credit-focused models1), even if the latter is determined more by the fundamentals of demand and supply (such as incomes, interest rates, demography, housing stock, construction costs).", "Second-guessing asset prices is not easy, but at least in the case of housing, pricing in nonboom times is not dominated by speculative considerations.", "That indeed is why the prices do not snap quickly to a new equilibrium.", "The duration of price corrections after property bubbles elsewhere has varied a lot: in Japan, prices have been falling for 82 quarters, whereas the duration of decline in the Scandinavian crises varied between 9 and 20 quarters.", "The Irish price fall so far is more of an outlier in terms of depth than of duration.", "Probably, the faster prices reach a new equilibrium, the better the outcome for the economy as a whole.", "Wealth effects on consumption are one thing.", "Also -
