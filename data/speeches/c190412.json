more efficient services for their customers.", "Indeed, fintech firms may complement the activities of community banks well.", "For example, while small businesses may value the relationships that local bankers offer, they don't like the lengthy process of filling out loan applications, waiting for credit decisions, and the time it takes small banks to make funds available.", "Those are
