depreciation of the krone veiled the underlying deterioration in competitiveness.", "In May 2000, the krone exchange rate reached its lowest level in six years.", "In the following period and until the end of 2002, the krone appreciated, and the effect of high wage growth gradually came into evidence in overall corporate results.", "Results last year were affected by a particularly strong krone in the second half of the year.", "The krone exchange rate, measured in terms of the TWI, has now returned to the level of the mid-1990s, while the business sector is still grappling with the high level of costs that has built up since 1998.", "Changes in the krone exchange rate have proved to be reversible, but the loss of competitiveness and jobs caused by the relatively high level of domestic wage growth is more difficult to recoup.", "In recent years, labour costs have accounted for an increasing share of corporate earnings.", "In 2002, labour costs accounted for more than 90 per cent of total factor income in manufacturing.", "The increase in wage shares is affecting corporate behaviour.", "The demand for labour is declining.", "Credit demand and investment in the enterprise sector are low.", "At the same time, the commercial property market is weak.", "Vacancy rates for commercial premises are high and rents have fallen.", "This will have an impact on investment in the period ahead.", "Lower interest rates will normally result in higher inflation, partly because the krone depreciates, and partly because of a rise in demand.", "Enterprises will thus be able to increase their earnings.", "Business sector activity is stimulated most effectively by low interest rates and a weak krone.", "Due to the past few years' wage settlements, households have strengthened their financial position at the expense of private and public enterprises.", "House prices have edged up after stagnating earlier this year.", "Household borrowing has moderated somewhat, but is still high.", "Against this background, growth in private consumption is expected to be fairly high in the period ahead.", "Consumer spending on goods is rising, pointing towards growth in private

growth is projected to be higher than trend growth.", "Investment activity in mainland Norway is low.", "Investment in the petroleum sector is rising, but a large share of the increase in demand is being met by imports.", "Public consumption increased sharply in 2002, but there will be little stimulus to the economy from the public sector this year.", "Growth will mainly be fuelled by private consumption in the second half of this year and into 2004.", "We expect that investment in mainland enterprises will gradually pick up from a low level.", "In order to set an appropriate interest rate, it is important to be be able to form a reasonably accurate picture of the economic situation.", "Economic statistics are the most important source of information, but they are published with a lag and some of the figures are revised frequently.", "In autumn 2002, Norges Bank established a regional network as a tool to gauge the level of activity in the Norwegian economy.", "The network consists of companies, organisations and municipalities throughout Norway.", "In the two rounds of talks in connection with Inflation Report 2/03, 450 contacts were interviewed.", "We will be having six rounds of talks each year with business and community leaders concerning financial developments in their enterprises and industries, with about 200 visits in each round.", "The selection of contacts represents the production side of the economy, both industry-wise and geographically.", "In the course of 2003, the number of contacts in the network will rise to about 1000 persons, who will be contacted once or twice a year.", "The Department of Economics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is responsible for the network in Tr\u00f8ndelag county and conducts contact meetings.", "Official statistics and current market information will continue to be the main basis for our assessments, but due to the time lag and revisions of statistics, supplementary information is useful.", "The regional network provides up-to-date information on the state of the Norwegian economy.", "Regular communication with local contacts in Norway's business and community life provides us with information that supplements available official statistics.", "It also provides us with additional information on areas not covered by official statistical sources, and we learn which issues are of particular interest to enterprises.", "Information received from the regional network supported the picture presented in the June Inflation Report: enterprises are reducing costs while households' financial position is strong.", "We are waiting to see if the results of the current round of talks will point to increased optimism in the business sector and in public entities or if the prospects for the future continue to be regarded as somewhat negative.", "Inflation is low in Norway.", "The rise in consumer prices adjusted for taxes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) has slowed primarily due to developments in prices for imported consumer goods.", "Low inflation is due to the appreciation of the krone throughout last year and low inflation abroad.", "The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has also slowed.", "This is particularly the case for domestically produced goods influenced by world market prices.", "Domestic price inflation has nevertheless remained close to 3 per cent, due to high wage growth over several years.", "In July, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.7 per cent, which is lower than projected in the June Inflation Report and substantially lower than the inflation target.", "There are also prospects that inflation will be low for some time ahead.", "The analysis in the June Inflation Report showed that a reduction in the sight deposit rate towards 3 per cent, combined with some depreciation of the krone, could bring inflation up towards the target two years ahead.", "More moderate wage settlements in the future would provide a basis for even further monetary policy easing and a weaker krone.", "Without considerable monetary policy easing, inflation might have remained too low for an extensive period.", "The short-term nominal interest rate in Norway has now reached a historically very low level.", "Interest rates have not been lower since the first nine to ten years following the Second World War.", "The real interest rate is also low, although by no means as low as it was when inflation plagued Norwegian savers in the 1970s and 1980s.", "The low interest rate must be viewed against the risk of persistently low inflation both in Norway and in other countries.", "So far, indicators of inflation expectations do not point to any substantial deviation from the inflation target of 21\u20442 per cent.", "However, if inflation should remain too low for an extensive period, there is a risk that expectations of continued very low inflation will be generated.", "It may then prove difficult to fuel economic activity by stimulating demand.", "A marked easing of monetary policy has therefore been appropriate.", "The inflation target is symmetrical.", "It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.", "Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is now neither abnormally high nor abnormally low.", "However, available statistics indicate that economic growth came to a halt during the winter.", "A global upswing will contribute to stronger growth in Norway.", "Growth is sluggish already, however, with stagnation in many business sectors.", "Since inflation is also low, a low interest rate is appropriate now.", "But it is always a question of weighing one consideration against another.", "Since December last year, monetary policy has been eased to a greater extent and more rapidly than has been customary.", "Following this phase of substantial easing, uncertainty with regard to economic developments in the period ahead has been somewhat greater than normal.", "With the easing that has been implemented, we must be particularly alert to changes in private consumption, wage growth and the krone exchange rate.", "If households expect the interest rate to remain low, private consumption may increase more than has been assumed.", "House prices and household borrowing may again accelerate.", "However, increased slack in the labour market and declining migration to the largest towns will reduce these effects.", "The risk of stronger growth in household demand must be weighed against the sluggish developments in the business sector.", "Even though the krone has depreciated from its strong level at the beginning of the year, competitiveness is still relatively weak after many years of high wage growth.", "In addition, vacancy rates for commercial premises are high and rents have fallen.", "Another risk is that wage growth may accelerate again, as it did following the interest rate reductions in 1999.", "This risk is also being reduced by a slackening labour market.", "Annual wage growth in these years was a little less than 41\u20442 per cent.", "The low pay increases in this year's wage settlement also indicate that the social partners have placed more weight on the effects of pay increases on future developments in interest rates, the krone exchange rate and employment.", "In addition, activity in public and particularly sheltered industries is probably still feeling the impact of the expensive pay increases last year and earlier years.", "We expect that in light of the experience gained in 2002, public entities will exercise more caution in future wage settlements.", "Developments in the krone exchange rate represent another source of uncertainty.", "The relationship between the krone exchange rate and the interest rate differential against other countries is not necessarily stable over time.", "Themes in international financial markets shift.", "However, the depreciation of the krone this year is contributing to stabilising inflation and activity in the economy.", "We may not yet have seen the full effects on the krone exchange rate of the interest rate reductions that have been implemented.", "At the same time, the krone can be influenced by fiscal policy and the outlook for wage growth.", "Norges Bank's Executive Board sets the interest rate with a view to achieving the inflation target of 21\u20442 per cent.", "The inflation target is also a vehicle for monetary policy's contribution to stabilising output and employment.", "When setting the interest rate, the Executive Board seeks to achieve a balance.", "The objective of stimulating growth in the Norwegian economy and achieving the inflation target is weighed against the risk of new pressures building up in the economy over the long term.", "Since December 2002, we have judged that to achieve this balance it was appropriate to reduce the interest rate to a low level.", "At the last monetary policy meeting on 13 August, it was decided to reduce the interest rate to 3.0 per cent.", "With an interest rate of 3.0 per cent, the Executive Board's assessment remained unchanged, i.e.", "that the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 21\u20442 per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.", "Thank you
