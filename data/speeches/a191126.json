it had become clear that they were too complex and led to excessive variability in risk-weighted assets and insufficient levels of capital for some banks.", "In their place, a new standardised approach has been introduced, which combines simplicity and risk sensitivity.", "We agree with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the EBA on the design of this approach - we recognise the benefit of including past losses in the new standardised approach to make it risk sensitive.", "This feature also helps to maintain a direct link between risk measurement and risk management - good risk management will keep losses at bay and thus result in lower capital requirements.", "To sum up: Basel III will change capital requirements, making crises less likely and thus supporting the euro area economy.", "So we think that the benefits of a faithful, consistent and timely implementation of Basel III will outweigh the costs.", "And we also think that banks will be able to manage its full impact.", "I know that some would like to reopen the Basel package before implementing it.", "In my view, this would not serve anyone's needs;
