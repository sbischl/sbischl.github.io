{"sentences": ["I am pleased to join you this morning for the 3rd Manila Times Business Forum.", "There are quite a number of fora that tackle economic outlook and issues of the day, but I don't know of any that is organized by a private institution, which dates itself to the time the country became independent from Spain!1 In addition, The Manila Times President & CEO Mr. Dante Ang said earlier that this forum gathers various speakers, including those officials from institutions such as IMF, WB and BSP to present their prognosis for the economy this year.", "Very few institutions stand the test of time - technology, innovation, and more recently, social media, among others; change the way we do things, how we perceive events, and therefore how we react.", "Central banking in the

interest rate and on-site supervision.", "But, I am getting ahead of myself here.", "I've been asked to speak on the Philippine economic outlook for 2016.", "While that seems much focused, our

year 2015, the overall balance of payments (BOP) position yielded a surplus of US$2.6 billion, a reversal from the US$2.9 billion deficit in 2014.", "Last Friday, we released the balance of payments position for January 2016.", "It was a deficit of $0.81 billion, which was due to the payment of National Government (NG) debt service and the BSP's foreign exchange (FX) operations that were only

the Philippines entered 2016 from a position of relative strength.", "My second headline: The Philippines is SEEN to SUSTAIN resilience in 2016.", "Resilience is a word that many use, but it is

strong net capital outflows in 2015.", "It forecasts that further net outflows from China are expected to continue in 2016.", "These net movements of funds from EMEs in 2015 have been reflected, among others, in a decline in ASEAN stock market values and an increase in the volatility of currencies in the region.", "How could these developments impact the Philippines?", "I already spoke earlier about the positive impact of low oil prices on the Philippines - which it helps reduce inflationary pressures while encouraging domestic consumption.", "We could, however, be adversely affected if the low oil prices cause export destinations of our OFWs in the Middle East to cut back on employment.", "As for the divergent growth prospects in the US and China, we could be affected via the trade channel.", "If US growth will continue and gain further traction, this could mitigate the impact of a slowdown in China.", "Furthermore, our domestic financial markets have not been spared from the

these factors will play out may not necessarily be the same in 2016.", "To paraphrase the title of the book of Reinhart and Rogoff, \"This time it COULD BE different.\"", "You may ask - How can we claim (as a second headline) that - \"the Philippines will sustain its resilience in 2016?\"", "First, because we have come into 2016 from a position of relative strength.", "This was my first headline.", "Second, from the point of view of the BSP, we have been focused in our policy thrusts.", "We are forward-looking in our policy formulation.", "Let me illustrate using our monetary policy.", "In 2014, we moved pre-emptively, in anticipation of the Fed lift off.", "Markets had been talking about \"lift off\" since the Fed \"taper tantrum\" in May 2013.", "But because until 2014, the Fed had only moved to end QE and not actually raise rates, markets kept on \"pushing the envelope,\" so to speak, in terms of maximizing the benefits of low interest rates.", "Through a series of tightening measures, we communicated to the market then that players should begin to take stock of how they were assessing and pricing risk.", "In a way, the BSP was reminding banks (and the general

with the inflation outlook at the time.", "Because our actions were early enough, our markets were well-positioned when the Fed finally raised its target rate in December 2015.", "We are not only forward-looking; we are also calibrated in our actions and mindful of the idiosyncrasies of our domestic economy.", "Let me illustrate using our approach to banking reform.", "In the aftermath of the GFC, the global financial market reform agenda was thick and heavy-handed, primarily because there was much fear of a recurrence of crisis from slack regulation.", "The Philippine banking system was not as affected by the GFC.", "In part, because our bankers are inherently conservative.", "Therefore the BSP adopted the global reforms in a calibrated manner and only as appropriate to our domestic conditions.", "We were an early adopter of the capital requirements under Basel 3, and we are now phasing in the rest of the components of Basel 3.", "In addition to adopting global reforms that are suited to our particular requirements in a timely manner, we also put out regulations and guidelines that are intended to raise bank governance standards, strengthen credit, operational, IT risk management and internal control frameworks, and improve market conduct.", "Our approach to regulatory reform is anchored on Financial Stability.", "This is an important lesson we learned from the GFC.", "Most policy makers have now come to realize that having strong individual banks, while that is necessary, is NOT sufficient.", "Policy makers need to consider the strength and soundness of the system as a whole.", "Our regulations benefit from consultation with the banking industry and are evidence-based.", "We meet with industry associations and groups - 15 in all - through the BSP Supervisory Policy Committee.", "Putting all these together, you can see that our approach to regulatory reform and adoption is comprehensive and strategic.", "Our goal is not only to grow strong domestic banks but also banks that can compete in the global arena, particularly when ASEAN integration comes to full swing.", "BSP policy formulation is forward-looking.", "It is calibrated and consultative.", "It is also based on solid academic foundations and strong market surveillance.", "In policy formulation, the BSP uses various econometric and macro- models.", "To help ensure that these tools are current against the latest economic research, we constantly fine tune our forecasting models, stress-tests parameters; recalibrate early-warning systems and distress indices.", "You may have also heard about our implementation of the interest rate corridor (IRC) in Q2 2016.", "As we've emphasized in our public briefings, the implementation of the IRC is an operational change.", "It is not a shift in our monetary policy framework.", "We will continue to be an inflation targeting central bank.", "The objective of the operational shift is to allow BSP to better steer short-term market interest rates towards the BSP policy rate.", "This should make the transmission of changes in the monetary policy stance to the rest of the economy more effective.", "Ladies and gentlemen, while we are improving how we do things, there will be no change in our primary mandate - we will keep our eye on inflation.", "At our most recent policy meeting, we kept policy rates steady (at 4 percent for the reverse repurchase rate).", "Our view was that domestic demand continues to be quite robust and there is no urgent need to provide further monetary stimulus.", "Going forward, we will continue to closely monitor the inflation process.", "We will also keep our FX policy of allowing the exchange rate to be determined by market forces.", "We are mindful that the peso is sensitive to external developments, so we will have scope for official action to limit excesses in exchange rate movements.", "Ladies and gentlemen, let me reiterate, we have the policy space to respond to uncertainties in the external and domestic environment.", "We will therefore make adjustments to the stance of policy as conditions warrant.", "Headline number 3: A stable macroeconomy should be inclusive.", "Some of you in the audience may be wondering why the Central Bank Governor would speak about inclusiveness.", "With the many macroeconomic and banking concerns it already has, should the central bank still be involved in inclusion.", "Our response in the BSP is YES, we should.", "We cannot ignore the financial consumer.", "When all is said and done, the purpose of a stable macroeconomic environment is ultimately to improve the consumer's well-being.", "In the BSP, we have institutionalized financial inclusion in our strategic agenda.", "We put in place banking regulations that leverage on technology to increase access to financial products for the underserved and unbanked, strengthen financial consumer protection, and raise financial education and awareness to these new financial products and modes of delivery.", "We will also pursue the development of our National Retail Payments System or NRPS.", "The NRPS should move the country from being cash-heavy to being \"cash-lite\".", "The NRPS is expected to improve transparency, security, and efficiency and reduce costs in financial transactions.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I presented three headlines.", "First, the Philippines bucked the trend in 2015.", "Next, we will continue to be resilient in 2016.", "And, finally we will endeavor to share the fruits of a strong macroeconomy to a broader cross-section of the economy.", "These three should be sufficient to make a full page of news.", "Indeed, our country has continued to expand despite the difficult external and domestic operating environment.", "It has been said that difficulty or adversity BUILDS character.", "In a way, we can say that the challenges our country has faced so far, and continue to face, have helped BUILD our character.", "We have also built buffers in the interim.", "And have become stronger as a nation.", "But, I also believe difficulties or adversities REVEAL character.", "The challenges and difficulties we have faced have revealed that we, as a nation, have what it takes to be resilient.", "However, ladies and gentlemen, these sources of resilience and buffers, the gains that we have attained so far, all these can only be fully harnessed if YOU in the private sector will continue to do your part as well.", "YOU turn the wheels of industry and business.", "YOUR actions will help solidify these gains.", "I hope to see YOU make headlines of your own.", "Headlines that will help ensure the Philippines sustains resilience in 2016 and beyond."], "classifications": ["none", "none",
