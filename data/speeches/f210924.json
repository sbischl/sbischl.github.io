still adding stimulus-but at a slower rate.", "When we get to the reinvestment phase, we will adjust the level of our bond purchases to maintain the Bank's total holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly stable.", "And when we arrive at the reinvestment phase, we will communicate this monetary policy decision clearly.", "Last March, my colleague, Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle, outlined a few important things about the transition to the reinvestment phase.", "First, the process will be gradual and will proceed in measured steps.", "Second, the timing of changes to the pace of purchases will be guided by our evolving assessment of the outlook as well as the strength and durability of the recovery.", "Third, adjusting the pace of bond purchases won't necessarily mean that we have changed our views about when we need to start raising the policy interest rate.", "We have tied interest rate decisions to our forward commitment to not raise the policy rate until slack is absorbed so that we sustainably achieve our inflation target.", "Eventually, when we need to reduce the amount of monetary stimulus, you can expect us to begin by raising our policy interest rate.", "What this all means is it is reasonable to expect that when we reach the reinvestment phase, we will remain there for a period of time, at least until we raise the policy interest rate.", "But again, let me emphasize, when we get to the reinvestment phase and how long we are in it are monetary policy decisions that will depend on the strength of the recovery and the evolution of inflation.", "Let me now say a few words about how we intend to operationalize this reinvestment phase when we get there.", "To understand that, let's back up a minute and recap how our balance sheet works.", "In normal times, the amount of bonds we purchase is driven by our liabilities, not monetary policy considerations.", "Before QE, our largest liability was the amount of bank notes in circulation.", "When households and businesses demand more bank notes for their everyday activities, we accommodate this demand, increasing the size of the bank note liability on our balance sheet.", "To match this liability, we need to hold a corresponding amount of financial assets, and we do this mainly by purchasing Government of Canada securities at auctions in the primary market.", "At the onset of COVID 19, the demand for bank notes grew more quickly than usual as Canadians withdrew extra cash as a precautionary measure.", "This greater demand for currency has increased the size of our balance sheet.", "But by far the largest driver of the increase in our balance sheet was the set of extraordinary liquidity and asset purchase programs we launched when the pandemic hit.", "Our initial goal was to restore market liquidity and keep credit flowing in the economy.", "Once market functioning normalized, we gradually wound down these programs, and many of the assets have since matured and rolled off our balance sheet.", "The one exception is our Government Bond Purchase Program, or GBPP.", "Through the GBPP, we bought large amounts of bonds that the government had issued and sold to the private sector.", "Initially, the GBPP was aimed at restoring market functioning.", "But as Canada emerged from the first lockdown in summer 2020, we began using this program to provide additional monetary stimulus to support the economic recovery.", "This is our QE program.", "Our QE program is implemented by buying Government of Canada bonds held by the private sector in the secondary market in a competitive reverse auction process.", "As I indicated above, at the height of the COVID 19 shock, we were buying at least $5 billion a week.", "And as the economy has recovered, we have gradually reduced our purchases to a target of $2 billion a week.", "When we get to the reinvestment phase, we will want to maintain our total stock of government bonds at a relatively stable level.", "This will maintain the monetary stimulus we are providing through our balance sheet but not increase it further.", "To do this, we will reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds.", "In general, our purchases during this period will not match the maturities rolling off one-for-one because the maturities are large and unevenly spaced.", "We will therefore adjust our purchases to match maturities over a longer period, so our purchases are not unduly volatile.", "We report our balance sheet monthly.", "Based on the maturity structure of our total holdings of Government of Canada bonds, reinvesting maturing bonds will require purchases ranging around $1 billion a week on average.", "Given the uneven distribution of our maturities, we will operationalize a target range for purchases of between $4 billion and $5 billion a month.", "This will encompass both our primary and secondary market purchases.", "Much of the focus has understandably been on our large-scale secondary market bond purchases associated with QE.", "But during the reinvestment phase, we will reduce both our primary market purchases at Government of Canada bond auctions and our purchases in the secondary market.", "This will keep our total holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly stable over time.", "Our path toward the reinvestment phase has been gradual, and we will continue to proceed in measured steps guided by our evolving assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and the strength and durability of the recovery.", "Eventually, the reinvestment phase will end, and we will stop purchasing bonds to replace the ones that are maturing, so our holdings of Government of Canada bonds will decline.", "But as I mentioned above, it is reasonable to expect that when we do eventually need to reduce monetary stimulus, our first move will be to raise the target for the overnight rate-our policy interest rate.", "The economic recuperation from the pandemic continues to be bumpy and uneven.", "Progress with vaccinations has allowed many of us to enjoy a return to more normal activities.", "This is supporting job gains and economic growth, particularly in the sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.", "And we continue to expect strong growth through the second half of this year.", "But the virus and pandemic-related disruptions have not gone away, and they will continue to disturb our lives and weigh on economic activity.", "At the Bank of Canada, we are focused on delivering the best monetary policy for the recovery.", "Our commitment is to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve our 2 percent inflation target.", "And you can count on us to continue to be transparent with our analysis and deliberate in our communications.", "I would like to thank Grahame Johnson and Ste\u0301phane Lavoie for their help in preparing this speech.", "See E. Ens, L. Savoie-Chabot, K. G. See and S. L. Wee, \"Assessing Labour Market Slack for Monetary Policy,\" Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper (forthcoming).", "Government of Canada bonds can be acquired at primary market auctions or through the secondary market after initial issuances.", "Secondary market purchases are typically done for policy purposes, including QE."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Economic recovery", "Monetary policy", "QE", "Inflation", "Labour market", "Supply chain", "Reinvestment", "Interest rates", "Bank of Canada", "COVID-19"]}
