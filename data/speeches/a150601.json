of the achievements of NPCI which have significantly altered the retail payments landscape in the country are as under: \u2022 The National Financial Switch (NFS), a vast network of ATMs, has enhanced

simply replicate the model in our jurisdictions?", "The answer, I am afraid, is a big NO.", "Let me say why with the example of India.", "India is diverse - in the sense of social customs, culture, religious beliefs.", "The diversity and multitude of population and geographic spread of the country- are some factors which make our task extremely complex.", "The ease with which people can handle technology also differs across people of different age groups, income levels, literacy levels etc.", "Hence, it is difficult to design product which can work seamlessly across all sections of the society.", "Thus, while it is true that no scheme or model can work seamlessly across all economies; what might indeed be best is learn from the other successful delivery models and customise the product and service offerings to suit the DNA of the respective economy and society.", "Technology and the payment systems 13.", "Growing mobile and internet penetration has opened new avenues for the payment systems services.", "This is reflected in the way the new age customer transacts her business.", "To quote Brett King, the author of 'Bank 3.0': \"Customers don't use channel or products in

an utility bill , use their credit card to purchase some goods from a retailer , fill out a personal loan application online, ring up the call centre to see what their credit card balance is or report

online\".", "The above statement denotes the diverse set of banking applications which technology can support.", "In fact, there is a need of a single channel solution to multiple product offerings.",

often, these channels are supported by different vendors and also one use different technology which increases complexity and involves cost.", "Technology is ever evolving and adoption of new technology for staying contemporaneous is a costly proposition.", "It is pertinent, therefore, that all the capabilities of the technology enabled delivery solutions are optimally exploited, so that we are not saddled with unproductive investments.", "While there is a lot of euphoria around the adoption of mobile banking and mobile payments, the model has been relatively less successful barring a few countries where the right environmental factors existed.", "I am talking here about the delivery of financial and payment services by using the mobile device rather than its use as an access channel for internet banking etc.", "In the Indian context, an objective analysis would reveal various reasons for slow adoption.", "There are technical issues like type of handsets, variety of operating systems, encryption requirements, inter-operable platforms or the lack of it, absence of standardised communication structures, difficulty in downloading application, time lag in activation etc.", "These get accentuated by the operational difficulties in on-boarding merchants and customers and customer ownership issues.", "The interplay of these factors has stymied the deployment and adoption of mobile banking as an effective and widely accepted delivery channel.", "Issues of coordination and cooperation between banks and telcos, is another aspect which acts as either a driver or a barrier to the adoption of mobile banking.", "These issues need to be quickly resolved if the mobile payments have succeed in our country.", "Emerging scenario 16.", "It would be interesting here to visualize few scenarios which may emerge in future: \u2022 Simultaneous impact of playing out of Reed's law and Moore's law where both \"the payment space\" and \"the pinpoints\" within the space would grow exponentially.", "\u2022 Whether some of the technology companies and retail banks can undergo transformation to such an extent that the technology firm would appear more like a retail bank

notes and coins.", "\u2022 Salaries and payments distributed directly on the mobile wallet akin to currency distribution.", "\u2022 With the reduction in cash transaction, ATMs might have to offer other services rather than only dispensing cash in order to remain relevant.", "\u2022 Ease of credit through KYC, Mass Market Credit Rating at the click of a button.", "\u2022 Whether cross-border transactions can also happen on mobiles in future?", "The payment system players would have to gear up to accommodate and leverage upon such possibilities going ahead.", "Regulatory challenges 17.", "The innovations in the payment system space and introduction of new products are already posing challenges for the regulators and these challenges are likely to intensify going forward.", "Some of the possible dilemmas/challenges that the regulators would be faced with \u2022 Whether payment and settlement would remain banks' preserve?", "If not, what would be regulatory stance?", "\u2022 What would be the way forward in regulating virtual currencies?", "\u2022 Cloud computing and Cyber Security \u2022 Striking the right balance between ease of doing business and ensuring security Challenges from mobile transactions becoming more user centric than transaction \u2022 Monitoring of cross-currency / cross-border mobile transactions, not if but when they happen.", "The most important challenge for the regulator would be to do a tight rope walk between providing the \"Right Guidance but not at the cost of stifling innovation\".", "Let me conclude by once again congratulating NPCI for organising this international Conference.", "The institution has so far overcome difficult challenges and made significant achievements in different spheres of retail payment arena.", "However, it is just the beginning.", "It would need to be nimble-footed and innovate continuously to meet the challenges emanating from a dynamic world.", "As I said before, such conferences
