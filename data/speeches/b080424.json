it could come from the extensive use of domestic savings to finance offshore lending; it could come from the use of capital inflows to finance domestic lending.", "The point is that once you have an IFC operating in both the domestic economy and offshore, there could be negative consequences from a sudden reversal of capital; obviously regulation would need to mitigate these risks.", "Second, in a small country like ours, there is always the risk that the IFC increases draining the domestic competition for the scarce technical and managerial resources, financial center; we do not yet have an IFC and already there is aggressive competition for talent in the financial sector.", "So that's something that we should be mindful of - the need for accelerated training.", "One potential cost of an IFC that is often cited is this;
