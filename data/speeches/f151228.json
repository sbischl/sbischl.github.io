with regulation of the Non-Banking Financial Institutions was added to the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934.", "It recognised that non-banking financial activity is an integral part of the financial

financial sector is one where the externalities are such that it warrants close regulation and supervision in the interests of systemic stability, safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions and to protect the consumers.", "The objective of NBFC regulations during the twentieth century was predominantly to protect the interests of the depositors.", "However, as the NBFCs grew in size and their interconnectedness with the banking system became visible and raised concerns about their capacity to disturb systemic stability, the NBFCs were brought under prudential regulatory framework from 2006 onwards.", "While the overall approach followed the contours as described above, the Reserve Bank, as the regulator of NBFCs has kept the sector's potential to contribute to the development of identified segments of the economy and accordingly has been following a developmental bias in its regulatory framework relating to the NBFCs.", "The NBFCs focus on niche areas of business addressing specific needs of customers.", "Therefore, the Reserve Bank has classified varieties of specific types of NBFCs separately and regulates each such type differently.", "As on date such types include asset financing, core investment, loan, investment, micro-financing, factoring, infrastructure financing, mortgage guarantee, etc.", "Further, the housing finance, insurance and collective investment activities, though statutorily defined as NBFI activities, their regulations have been left in the hands of other sectoral regulators like the National Housing Bank (NHB), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).", "This approach reflected the position that non-bank financial system may contribute to financial deepening in these identified segments.", "The NBFCs can be advantageous due to their ability to lower transaction costs, quick decision making capabilities, customer orientation and prompt provision of services.", "In terms of products and services offered, the NBFCs complement the banks.", "Nevertheless, the business model of NBFCs is inherently risk-prone.", "Weaker underwriting standards, enhanced risk taking capabilities and increased complexity of their activities cause concerns.", "Besides riskiness pertaining to business model, NBFCs are exposed to key risks emanating from regulatory gaps, arbitrage and contagion effect.", "NBFCs are more prone to systemic risks on account of concentration of exposure to specific sectors.", "Also, since these entities are more dependent on bank funding, both directly and indirectly, the interconnectedness risk tends to be higher.", "Their asset-liability mismatches accentuate liquidity risks.", "All told, these risks can quickly escalate as solvency risks and lead to systemic risk as well.", "Therefore, careful and continuous monitoring is still required to

regulations 12.", "Changes to the regulations concerning NBFC sector over the last decade and a half had largely been incremental.", "However, in November 2014, a detailed review of the entire regulatory framework for the NBFC sector was undertaken with a view to transitioning, over time, to an activity based regulation of NBFCs as opposed to the current approach of entitybased regulation.", "The Bank has been mindful of the fact that the revisions should not impede the dynamism displayed by NBFCs in delivering innovation and last mile connectivity for meeting the credit needs of the productive sectors of the economy.", "The broad principles followed in framing the revised guidelines was to review the regulations from the perspective of the mandate of the Reserve Bank, viz., financial stability, depositor protection and customer protection.", "Hence, a) the focus has been on addressing risks where they exist, b) address gaps in regulation, c) reduce complexities and make regulations simple and easy to follow, d) harmonise regulations within the sector and with that of banks to a limited extent, e) acknowledge that there may be pockets within the sector that do not require to be stringently regulated and f) give adequate time to the NBFCs to adjust to the revised regulatory framework so that there are no disruptions in business.", "Consequently, the revised regulatory framework for NBFCs was introduced and the threshold for systemic significance has been revised to total asset size of \u20b9 500 crore.", "Now, there are two broad categories of NBFCs requiring closer attention of regulators and supervisors.", "These are a) non - deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than \u20b9 500 crore (NBFCs-ND) and b) non - deposit accepting NBFCs with assets of \u20b9 500 crore and above (NBFCs-ND-SI) and deposit accepting NBFCs (NBFCs-D).", "Reporting and regulatory provisions are accordingly applied to have better focus on systemically important entities and efficient allocation of supervisory resources.", "Minimal prudential regulations have been prescribed for non-deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than \u20b9 500 crore.", "For these non-deposit accepting companies (NBFCs-ND) below the threshold of systemic significance, prudential regulations, other than capital adequacy and credit concentration norms, are applicable only where public funds are accepted and conduct of business regulations (FPC, KYC) where there is customer interface.", "A simple leverage ratio of 7 has been put in place so that their asset growth is in sync with the capital they hold.", "Further, reporting by such NBFCs will be through a simplified annual return.", "However, registration under Section 45 IA of the RBI Act is mandatory and they are subjected to a simplified reporting system along with minimum net owned funds (NOF) of \u20b9 2 crore.", "For those non-deposit accepting companies (NBFCs-ND-SI) above the threshold of systemic significance and for all NBFC-D, prudential regulations are applicable and conduct of business regulations wherever customer interface exists.", "In line with international best practices, core capital requirement has been strengthened (existing 7.5%; raised to 10% to be phased over 2 years).", "Asset classification norms have been aligned with that of banks (from the current 180 day and 360 day norm for loan and HP / Leased assets respectively to a 90 day norm phased in over 3 years).", "Higher standard asset provisioning has been put in place (0.4% against the existing 0.25% phased in over 3 years).", "Further, credit concentration norms have been harmonised between the various categories of NBFCs by removing the dispensation given to AFCs to exceed the defined norms by 5%.", "(Dispensation given to IFCs and IDFs has been retained as infra loans are high value loans) and corporate governance standards, viz., fit and proper criteria for directors, disclosure and transparency have been strengthened so that they are professionally managed and develop a sound compliance culture.", "In order to harmonise the deposit acceptance regulations across all deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D) and move over to a regimen of only credit rated NBFCs-D accessing public deposits, existing unrated Asset Finance Companies (AFCs), which were permitted to accept deposits, shall have to get themselves rated by March 31, 2016.", "Further, the limit for acceptance of deposits has been reduced for rated AFCs from 4 times earlier to 1.5 times of NOF.", "The Principal Business Criteria (PBC) for NBFC-Factors has been revised to 50:50 from the existing 75:75, thereby aligning it with the provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011.", "Consequently, an NBFC whose factoring assets and factoring income are 50 percent of the total assets and total income respectively are now classified as NBFC-Factors.", "This is expected to provide a boost to factoring activities in the country.", "In the case of NBFC- MFIs , based on recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor), the limit on the total indebtedness of a borrower was raised to \u20b9 1,00,000/- from \u20b9 50,000/-.", "Income criteria of borrowers for loans to be included as qualifying assets of these NBFCs was changed: for borrowers with a rural household annual income not exceeding \u20b9 1,00,000/- against \u20b9 60,000/- earlier and urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding \u20b9 1,60,000/- against \u20b9 1,20,000/- earlier; ceiling on the amount of loan that can be disbursed was revised to \u20b9 60,000/- from \u20b9 35,000/- earlier in

microfinance companies and loan companies contributed to sturdy growth in the loan portfolio of NBFCs-ND-SI.", "Among the sectors, infrastructure, medium and largescale industries, and the transport sectors contributed to strong growth in credit off-take of the NBFCs-ND-SI.", "During 2014-15, NBFCs-ND-SI raised funds mainly through debentures and commercial papers.", "Borrowings from banks, which earlier constituted to be the main source of funding, has been progressively reduced.", "A notable feature is the rising exposure of mutual funds to the financial instruments floated mainly by the

overall deterioration spreading across the financial system as the economy slowed.", "Gross NPAs as per cent of credit deployed rose to 4.1 per cent by end-March 2015.", "In my opinion, the prospects for the sector in the medium term are not going to be uniform.", "Different segments of the sector are poised for different prospects and challenges.", "For example, the NBFC-MFI segment is going to shrink heavily as the big ten of them convert themselves into Small Finance Banks in the next one year or so.", "I will hasten to add that this can yet bring higher impetus for the other NBFC-MFIs to grow, not just because of the availability of space vacated by the big ten, but also because the capital that will be released when many of the converting NBFC-MFIs pay off the current investors as a part of capital restructuring, and because of renewed interests by such venture capital aiming growth prospects in such conversions in the future.", "The infrastructure NBFCs will have greater scope in the coming years, both because the economic growth will bring forth new projects and banks, having learnt lessons in the recent past, will have a restrained approach towards such projects.", "If the Infra-NBFCs will have their structuring these projects in a careful way, they will have good prospects.", "As the large exposure regime for the banks will apply by 2018, NBFCs will have space for market funding or loan funding of big corporate financing in the medium term.", "Loan companies will face enhanced consumer protection measures.", "They will be required to appropriately educate their

and moving towards activity based regulation.", "The regulatory framework, put in place in November 2014, is a first step in this direction.", "Going forward, we will work towards greater harmonisation of the regulations with a view to reducing the number of NBFC categories.", "However, the Reserve Bank is alive to the developmental needs of the economy and therefore will continue to
