b. Zambian banks generally have high operating costs and interest rate spreads; and c. the physical coverage of financial outlets may not increase at current cost levels.", "It is therefore, my hope that this Forum will address these and other challenges that slow the pace of financial inclusion in our countries.", "Honourable Minister, over the past two years, we have noted with delight that financial institutions in Zambia are beginning to rise up to the challenge by beginning to broaden the scope of their financial services and extending their services beyond the traditional customers to include previously unbanked communities.", "In addition, the Zambian financial sector has in recent years experienced growth in numbers of both registered commercial banks and non - bank financial institutions.", "We in Zambia, therefore, see this Forum as being timely and providing a unique opportunity for African financial institutions to share knowledge and experiences on how best to promote financial inclusiveness, particularly among our rural and peri-urban communities who have since not been fully integrated in the financial systems of most of our countries.", "This entails that they are not effectively participating in the economic growth that is being experienced in these countries.", "This Forum also comes at a time that we in Zambia have just lost a statesman who was passionate about rural development and empowerment of all citizens.", "The conference theme therefore, is appropriate for us as we carry on the vision of our beloved late President, Dr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, SC (M.H.S.R.I.P).", "In this respect, we would also like to acknowledge the many expressions of sympathy extended to us during our time of mourning.", "Distinguished delegates, on behalf of AFRACA, I would like to thank our various presenters and panelists for accepting to facilitate our deliberations over the next two days.", "I would therefore, like to implore all delegates to engage fully in these discussions and make the most of the wealth of knowledge and experience represented in the house.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure and privilege once again to welcome you to the second AFRACA Central Banks' Forum.", "I now wish to invite our distinguished Guest of Honour, the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Honourable Ng'andu P.
