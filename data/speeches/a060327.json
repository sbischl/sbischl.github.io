perspective.", "First, Norway is a small, mountainous country with a population of only 41\u20442 million people scattered across a land area that is one tenth of the size of India.", "Second, Norway's economic growth has been favourable for many years, and the per capita income is among the highest in the world.", "An abundance of natural resources, not least oil and gas, and openness to

that of other European countries.", "This change in industry structure is necessary and lies at the heart of economic development.", "The second half of the 19th century also represents a golden age

infrastructure and private and public industrial companies was an important part of economic policy after the war.", "The fixed investment-toGDP ratio stayed at a historically high level until the late 1970s.", "On the other hand, low or negative real interest rates, combined with credit regulation, contributed to a low return to capital and an inefficient use of resources.", "Since the late

gained and the lessons learned in these two decades.", "The economic policy contributed to wide fluctuations in the Norwegian economy.", "Inflation became high and variable.", "This was largely due to a perception in the 1960s and 1970s that strong growth and low unemployment could be achieved if we were only willing to accept somewhat higher inflation.", "But it was gradually recognised that there was no such trade-off.", "The absence of a nominal anchor was one of the main reasons behind the pronounced swings in the Norwegian economy.", "With a policy of low interest rates and devaluations, inflation took root.", "Nominal interest rates were kept at a low level even though inflation rose.", "Frequent devaluations from 1976 were unable in the long term to prevent a decline in the manufacturing sector.", "On the contrary, they proved to be self-reinforcing.", "The wide fluctuations culminated in a credit boom in the mid-1980s.", "The fluctuations were reinforced by oil price shocks and the use of expected revenues from oil production.", "The government began already in the 1970s to budget on the basis of future strong growth in petroleum revenues.", "The result was that

lost export market shares in the late 1980s in spite of the booming conditions abroad and substantial capacity slack at home.", "It was recognised that a substantial revision of economic policy would be necessary and that the problems created by inflation had to be taken seriously.", "The exchange rate was chosen as the nominal anchor in 1986.", "A fixed exchange rate was an intermediate target for achieving low and stable inflation.", "We had to abandon the fixed exchange rate policy in 1992.", "An important reason was the weakness inherent in the fixed exchange rate regime in a world with free capital flows and deep financial markets.", "The krone exchange rate showed, however, little change to begin with and rapidly found a new range.", "A formal inflation target for monetary policy was introduced in the spring of 2001.", "The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the government is inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time.", "Many countries had already gained many years' experience in operating such a system.", "New Zealand was the first in line towards the end of the 1980s.", "Developments over the past 40 years illustrate that the most important contribution monetary policy can make to sound economic developments in the long term is low and stable inflation.", "This provides the economy with a nominal anchor.", "Low and stable inflation makes it easier for economic agents to distinguish changes in relative prices from changes in the general price level.", "Prices become a more accurate information vehicle.", "Through the 1990s, inflation generally remained in the interval 11\u20442 - 31\u20442 per cent.", "When there is confidence in the inflation target, monetary policy can also contribute to stabilising output and employment.", "Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that weight is given to both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment in interest-rate setting.", "In order to make forecasts for inflation and output, we must also judge how interest rates will develop in the future.", "If inflation deviates substantially from the target for a period, the interest rate will be set with a view to returning it gradually to the target, so that we avoid substantial variations in output and employment.", "This chart illustrates the judgement as published in the latest Report.", "Past experience indicates that expectations as to future inflation remain stable even if inflation varies somewhat as long as the interest rate is used actively to curb the effects.", "Monetary policy cannot finetune economic developments, but it can prevent the largest effects from occurring when the economy is exposed to disturbances.", "In some situations, it may be appropriate to take into account particularly unfavourable developments.", "In a period of increased cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, changes in competitive conditions and new trading patterns, Norway may, with our very open economy, have to accept somewhat greater variation in inflation and deviations from the target, as we have witnessed over the past two to three years.", "Challenges in an oil economy Petroleum revenues pose as mentioned special challenges to stabilisation policy.", "The experience of other countries that had received large, unexpected income from natural resources was not encouraging.", "The classic example is Spain's substantial revenues from the colonisation of America in the 1600s.", "The historian David Landes1 summarised the Spanish experience as follows: Landes stated that easy money is bad for a country.", "It is very tempting to live comfortably on this income and be less concerned about safeguarding other revenue sources.", "In that case, the country is poorly poised to cope with an end to easy money.", "The oil age in Norway has spanned 30 years and it appears that it will continue for many years ahead.", "Petroleum activities give Norway an economic base that is not available to many other countries.", "But it also presents us with many challenges.", "First, petroleum wealth is part of Norway's national wealth.", "It is misleading to look upon the cash flow from petroleum activities as income.", "The appropriate economic perspective is to see the transfer of the cash flow to the Government Pension Fund as a way of transferring capital from one account to another - from petroleum to foreign securities.", "By doing so, we diversify risk.", "We must also strive for an equitable distribution of this wealth across generations.", "The Norwegian authorities have been successful in ensuring that the bulk of petroleum wealth benefits society as a whole.", "Both the state's ownership interests through the State's Direct Financial Interest in petroleum activities (SDFI) and the tax system have contributed.", "The companies that extract oil earn a reasonable return on their investments and have incentives to invest, but the economic rent has essentially accrued to the general public.", "Second, the size of the cash flow from petroleum activities also varies.", "If petroleum revenues were to be used as they accrue, this would lead to wide fluctuations in demand in the Norwegian economy.", "Third, the use of petroleum revenues has an impact on competitiveness in Norwegian business and industry.", "A high level and substantial variations in the use of petroleum revenues would have a negative impact on internationally exposed industries.", "The establishment of the Government Pension Fund and the spending guidelines for petroleum revenues are intended to meet these challenges.", "The government earns large net cash flows deriving from the oil companies' sale of petroleum products in foreign markets.", "The Pension Fund serves as a buffer between current petroleum revenues and spending these revenues in the Norwegian economy.", "All central government revenues from petroleum operations shall be transferred to the Fund.", "According to the fiscal rule that has been approved by the Norwegian parliament, petroleum revenue spending shall be limited to 4 per cent or the expected annual real return on the Pension Fund over time.", "This partly insulates the economy from fluctuations in oil prices and extraction rates in the petroleum sector - and when followed it ensures that revenue spending in the Norwegian economy is at a level that can be sustained over time.", "The difference between the net cash flow and spending is reinvested in foreign financial markets.", "The Petroleum Fund also functions as a buffer and dampens the wide fluctuations in the krone exchange rate that petroleum revenues might otherwise have generated.", "Operators in the foreign exchange market may at times have a tendency to underestimate the Fund's function as a stabilisation mechanism.", "The capital outflows through the Fund contribute to both curbing the appreciation of the krone and maintaining its stability.", "At the end of 2005, the market value of the Pension Fund's portfolio was roughly 73 per cent of GDP.", "As shown in the chart, the value of the Fund is rising rapidly and may continue to do so in the years ahead.", "The Fund is now approaching the nominal value of one year's GDP and may reach two in the course of the next decade.", "On the other hand, Norway, like many other countries, is facing substantial fiscal challenges.", "Financing the large pension payments that will have to be disbursed in the coming years will be very demanding.", "To sum up, Norway has a market economy and a large government sector.", "The way in which economic policy is oriented today reflects the knowledge gained and the lessons learned.", "We know from experience that fiscal policy alone cannot ensure a high level of employment.", "The structure of the labour market and wage formation are probably of greater importance.", "The direct regulation of credit, interest rates and capital movements collapsed and was phased out in the 1980s.", "Price regulation no longer plays a role as a macroeconomic instrument.", "The scope of business policy has become more general.", "The most important contribution monetary policy can make to sound economic developments in the long term is low and stable inflation.", "Low and stable inflation has contributed to solid growth in the global economy in recent years.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
