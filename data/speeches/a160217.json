local communities.", "Even the medium and large industries and in transport an increasing range of activities can be undertaken on cooperative lines\".", "The Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-1997) laid

Nehru, who had a strong faith in the cooperative movement, while opening an international seminar on cooperative leadership in South-East Asia, had said \"But my outlook at present is not the outlook of spreading the cooperative movement gradually, progressively, as it has done.", "My outlook is to convulse India with the Cooperative Movement or rather with cooperation to make it, broadly speaking, the basic activity of India, in every village as well as elsewhere; and finally, indeed, to make the cooperative approach the common thinking of India....Therefore, the whole future of India really depends on the success of this approach of ours to these vast numbers, hundreds of millions of people\".", "Why this kind of attention, belief and expectations on cooperation?", "Is it because, it is more than 100 years old?", "Or is it because of the innate features that go to define a cooperative?", "Or is it because of the socio-economic Utopia of tranquility, mutual understanding, bonding and support and thereby growth that it promises for its members?", "Some historical perspectives 29.", "Cooperatives came on the scene in India, in a big way, around the turn of 19th century into 20th century.", "In the first 50 years of its history, it is reported to have reached as high a number of more than two lakh cooperatives registered by mid 20th century.", "They had permeated

the voluntary creation of a new and valuable security.", "A strong association competent to offer guarantees and advantages of lending to groups instead of individuals were major advantages.", "The Commission also suggested the principles underlying agricultural banks and land banks.", "Based on the recommendations of the Edward Law Committee, the Cooperative Credit Societies Act was passed in 1904.", "As its name suggests, the Cooperative Credit Societies Act was restricted to credit cooperatives.", "It was only subsequently, a more comprehensive legislation called the Cooperative Societies Act was enacted.", "This Act, inter alia, provided for the creation of the post of registrar of cooperative societies and registration of cooperative societies for various purposes and their audit.", "\"The underlying idea of all Mutual Credit Associations, such as we recommend, is that a number of persons, by combining together, create a new and valuable security, which none of them previously possessed as individuals.", "Co-operation substitutes for isolated and helpless agricultural units a strong association competent to offer guarantees and capable of inspiring confidence.", "The advantages of lending to groups instead of to individuals need no demonstration.", "It is simpler for a creditor to deal with a group of fifty or a hundred associated cultivators than with the same number singly; it is simpler for him to obtain repayment from the group than from each of the members composing it; it is simpler for the group to make its own arrangements with each member than for the lender to try to do so\".", "What I just now read is from the Report of the Famine Commission 1901.", "Doesn't ring several bells?", "Our modern day Self Help Groups (SHG), Joint Liability
