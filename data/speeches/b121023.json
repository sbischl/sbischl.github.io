industry?", "Can we exhibit the level of preparedness the banking and financial industry displayed in Japan during the tsunami?", "In recent times, ATMs of a large bank were out of operation because the BCP/DR mechanism put in place for moving the primary site to the secondary site did not kick in.", "BCP/DR is still looked at as an IT issue in the organization where as it is actually a business issue.", "Successful BCP/DR mechanism involves three critical aspects of people, process and technology.", "Are we giving adequate emphasis on people aspects?", "Question 2: What is the status of adapting CBS to meet the future needs including the banking need of billion plus population?", "The coming days will put several demands on the CBS in banks.", "Indian financial sector is to become the third largest in the world in terms of asset size by 2025 and will warrant commensurate increase in depth and breadth of financial products and instruments as well as high level of service delivery.", "The initiatives towards inclusive banking would see customer base of banks expanding at a faster pace.", "The continued emphasis on shifting cash transactions to non-cash modes; and the efforts of the Government to transfer all social benefits electronically to the citizens, the volume of transactions in the electronic payment systems would grow manifold.", "Further, as the IDC Financial Insights, April 2012 has reported \"banks would like to see their core banking systems help them cope with the onslaught of new regulations and the new reporting requirements that come along with the new rules\".", "Besides, several initiatives listed in the \"Payment Systems in India: Vision 2012-15\" such as uniform routing code, uniform account code, electronic trade financing etc are going to affect the way the banks are processing transactions today and would require, if implemented, suitable adjustments by banks.", "Thus, these developments are likely to challenge the scalability and adaptability of CBS in banks not only in terms of transaction handling but also in terms of adding new products, new processes and new applications.", "Are the banks ready for such future demands?", "Question 3: Converting data archives to data warehouse - have we tapped the potential?", "The needs for use of business intelligence, analytical and data warehousing for retaining competitive advantages in a highly competitive industry were never so urgent for banks.", "Analytics has the power to transform technology and data from supporting tools into strategic weapons for retaining and servicing the existing and potential customers.", "CBS of bank is generating huge piles of data.", "But how many of the banks have really leveraged the data goldmine they have to the hilt?", "Have they sufficiently built skill sets to see pattern in those data bases and increased their understanding of customer behavior?", "Have the banks realized the potential of analytics and business intelligence in fraud management and regulatory compliance in areas of AML/CFT, suspicious transaction reporting etc?", "Question 4: What ails alternate banking channels from achieving a critical mass - customer fear, ignorance or bad business pursuits by many banks?", "It is well known that socio-cultural factors affect the customers' adoption of alternate business channels.", "But are the banks doing enough to instill the sense of security, reliability and trustworthiness of the alternate channels in customers to help them overcome these barriers?", "Adoption of alternate banking channels would require moving the customers from being \"assisted\" initially to becoming \"self-reliant\" in using the channels.", "Though, the banks may have strategies for increasing the usages of alternate channels, successful adoption would depend to a large extent on the line managers dealing with customers.", "Are they motivated enough to promote alternate channels?", "How do we incentivize the branches that initiate the customers to electronic banking?", "Question 5: Outsourcing or abdicating - are banks treading the thin line?", "It is but natural for banks to outsource their some of their activities especially their IT related activities.", "However outsourcing brings in its wake, several risks and thus it is imperative for any bank outsourcing its activities to ensure effective management of these risks.", "Do the banks have adequate controls over the outsourced activities and outsourcing entities?", "I heard of an incident where the administrative password of a critical application server of a bank was with the vendor not with the system administrator of the bank.", "Delegating is what we ask someone to do on our behalf; while abdicating is what we do as escapism, camouflaging lack of skill sets.", "One related question is over-dependence on certain IT systems (including operating systems and databases) resulting in concentration of risk in certain components / vendors which are spread across the banking sector.", "What could be done to redress this?", "Question 6: Are banks properly leveraging technology for inclusive banking?", "The challenge in financial inclusion is reducing the gap between demand and supply of financial services.", "Delivery of banking services is not always feasible in rural areas with cost effective distribution being a challenge.", "Can the technology help in meeting this distribution gap?", "Everybody is pinning hope of mobile technology for financial inclusion.", "Is it an exciting possibility or a meaningless dream?", "It is definitely an exciting possibility.", "The mobile banking in India is gradually making in-roads.", "However, the success of mobile banking would depend on how the banks and the mobile service providers co-operate and collaborate to deliver the financial services to the unbanked.", "Further, it would depend on banks how they can leverage the technology to improve business, whether it's through mobility, low-cost ATM rollouts, or revenue sharing models and service management.", "Question 7: Time for wake up call for banks?", "The World Payments Report 20126 puts India as the 13th largest non-cash payments market in the world, with non-cash volumes have been growing about 10% a year.", "However, the non-cash payments growth in India is behind the more enthusiastic pace of other BRIC nations (China and Russia having growth rate of 30 per cent).The \"Payment Systems in India: Vision 2012-15\" focuses on inculcating the habit of cash less payments in the citizens of the country for a less-cash society.", "The execution and achievement of the Vision would be purely driven by the banks and non-bank entities.", "The World Payment Report 2012 report recognizing the role of banks in non-cash payments states that banks need to innovate even more around customer needs to drive loyalty and retention.", "But are the banks in India doing enough?", "Are banks taking the easy way out by being content with the measures initiated by the regulator?", "To illustrate most of nearly 7 lakh PoS terminals in the country are deployed by three banks.", "Where most of the banks issue cards, except for a few banks, none of them are in acquiring business.", "Is this because card issuance is a lot easier than enrolling merchants and putting in place the PoS infrastructure?", "One way could be to review the extant guidelines on acquiring PoS/ ATM transactions in terms of increased role of non-bank payment system operators by permitting white label PoS.", "The other could be to mandate the banks to deploy PoS terminals linked/proportion to the number of cards issued by them.", "IT and communication technology has changed banking and financial sector in many fundamental ways.", "It has created new kinds of risk with far graver potential consequences than in the pre-techno-banking era but at the same time it has opened up new paths to make financial sector broad based and, particularly in the context of economies like ours, to explore innovative ways to achieve financial inclusion.", "In this pursuit there are several important issues that Indian banks will have to face up and resolve.", "Finally, exploitation of the benefits of the IT resources have to be within a comprehensive framework of governance that aligns the interests of all stakeholders, addresses the risks arising from technology-enabled business processes, and is in sync with the broader social objectives."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
