real sector?", "If the financial sector exists, as traditionally conceived to intermediate financial resources for optimal channelisation to productive sectors, then over the last few years the script

importance of containing systemic leverage has been underlined.", "While obviously there can't be market stops and starts for this purpose but the whole incentive structure built in the public policy framework needs to be aligned with the objective of disincentivising leverage beyond a point.", "Any future financial market reform measure and introduction of new innovations/products must be preceded by an assessment of the resultant leverage for the system in quantifiable terms.", "(iv) Financial sector entities need to be seen and regulated as risk repositories in the system - any notion of their risks being dissipated into or outside the system is inherently flawed.", "There is therefore need for limits, prudential safeguards and adequate capital to support the risks.", "It is also necessary to understand the substance of a product and not merely the nomenclature.", "Once this understanding is there the income recognition and accounting treatment becomes clear.", "Receipt of premia/fees for assuming a contingent liability will then not be treated as income but as funds for meeting potential future liabilities.", "(v) It is now recognised that the current microeconomic-driven prudential regulatory framework, including Basel II is procyclical which further worsens the impact of crises on institutions.", "In 2000, the Bank of Spain introduced a dynamic, rules-based loan-loss provisioning system in which provisions increase in periods of higher credit growth and economic expansion, and decrease in times of low or negative growth, thereby contributing to smooth income and capital over time.", "RBI also did something similar when we increased the risk weight as also the general provisioning requirement on exposures to sectors which showed high credit growth.", "This was reduced recently when growth moderated.", "(vi) The increasing focus on holistic approach towards regulation of financial entities is a welcome change from the view that allowed a growing proportion of products and participants to go unregulated on the grounds that they had no systematic impact.", "This approach resulted in the shadow banking system made up of unregulated SIVs and conduits distributing opaque structured products containing risky assets with the active marketing of rating agencies.", "In India also, one view used to be that only deposit taking NBFCs need regulation to protect the interest of depositors and that the non-deposit taking NBFCs do not pose any such risk and therefore need not be regulated.", "It was, however, realised that the inter-linkages of these NBFCs with the other components of the financial system have grown over the years and their growing presence in various financial markets could, in the absence of regulatory steps lead to risk transfers which could have systemic implications.", "You are well aware how in the recent past, through a gradual non-disruptive process, an attempt has been made to bring systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs under a more harmonised regulatory framework, including the capital adequacy norms and exposure norms.", "These measures have reduced the unlimited leverage possibilities available to NBFCs.", "(vii) Another important aspect has been the treatment of off balance sheet exposures and consolidation of off balance sheet vehicles and conduits.", "While applying prudential norms, there is need to treat off-balance sheet transactions similar to on balance sheet transactions for the purpose of capital adequacy norms and risk management.", "In the case of off balance sheet vehicles a broader view needs to be taken from a prudential point of view on consolidation.", "The critical issue should be not merely the ownership but where the risk resides.", "In this context, a review of the current conversion factors and risk weights for off balance sheet items is necessary.", "Similarly it is recognized that the potential liquidity risks also need to be captured.", "Pursuant to the announcement in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008, the RBI over a period and after consultations with market participants has announced the following measures: o Strengthening of the capital adequacy norms for off balance sheet transactions covering foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.", "It mandated use of current exposure method for measuring the credit equivalent amount i.e.", "the exposures had to be marked to market, and prescribed provisioning requirement for the exposure amount as applicable to standard assets of the concerned counterparty.", "Credit conversion factors were also increased across maturities.", "o In regard to asset classification it was clarified that the amount due on a derivative contract will be treated as NPA if not received within 90 days.", "In that case all other funded facilities granted to the client will also be classified as non-performing asset following the principle of borrower-wise classification as per the existing asset classification norms.", "However, in the case of complex derivative contracts that were entered into between April 2007 and June 2008, the RBI suggested that the unpaid amounts may be parked in a separate account and borrower wise classification will not apply.", "In cases where a derivative contract is restructured, the MTM value of the contract on the date of the restructuring should be cash settled.", "(viii) While the factors responsible for the crisis are many, one that is being debated widely is the contribution of fair value accounting framework for complex and conventional financial instruments in amplifying the crisis.", "The problem lies in the procyclical nature of the standard and the difficulty in valuing financial instruments when markets are illiquid or in distressed conditions.", "Although fair value may increase transparency of the company accounts, it may not always reflect the true intrinsic value in both upswings and under excessively stressed market conditions.", "There is a need to distinguish the basic financial and prudential analysis from a purely \"financial\" accounting framework.", "There is also need to clearly appreciate that the accounting reporting has a role as a source of information and as such will indicate the value of the company at the moment of the statement of accounts.", "Fair value for prudential purposes is more forward looking in its approach as it includes not only incurred losses but also expected losses.", "This tension can be addressed by the regulators addressing the regulatory and prudential aspects in the case of banks.", "Keeping in view the systemic implications of the standards, regulators will have to carry out an indepth assessment of the concepts and tools relating to valuation.", "(ix) Great emphasis is now being laid on implementing a central counterparty for OTC derivatives particularly for credit default swaps.", "Well regulated counterparties reduce potential for disruption in financial markets and promote operational efficiencies and transparency.", "In India as early as in 2001, the Clearing Corporation of India was set up to settle interbank spot forex transactions and all outright and repo transactions in government securities whether negotiated or order driven systems.", "CCIl has also introduced a collateralised money market instrument called CBLO which is also settled through the CCP.", "CCIL has also commenced non-guaranteed settlement of OTC trades in interest rate swaps on 27 November 2008.", "Guaranteed settlement of these trades will commence later once we clarify the exposure requirements.", "In the near future it will also act as central counterparty for forward contracts which will mitigate risks releasing counterparty exposure limits.", "The margins are in the form of cash and government bonds ensuring the quality and liquidity of the settlement (x) Recent developments will also pave the way for more effective regulation rather than reliance on self regulation, credit rating agencies assessments or setting of standards by industry participants.", "(xi) Lastly, on the issue of selling of complex products, we have to collectively work towards a viable framework.", "In this context I would like to recount the application of a surprisingly simple idea to the realm of public policy that has received tremendous attention after being advocated by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their international bestseller \"Nudge\".", "The authors advocate the use of \"choice architecture\" by businesses or governments to influence choices in ways that encourage choosers to make decisions in their best interest.", "They call it \"libertarian paternalism\".", "This involves utilizing \"nudges\" such as the wording of choices in ways that influence individual actions, designing default choices (in the absence of action) that do not penalize individuals, limiting choices to those that are more comprehensible, taxing detrimental choices, and providing full disclosure to better inform decision-makers.", "I will urge FEDAI to take it up as a special assignment and suggest a framework that is both practical and implementable while ensuring the best interests of all stakeholders.", "The experience and lessons of the present crisis will be extremely useful for us in going forward with the process of financial market liberalisation.", "While there is not and should not be any stifling of innovations in the financial sector, it is important to distinguish financial innovation from conventional product, service or process innovation in terms of the systemic costs these entail.", "Socially useful as it is, financial innovation should not be allowed to outpace its understanding by the multitude of market participants and stake holders - a process facilitated by appropriate reporting, accounting and governance standards and enforced by regulatory and supervisory regime.", "FEDAI plays a special role in the foreign exchange market for ensuring smooth and speedy growth of the market in all its aspects.", "All authorised dealers are required to become members of the FEDAI and execute an undertaking to the effect that they would abide by the terms and conditions stipulated by the FEDAI for transacting foreign exchange business.", "As the forex market grows in the spot and derivative segments including currency futures, the FEDAI as a self regulatory organisation needs to focus on supporting orderly growth, promoting market integrity and sound practices with the ultimate objective of supporting the real economy.", "I wish the conference all success."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
