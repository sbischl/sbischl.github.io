constructive development, that industry players themselves see the value in doing so.", "Role of financial regulators In my remarks so far, it should be obvious that financial regulators will have active roles in the business and technology transformation in the banking industry.", "Regulators need to have a sharp understanding of emerging technologies and new business models, and to be alert to potential risks.", "Only then are we able to exercise thoughtful judgment.", "There will be a balance between supporting innovation and technology use, while pre-empting new or heightened risks

innovation in financial services, especially those that hold promise in raising efficiency, in creating new opportunities, in enabling new or value-adding services or simply to manage risks better.",

activity poses.", "For example, in the new Payment Services Bill that MAS has consulted on, regulatory requirements for payment activities will be differentiated according to the risks that specific

banking industry.", "One is the important issue of financial inclusion.", "In the quest to innovate and as banks develop the sophistication to sharpen the profile of each customer, we should not overlook the need for financial inclusion - especially access to basic banking and financial services for under-served communities.", "Another area is in the responsible use of technology tools.", "Earlier this month, MAS announced the setting up of a regulator-industry grouping to co-create a guide to promote the responsible and ethical use of AI and data analytics by financial institutions.",
