both by the credit issuers themselves supplying information and credit services over the Internet and by Internet-based brokerage sites finding the cheapest mortgages for borrowers.", "While Internet-based mortgage services are still a relatively new phenomenon, they are likely to increase competition on the mortgage market.", "However, if we look at the spread between the cost of borrowing and the lending rate for mortgage institutions, there is no indication that the interest margin for mortgage institutions has fallen as a result of increased competition (Figure 5).",

the case with the Swedish benchmark bonds.", "Thanks to significant lending volumes and strong price formation on domestic loans, the mortgage institutions have also been able to compete successfully on the international bond market.", "Borrowing against the entire balance sheet as security requires significant risk capital or some form of guarantees from the owners.", "All mortgage institutions,

increase central European investors' interest in Swedish housing bonds.", "As long as Sweden is not a member of EMU and as long as Swedish borrowers want to borrow in Swedish kronor, the foreign exchange risk will remain.", "Increasing competition on the mortgage market will entail a greater need for new forms of financing that are more economical with the institution's risk capital.", "Two financing forms being used increasingly by foreign mortgage institutions are gilt-edged bonds and securitisation.", "Gilt-edged bonds In Denmark and Germany, mortgages are primarily financed through specially regulated secure bonds.", "These secure bonds are mainly housing bonds with clearly defined collateral.", "Security for this type of bond is regulated by law and the bonds are subject to strict supervision by authorities.", "The German and Danish secure bonds have been given special treatment in EU directives.", "Under this special treatment, member states can exempt insurance companies and fund companies from the normal requirements for spreading risk for these bonds and a lower risk weighting can be applied when calculating capital adequacy requirements.", "The government has instigated an investigation into whether gilt-edged bonds could be introduced in Sweden.", "In brief, the proposal means that a priority right would apply for this type of bond, that clear limits would be defined for the collateral ratio (max 75% for residential property) and that collateral would be identified in a special register controlled by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.", "The proposal is currently being examined by the Ministry of Finance.", "The main argument in favour of allowing Swedish mortgage institutions to issue gilt-edged bonds is that such bonds are issued by European competitors and are already established on the market.", "Gilt-edged bonds would thereby be easier to sell to investors, would involve higher liquidity and give lower interest rates than traditional Swedish housing bonds.", "This would facilitate the mortgage institutions' financing and would hopefully result in lower interest rates for consumers.", "However, the Riksbank is critical towards the proposal on account of the doubtful role that the national supervisory authority would assume by taking responsibility for ensuing that the total collateral for the loan is intact.", "The supervision of Finansinspektionen may create the impression that the government is assuming special responsibility for the security of the bonds, and this is not the intention.", "Special legislation on gilt-edged bonds is likely to entail a return to tighter market regulation as mortgage institutions would be granted a special status on the capital market.", "What economic reason motivates to show favour to a certain group of borrowers?", "It is not obvious that gilt-edged bonds would contribute to reducing the mortgage institutions' total financing costs.", "Gilt-edged bonds can only be issued against security up to a certain limit of the collateral value.", "It is likely that the remaining stock of non-secured loans will become more expensive to finance.", "The use of gilt-edged bonds may lead to lower financing costs for the issuing mortgage institutions if these institutions do not have to bear the cost of the special supervision that gilt-edged bonds require.", "In my opinion, the increasing competition will promote new forms of funding that make more efficient use of equity.", "One financing form that permits the efficient use of equity is securitisation.", "Securitisation involves a given loan stock with accompanying collateral being taken off the balance sheet of the mortgage institution and sold to a separate company specially created for this purpose (known as a special purpose vehicle).", "This separate company is then financed through issuing bonds on the market.", "The special purpose vehicle has a clearly defined risk scenario and does not pursue any business activities other than acting as holder of the specified loans.", "Consequently, the company is not subject to the capital adequacy regulations that apply for mortgage institutions.", "Securitisation has several advantages, the main one being that it enables mortgage institutions to reduce their share of equity and thereby their total financing cost, since equity is a more expensive source of financing than loan financing.", "Furthermore, mortgage institutions can streamline their operations by selling claims and by specialising in issuing loans.", "Securitisation can also increase the stability of the financial system as credit risks can be transferred from institutions subject to regulation to players that are less sensitive to heavy credit losses.", "Securitisation using a special purpose vehicle located in Sweden is permitted, but in practice it is unprofitable since, under the current regulations, the special purpose vehicle will be subject to the same capital adequacy regulations as the mortgage institutions.", "A proposal to improve the conditions for securitisation in Sweden is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Finance.", "The Budget Bill for 2001 states that the government intends to put forward a bill on improved conditions for securitisation during autumn 2000.", "To date, three Swedish mortgage institutions, SBAB, SEB-Bola\u030an and Bokredit have undertaken securitisation via special purpose vehicles abroad.", "On five occasions between 1990 and 1994, SEB securitised mortgage loans totalling SEK 12 billion, and in June 2000, the same bank securitised mortgage loans worth approximately SEK 8.5 billion.", "SBAB securitised mortgages worth approximately SEK 1 billion in February 2000 and loans worth approximately SEK 8 billion in October 2000.", "Bokredit, owned by Den Danske Bank, has securitised a stock of mortgage loans to a value of SEK 1.3 billion.", "A new Internet-based issuer of mortgage loans is Europeloan, which started up operations in Sweden in February 1999.", "Europeloan is financing their internet based mortgage lending by securitisation of the loans abroad, up to now around SEK 0,5 billion.", "Objections that have been expressed against securitisation include the fact that up until now it has been relatively complicated and costly to set up special purpose vehicles, and it has not been possible to invest the bonds at such favourable interest rates as their rating would imply.", "Possible reasons are that the market is underdeveloped and the issues have been few, which has meant that liquidity in the bonds has been low.", "Securitisation of mortgages is common in the USA, where around half of the total outstanding loans stock of secured loans is securitised.", "In Europe, housing financing has mainly taken other forms.", "If competition in the mortgage market increases as a result of EMU, it is likely that the need to finance mortgage loans as economically as possible will also increase.", "Taking this into account, it is not unreasonable to believe that securitisation will become a more attractive option.", "Increased competition can thus lead to a growing market for securitisation.", "Alternatively, the opposite may apply, ie that improved opportunities for securitisation will increase competition.", "This is what happened in Australia, where the mortgage market was deregulated during the 1990s.", "Legislation facilitating securitisation reduced the previously high market entry barriers, paved the way for new players and reduced costs for borrowers by as much as a couple of percentage points.", "Overall, most factors point to an increase in competition on the mortgage market.", "New forms of financing, new technology and possible EMU participation will contribute to reducing costs for new players trying to enter the mortgage market.", "Since mortgages are standardised products, lenders will compete on price, ie the rate of interest on the loan.", "The financing issue will therefore be a decisive one for issuers of mortgages.", "Traditionally, mortgage institutions have financed their operations by borrowing using their entire balance sheet as collateral.", "This method of financing is relatively expensive for mortgage institutions and as competition on the mortgage market increases, so will the need for cheaper methods of financing.", "Securitisation and gilt-edged bonds have been discussed as possible methods for mortgage institutions to reduce their financing costs.", "Of these two financing methods, securitisation stands out as having the greatest potential for reducing financing costs, since securitisation makes the most efficient use of equity."], "classifications": ["none",
