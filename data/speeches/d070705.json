first is the impact of the economic climate that the country is currently facing.", "As the economic decline reduces real incomes, policyholders may default on premiums and even surrender their

reporting standards.", "As a result of these new standards, we have seen a fall in asset values of insurance companies, which has reduced their solvency surplus in 2006.", "Those affected by this

one moment pretend to know all the answers.", "But a few things that we need to keep in mind as we collectively search for solutions: \u2022 First, we need to develop a total economic program.", "This holistic approach is extremely critical to ensure that all policies are pulling in the same consistent direction all the time.", "It will also bring transparency, certainty and predictability to economic policies.", "Secondly, we have to adopt a medium term view rather than a short term one.", "We all know that economic statistics come at a lag and they do fluctuate from month to month.", "In

do.", "Often, we know what we need to do.", "Even overseas analysts tell us what we already know.", "But unfortunately, we take our time getting those things done.", "I believe that we are now in a situation that we must act.", "We need to do all we can to build confidence, remove barriers to investment, raise exports, execute reforms, resolve the land tenure issue and so forth.", "We are currently projecting an economic turn around in 2008.", "We should be able to achieve this.", "Moreover, we should aim to exceed the 2 percent growth estimated for 2008 and we can easily do what we need to do now.", "On monetary policy, as I said, foreign reserves have stabilized.", "This implies that our policies are working to slow down consumption.", "But it can also be the result of the economic downturn and the delay in major investment projects which have sizeable import contents.", "Exports are still not performing.", "So we are still concerned about the medium term.", "In such a time like this we have to be pragmatic about what we can do.", "Our credit ceiling will be in place for some time.", "We have allowed liquidity to rise which has led to commercial banks reducing their lending rates.", "And we have announced that only applications for advance payments for imports more than F$15,000 will require Bank approval.", "The Bank believes that this policy measure will facilitate trade payments and assist importers meet their overseas commitments.", "Let me add here that the Bank is not considering any devaluation of the currency.", "Of course, today, we are here to
