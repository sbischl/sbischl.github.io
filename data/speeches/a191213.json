and hence liquidity - in SARON swaps has been low.", "This will change once more SARON-based cash products become available.", "The successful transitioning away from Libor therefore hinges on the development of such products.", "In order for SARON to be used as the reference rate for cash products, a longer-term interest rate must be calculated from the daily rate.", "As early as 2018, the NWG recommended various options for calculating an average interest rate based on realised SARON values.", "This approach, known as compounding, is also gaining traction abroad.", "A wide range of options for calculating such average rates has been proposed and evaluated.", "At its latest meeting, the NWG was more specific and narrowed down its set of recommended options.", "As a result, market participants can now begin embedding the compounding approach in products such as mortgages.", "In addition to new SARON-based cash products, solutions must be found for existing Liborbased products.", "Ideally, these will be replaced by new, SARON-based contracts.", "At the very least, the existing contracts must be furnished with fallback clauses, which will come into effect when Libor is no longer available as a reference rate.", "I should stress that it is evident that the Swiss franc Libor will cease to exist.", "The stage has been set for the transition to SARON, and it is now up to market participants to use the time until the end of 2021 to complete the work that remains to be done.", "A successful transition from Libor to SARON is crucial for the smooth functioning of the Swiss franc money and capital markets.", "Importance of climate risks for the SNB's investment policy I would now like to say a few words about the importance of climate risks for the SNB's investment policy.", "Let me start by summarising this policy.", "Our asset management is governed by the primacy of monetary policy.", "In applying its investment policy, the SNB has two main objectives.", "The first is to ensure that the balance sheet can be used for monetary policy purposes at any time.", "In particular, the SNB must be in a position to expand or shrink its balance sheet if needed.", "The second objective is to preserve the value of currency reserves in the long term.", "A high degree of asset liquidity and diversification is required to ensure sufficient room for manoeuvre in the implementation of monetary policy.", "As the SNB does not pursue any strategic or structural objectives with its investments, it seeks to achieve the broadest possible market coverage in managing its assets.", "So what do climate risks mean for the SNB's investment policy?", "In the context of investment policy, climate risks are not fundamentally different from other financial risks - they too can trigger or amplify market fluctuations, which influence the attractiveness of certain assets.", "By opting for broad coverage of entire markets, the SNB takes into account the complexity of the many different risks.", "We regularly review changes in the risk landscape and factor them into our investment policy where necessary.", "Furthermore, as an investor the SNB has long had in place a clear set of exclusion criteria for companies that violate Switzerland's fundamental norms and values.", "For instance, it does not invest in companies that systematically cause severe environmental damage.", "Given the monetary policy requirements of our mandate, we are convinced that the approach we have chosen is appropriate.", "Foundation of the BIS Innovation Hub In October, the SNB announced that it was collaborating with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to establish the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Switzerland.", "This Hub Centre, which is scheduled to commence operations at the beginning of 2020 alongside the Hub Centres in Hong Kong and Singapore, will initially focus on two projects.", "The first will examine the integration of central bank money into a distributed ledger technology infrastructure, with a view to facilitating the settlement of tokenised assets between financial institutions.", "With respect to integrating digital central bank money, the focus is on two options: an SNB-issued digital token for financial institutions ('wholesale central bank digital currency') and an interface with the Swiss Interbank Clearing payment system.", "The project will be carried out as part of a collaboration between the SNB and SIX Digital Exchange in the form of a proof of concept.", "The second project will address the growing demands placed on central banks to be able to track and monitor fast-paced electronic markets.", "We are convinced that the work of the new BIS Innovation Hub will make an important contribution to central banks' understanding of developments in the fintech area."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Libor transition", "Climate risks", "Swiss franc money market", "Financial markets", "Monetary policy", "BIS Innovation Hub", "SARON", "Investment policy", "Economic concerns", "Political uncertainty"]}
