which comprises the ECB and national central banks of the euro area - will develop its own stance on the matter and will contribute to ESMA's assessment.", "At the end of this process, ESMA may recommend that the Commission deny the UK CCPs recognition to provide certain clearing services or activities in the EU if they pose excessive risks to financial stability.", "If this recommendation were to affect eurodenominated clearing services, the Eurosystem's agreement would also be required.", "The ECB will consider the costs and benefits of any such measure very carefully, as we are well aware of its far-reaching impact on derivatives markets as well as the challenges this would pose for all involved.", "Requiring more critical services to be provided by EU CCPs would also make our domestic clearing landscape more systemically important, and would increase crossborder risks within the EU.", "In such a scenario, the current framework for supervising EU CCPs - which still largely relies on national authorities and gives ESMA and the Eurosystem a limited role - would not be fit for purpose.", "In this situation, it would be essential for EU authorities to have control over clearing activities that are systemic to the EU and critical to the transmission and conduct of monetary policy.", "This would require the EU dimension of CCP supervision to be scaled up.", "Investors are adapting to the post-Brexit landscape.", "For example, in January 2021 the trading of euro-denominated shares moved from London to venues in Amsterdam and Paris.", "This followed the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) requiring that shares listed in the EU only be traded by EU market participants on EU-regulated venues, or on third-country infrastructures considered \"equivalent\" by the Commission.", "The trading of EU carbon contracts is also expected to move from London to Amsterdam.", "For OTC derivatives, the redistribution of trading has been less clear-cut in direction, with dealers moving some activities to EU trading venues and others to US venues, the latter having equivalence arrangements with both the EU and the United Kingdom.", "Towards a well-functioning capital markets union in the EU The events of the past year -
