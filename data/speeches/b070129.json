that commensurate with full employment - is now at a higher level.", "At the same time, financial stability and price stability have been maintained.", "This background allowed for cumulative interest rate cuts in recent months such that now, for the first time, there is a significant negative interest rate gap of 0.75 percentage points, between the Bank of Israel and the US Fed rates.", "These achievements are beginning to give us encouraging signs regarding certain improvements in two problematic areas that the economy faces: The public sector debt burden.", "This, one of the biggest problems in the Israeli economy, fell to about 88 percent of GDP compared to 97 percent at the end of 2005.", "This is a remarkable achievement, but it is important that we continue along this path to bring the ratio down to 60 percent of GDP -

a measure principally of social gaps - but also a measure of absolute poverty.", "This is a measure of the individual's ability to purchase a basket of essential goods.", "We have therefore been closely following developments of a measure of the poverty line, calculated in real terms since our base year (which we've taken as 1997 for calculation purposes).", "From our analyses, we see that in 2005 there was some drop in absolute poverty after it had risen in the years 2001 to 2004.", "Those years where the absolute poverty index rose could be attributed to the period of recession in economic activity, and in 2004, individuals were suffering from the effects of cutbacks in welfare payments which continued gradually even after the recession.", "The drop in poverty in 2005 could be attributed to the growth that began in 2003.", "By the way, though poverty was seen to rise in 2005 - according to the relative measurement - it rose more moderately than in previous years.", "Only in a few months time, when the Incomes Survey for 2006 is published, will we be able to see what happened with poverty - both in relative and absolute terms - in the past year and we all hope that we'll find that economic growth continues to positively affect all levels of society.", "We all have a tendency to praise ourselves for our achievements and blame external forces when things go wrong.", "But the truth is that some of the achievements in the Israeli economy in 2006 stemmed from the favorable condition of the world economy; almost everywhere, and in particular the emerging market economies, registered rapid growth and low inflation in 2006.", "But even after taking into account the external factors, we may still attribute an important part of our economic achievements to our own actions.", "I'll start with macroeconomic policy.", "And I refer to the government's budget policy - and this year the government managed to steer the state budget for 2007 through the Knesset very shortly after the end of 2006 - and to the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy.", "And it is impossible not to note the most important role: that of the business sector, which for years has grown at a faster pace than the economy in general.", "Looking forward, we estimate that the economy will grow this year by 4.6 percent and that inflation will reach the target range of 1-3 percent.", "In terms of inflation-over-the-past-12-months, this is expected only by the fourth quarter of the year.", "In any case, the Bank of Israel's policy is to adjust the interest rate gradually as and when needed, to avoid unnecessary shocks to the economy and the financial markets.", "I would like to add a few words about the many affairs that are termed -
