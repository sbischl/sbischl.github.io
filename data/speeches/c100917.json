standards will contribute to a lower incidence of financial crises.", "The severity of financial crises could also be reduced.", "The economy should benefit from smoother economic cycles.", "Higher standards should help to reduce the risk that resources are misallocated.", "To put the magnitude of potential gains into context, consider more closely the costs of financial crises.", "In the 10 years following a financial crisis, the median output growth rate decreases by 1 per cent, and the unemployment rate increases by 5 percentage points.", "Experience suggests that costs build well into the future.", "In studies released last month, the Basel Committee found that the median cumulative loss of past financial crises was 63 per cent of national GDP.", "Given the scale of potential losses, there are clearly large benefits to reducing the frequency of crises (Chart 2).", "The extensive analysis of the Basel Committee suggests that higher capital and liquidity standards would do just that.", "In particular, the combination of strengthened liquidity standards and a 2-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios would raise the annual expected level of GDP by 1.8 per cent relative to trend.", "Because this improved performance accrues over time, it is a gift that keeps on giving.", "Using a conservative real discount rate of 5 per cent, the cumulative present value of this better performance is equivalent to more than 35 per cent of GDP, or \u20ac0.9 trillion for Germany.", "Some in Canada argue that our sound financial system implies that the potential gains are small for our country and the G-20 reforms are, therefore, unimportant.", "In open economies such as ours and Germany's, reducing the incidence of foreign crises is even more important than domestic benefits.", "Today's reality is one of deep interconnectedness, where financial problems in other regions spill rapidly into our own.", "In an increasingly multipolar economy, we simply cannot afford to lurch from crisis to crisis every five years.", "To reduce this frequency, we need a strong, universally applied framework.", "The Basel III rules, combined with the FSB and IMF's review processes, have the potential to be just that.", "Despite the clear benefits, stronger prudential standards also impose costs.", "Banks can follow several strategies to meet regulatory demands for higher capital requirements.", "Most obviously, they could raise additional capital in public markets.", "If given sufficient time, they could generate capital internally through retained earnings.", "In addition, they could pass on some of the costs of the higher standards to their customers through higher interest spreads or increased fee income.", "Finally, they could shed, or slow the growth, of assets.", "Past experience suggests that banks will use a combination of all these methods.", "However, to be conservative, the Basel report assumes that banks would recoup the cost of higher capital and liquidity requirements entirely through higher lending spreads.", "The long-term estimate of the increase in lending spreads is then used as an input to a variety of models to assess the impact on output.", "By combining strengthened liquidity standards with a 2-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios, expected output growth, relative to trend, is reduced by 0.25 per cent on average for the countries analysed (0.30 per cent for Canada).", "In present-value terms, this equates to about 5 per cent of GDP.", "Together with these long-run costs, there are also costs incurred during the transition period.", "The Basel study estimates these through a sophisticated approach using a wide range of models.", "The result for the group is a 1.1 per cent cumulative reduction in GDP over a four-year transition period (in present value).", "A conservative estimate of the net benefits Netting the long-run benefits of less frequent financial crises with the long-run and transition costs yields average net benefits for G-20 economies of 30 per cent of GDP in present-value terms, or about \u20ac10 trillion (Table 1).", "The analysis understates the benefits of the new rules and errs on the side of overstating the costs.", "This bias is reflected in several key assumptions.", "First, banks are assumed to fully pass on the costs of higher capital and liquidity requirements to borrowers rather than reducing their current returns on shareholders' equity or operating expenses, such as compensation, to adjust to the new rules.", "If banks were to reduce personnel expenses by only 10 per cent (equal to a 5 per cent reduction in operating expenses), they could lower spreads by an amount that would completely offset the impact of a 2-percentage-point increase in capital requirements.", "Second, higher capital and liquidity requirements are assumed to have a permanent effect on lending spreads, and hence on the level of economic output.", "No allowance is made for the possibility that households and firms may find cheaper alternative sources of financing.", "Third, the discount rate used to calculate net benefits was more than twice current real interest rates and the longer-run real growth rates of the Canadian and German economies.", "Finally, the benefit quantified is the gains to GDP resulting from a reduced probability of future financial crises.", "Other benefits from financial reforms are substantial However, there are a variety of other potential benefits from higher capital and liquidity standards and the broader range of G-20 reforms.", "First, the variability of economic cycles should be reduced by a host of macroprudential measures.", "Analysis by the Bank of Canada and the Basel group suggests a modest dampening in output volatility can be achieved from the Basel III proposals, as higher capital and liquidity allow banks to smooth the supply of credit over the cycle.", "For instance, a 2-percentage-point rise in capital ratios lowers the standard deviation of output by about 3 per cent.", "A much more significant impact can be expected from other macroprudential instruments under consideration.", "These include varying loan-to-value and other credit terms in mortgage markets, adopting through-the-cycle margining in core funding markets, and the introduction of countercyclical capital buffers.", "The Bank of Canada has modelled the potential impact of such a time-varying buffer and translated the gains from reduced volatility into domestic consumption and GDP.", "The preliminary findings suggest that the potential gains are in the range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent of GDP in present-value terms.", "In other words, countercyclical buffers alone could increase the net benefits of reforms by about 20 per cent.", "It is reasonable to expect similar results for other countries.", "Second, there is a range of initiatives under consideration to reduce moral hazard, including new frameworks for the effective resolution of banks, more intensive supervision of key institutions, the introduction of contingent capital, and the creation of more robust infrastructure.", "Adoption of these measures should further reinforce the ability of Basel III standards to reduce the probability of crises and thereby increase net benefits.", "Third, the totality of the G-20 reforms has the potential to shift the balance between resiliency and competition.", "By creating a system that is robust to the failure of a single firm, reforms could increase the competitive intensity in the financial services sector, with attendant benefits.", "A financial sector that is less volatile, less prone to debilitating crises, and more robust in the face of adverse shocks is likely to be viewed more favourably by investors and attract the investment needed to continue to expand in a sustainable manner.", "By reducing moral hazard, incumbents will also enjoy fewer oligopolistic privileges behind regulatory barriers to entry.", "Greater competition commonly leads to more innovative and diverse strategies, which would further promote resiliency of the system.", "Greater competition and safer banks may also contribute to lower expected return on equity (ROE) for financial institutions.", "This, in turn, could help offset the costs and increase the net benefits discussed earlier.", "These gains from competition could be considerable.", "The financial services sector earns a 50 per cent higher return on equity than the economy-wide average.", "If greater competition leads to a one-percentage-point decline in the ROE (through a decline in spreads), the estimated cost from a one-percentage point increase in capital would be completely offset.", "The fundamental objective of the reforms is to create a system that efficiently supports economic growth while providing financial consumers with choice.", "The system must be robust to shocks, dampening, rather than amplifying, their effect on the real economy.", "It should also support sensible innovation.", "The system needs stable banks and robust markets, since both play a central role in financing, and, if properly structured, each can support the other.", "This means ensuring that individual financial institutions are stronger and less systemically important, that more options for liquidity are available in all states of the world, and that the new measures promote competition.", "A fully risk-proofed system is neither attainable nor desirable.", "The point is not to pile up so much capital in our institutions that they are never heard from again, either as a source of instability or of growth.", "The challenge is to get the balance between resiliency and efficiency right.", "The Basel III agreement accomplishes these objectives.", "Moreover, a careful analysis indicates that the economic case for the reforms is compelling.", "Most fundamentally, successful implementation of the G-20 agenda will increase the likelihood of an open, flexible international financial and trading system.", "Modern Germany has prospered in this environment and has a great stake in leading the G-20 in building a more secure foundation for modern prosperity.", "The Bundesbank has led the development of many of these reforms.", "Tremendous progress was made this past weekend, but there is still more to do.", "Germany's continued leadership in the coming weeks and months will be critical, so that we can finish building a solid financial foundation for growth and social improvement.", "We should all heed the words of
