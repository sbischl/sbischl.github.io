"There has never been a target level for the ringgit exchange rate.", "With the economy and financial markets constantly evolving, fixation on a particular level of ringgit exchange rate is counterproductive, if not detrimental to the economy.", "What matters for Bank Negara and all of us here is to ensure that any adjustments taking place is done in a gradual and orderly manner, without causing undue disruptions to businesses and households.", "The foreign exchange market can sometimes be very fickle.", "Therefore, we should always remain on our guard, as the global economic and financial conditions may change rapidly following many developments such as normalisation of interest rates, geopolitical risks and the tendency to adopt policies that might curtail open trade.", "The ringgit's recent appreciation and stability is not something that we should take for granted.", "What we have learnt in recent years is to never downplay the unexpected.", "The rapid decline in global oil prices, drastic disruptive policy shifts in major economies, and the more recent increase in trade tensions are prime examples of tail-risk events that will continue to affect our economy and the ringgit.", "Similar to the Malaysian economy, while we have witnessed progress and growth of the Malaysian takaful industry, moving to the next level requires us to move away from status quo and to do things differently.", "Therefore I urge the industry to not waste any more time in thinking anew and strengthening its capacity to play a much more meaningful role in supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth.", "Let us all be committed to realise the values that are fundamental to the benevolent mission of takaful.", "I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate
