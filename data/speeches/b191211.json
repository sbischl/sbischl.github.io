us.", "At stake is our ability to preserve public confidence in the financial system, and seize an unprecedented opportunity to come within striking distance of at least six of the Sustainable Development Goals: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality and reducing inequality.", "This Conference, themed \"Empowering financial consumers in the

financially and digitally literate consumers.", "Safeguarding the interests of consumers without stifling innovation remains one of the most difficult balances to achieve for regulators.", "Regulators are constantly trading off considerations of privacy against efficiency; fragmentation against competition; access against risks of abuse.", "In the digital age, these trade-offs become impossible without equipping consumers with the information, knowledge and tools that they need to protect themselves and make decisions that are in their own best interests.", "It is only through a

of the specific challenges that financial services authorities will have to contend with in the digital era.", "Increasing incidents of data abuse on social media platforms, security breaches and cybersecurity threats can sow mistrust and confidence deficits in digital systems.", "In our respective markets, these incidents are likely to reveal gaps in existing data protection and consumer protection regimes and the need to explicitly address ownership rights and permitted uses of personal customer information.", "Prospects of digital profiling, and decisions driven by the use of complex algorithms can also result in financial consumers being unfairly discriminated against or targeted by unsolicited and unscrupulous marketing campaigns.", "Rather than delivering on its vast promise, digitalisation could instead become a polarising and divisive instrument.", "Take the provision of online credit, for example, the use of algorithm-based online credit scoring tools have led

shift from just addressing customer touchpoints, to the consideration of consumer needs much earlier in the product design process, in the formulation of distribution strategies or in the setting of risk limits.", "Predictive models used for decision-making must be subject to regular reviews against consumer outcomes and redress channels need to be aligned with the digital experience.", "Indeed, we should be concerned that while the delivery of financial products and services is taking on increasingly digital dimensions, when something goes wrong, processes for consumers to seek redress are still heavily manual in nature.", "As for financial education, I am reminded of the old adage by Sir Francis Bacon: \"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, writing an exact man\".",

speed and convenience.", "The short attention spans of financial consumers are further constrained by an overload of information and misinformation.", "Digital solutions that can efficiently deliver financial education to masses of people, while simultaneously providing capabilities to tailor knowledge and information to one's personal circumstances (such as through loan affordability calculators), have gained increasing traction.", "However, the fact that digital interventions are more cost-efficient, accessible and scalable, do not automatically make them any more effective than more traditional interventions in the past that have failed to achieve a consistent and lasting impact in changing behaviour.", "We need to develop reliable insights into behavioural influences that may help or prevent consumers from making good financial decisions.", "This sounds simple in theory, but is as complex as an understanding of human psychology itself.", "As our understanding evolves,
