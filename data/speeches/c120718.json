BCBS has formulated what is called the Basel III framework aiming at increase the resilience of banks through prescription of a higher quality, quantity, consistency and better risk coverage of capital.", "The set of reforms for Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) are aimed at reducing the probability of failure of these large and complex financial institutions and at putting in place a robust resolution framework so that the institutions can be winded down in an orderly manner, should they fail.", "Regulatory perimeter issues are being addressed by putting in place a regulatory framework for the shadow banking system.", "Another set of reforms are aimed at strengthening financial market infrastructures by addressing issues in the OTC derivatives markets by ensuring that the transactions in these markets are reported, centrally cleared and, where possible, settled through a central counterparty.", "v.

crucial segment of infrastructure which functioned effectively during the financial crisis was the payment and settlement system infrastructure.", "Payment Systems are the channels through which liquidity risks can get exacerbated and could very quickly turn into credit and systemic risks.", "In this sphere of payment systems, the measures taken by central banks the world-over in strengthening risk management in payment systems by introducing Real Time Gross Settlement Systems and encouraging the private sector to set up CLS Bank for PvP transactions for settling foreign exchange transactions is indeed laudable.", "It was therefore found expedient in the wake of the financial crisis to revisit the existing three sets of standards which have guided the development of risk management standards in payment systems and securities settlement systems.", "Together the two international-standard setting bodies in this area the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have published the \"Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures\" (PFMI) in April 2012.", "The PFMIs replace the three

categorized into nine broad categories: (a) general organization (b) credit and liquidity risk management (c) settlement (d) CSDs and exchange-of-value settlement systems (e) default management (f)

and development of better standards for risk management both in the area of supervision and regulation of banks and financial institutions and in payment and settlement systems.", "Regulatory convergence and its impact on India The direct effect of the global financial crisis on Indian banks/ financial sector was muted because of limited exposure of our banking industry to complex innovative products and other prudential policies put in place by the Reserve Bank of India.", "The relatively lower presence of foreign banks in the Indian banking sector also minimized the direct impact on the domestic economy.", "India is exposed to the spill-over effects of the regulatory polices adopted by the systemically important jurisdictions in the World.", "Volatile cross-border capital flows are one such manifestation.", "To the extent that these systemically important jurisdictions harmonize and converge to agreed international best practices, there could be positive externalities from the Indian stand point.", "The need for convergence in banking regulation stems from the fact that while banking has become global, banking regulation is national.", "Therefore, addressing the issue of regulatory arbitrage is at the centre-stage of policy concern.", "The international standard setters have been attempting to achieve convergence by issuing broad principles that should inform national regulatory frameworks, which are peer reviewed under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for ensuring cross-border harmonization.", "While formulating national regulatory policies, national authorities are expected to exercise constrained discretion on certain aspects.", "As regards adoption of global regulatory reform agenda by India, it needs to be mentioned that a number of measures based on the principles that are now accepted internationally were already brought into practice even before the recent crisis.", "These included stringent liquidity requirements, countercyclical prudential measures, not recognizing in Tier I capital many items that are now sought to be deducted internationally, amortization of profits from sale of securitized assets to SPVs over the life of the securities issued, not reckoning unrealized gains in earnings or in Tier I capital, etc.", "The same applies to payment and settlement systems as well.", "Notwithstanding the above, the adoption of new principles will no doubt pose challenges in certain areas.", "A concern which has been raised globally is that the adoption of Basel III capital requirements by banks would push down their RoE to an extent.", "This could have implications for investments into the banking sector.", "However, it is expected that by looking at the benefits of implementation of Basel III capital requirements by way of increasing resilience of the banking system, investors will get adjusted to the new reality.", "Though Indian banks have an undisputed advantage of a strong starting base in the form of a higher CRAR with a larger component of Core Equity Capital therein, going ahead raising additional capital would be a big challenge.", "This has to be overcome by carefully calibrated capital planning exercise by the management of banks and RBI and the Government of India being the owner of public sector banks will have to play a proactive role in this process.", "The broader endeavour of global convergence in the banking or payment system regulations would, however, have to account for the country-specific idiosyncrasies to enable customized adoption of guidance of international standard setters as already recognized in many cases.", "For instance, the BCBS guidance on the conduct of the countercyclical capital buffer for India may require some adjustment/changes as the recommended matric of credit-to-GDP ratio could potentially adversely impact the structural drivers underlying credit growth in India.", "Thus, there may be a need for some adjustments to capital buffer guidance.", "Similarly the impact of new capital and margining rules for CCPs and OTC derivatives may require readjustments in India.", "Again the developments relating to Trade Repositories and Lead Entity Indicator approach to trades have implications for India.", "These aspects are being examined within RBI.", "Issues specific to Chhattisgarh Economy and banking scenario of the state Chhattisgarh is one of the youngest States of the Indian Nation.", "Constituted on 1st November, 2000, Chhattisgarh is located in the

from Left Wing Extremism (LWE) and progress is relatively slower in these districts.", "There has been a consistent growth in the deposits and advances of banks over the last five years but the CD ratio remains below the expected level of 60%.", "Another significant factor is that Chhattisgarh has been one of the few States where the target for provision of banking services to villages having population above 2000 has been achieved.", "There were 1050 villages identified for provision of banking services by March 2012.", "Opportunities in Chhattisgarh The State has huge deposits of minerals.", "It is one of the few power surplus States in the country.", "The gender ratio is above the national level (991:1000).", "Steady GDP growth over the past few years has created a good investment climate in the State.", "Chhattisgarh with its immense natural beauty has got the potential to be one of the best tourism destinations in the country.", "The economy of the State is primarily agricultural but a major part of the agricultural land is mono-cropping in the absence of sufficient irrigation facilities.", "In order to bring more land under multi-cropping, minor irrigation schemes should be focused upon.", "KCCs need to be made available to all eligible farmers and we are quite far from that target.", "In cases where proper land records are not available or cases pertaining to \"share croppers/oral lessees\", Joint Liability Groups (JLG) need to be formed so that crop loans are made available to these farmers.", "Farm mechanization is the need of the hour, as without modern techniques and implements productivity cannot be enhanced.", "Chhattisgarh has been an under performer as far as Agricultural Term Loans (ATLs).", "Banks need to bring in more region specific products so that ATL off-take is increased and field level functionaries need to be sensitized that there is more to agricultural credit than just crop loans.", "Besides agriculture, MSME is the second largest sector as far as employment is concerned.", "The Empowered Committee on MSME in Chhattisgarh has done a fairly good job and the State has witnessed a steady growth in loans to this sector.", "Subsequent to the recommendations of High Level Task Force by Prime Minister, there is an increased focus on Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE).", "They are present in the State but the spread of these industries is very limited and keeping in view the huge employment potential in these industries, growth of MSEs should be facilitated by banks and Government.", "Workshops, meetings and sensitization programmes elaborating various Government sponsored schemes, banks schemes and availability of collateral free loans should be organized in each block.", "Education loans should be extended to all eligible students.", "Recently a news item mentioned that, more than a hundred students from tribal community residing in LWE areas got selected for engineering colleges.", "It is a great step forward and to ensure that such a process continues, the financial sector should provide all possible assistance.", "Financial inclusion has been a key performance area for all of us since the last few years.", "Chhattisgarh has made good progress on this front as 22 out of 27 districts have achieved 100% financial inclusion and the remaining districts are expected to achieve this target soon.", "Bankers and Government agencies deserve appreciation for having achieved the target of provision of banking services to villages having population more than 2000.", "This is just the beginning, we need to go miles and there is no room for complacence.", "Opening at least one bank account in each family and providing banking services through business correspondent are the initial steps, we need to make sure that people develop a habit of banking.", "Their credit, remittance and insurance related needs are met and financial products delivered at their doorstep.", "Financial literacy and awareness plays a vital role in holistic financial inclusion.", "Bankers and Government agencies need to incorporate financial literacy as a part of their action plans at all levels.", "RBI has been organizing Outreach and similar programmes but they are just to show the way, it is for the banking industry to take it further to each and every village.", "A proper schedule for such programmes may be prepared and RBI would extend all possible assistance to such initiatives by banks.", "Financial Literacy and Credit Counseling centers are being set up at district levels, the functioning of these FLCCs should be monitored closely by controlling heads of banks and necessary guidance should be provided.", "FLCCs should not function only at their office but they need to step out at rural markets, gram sabhas and schools to educate people about financial products.", "Looking at the banking statistics for the past five years it is observed that there is a gradual reduction in CD ratio.", "For a State featuring among the top in economic growth it is not comforting to note that the CD ratio is declining.", "It might be because of investments being made in the State resulting in greater growth of deposits.", "It has been mentioned that few large projects operating in the State have credit limits sanctioned from other States hence they cannot be included in advances for Chhattisgarh.", "Bankers need to address this issue, with CBS any customer can access his account from any branch, and this can be utilized by bankers in Chhattisgarh to sanction big ticket advances.", "Banks should have an area specific action plan for growth in advances keeping in view the huge potential available in the State.", "The State Government has signed MoUs with some major industries and they are likely to setup their project here, this opportunity should be grabbed by banks to boost up their advances.", "Business correspondents can also play a major part in increasing credit; banks can extend overdraft facility to MGNREGA workers.", "Keeping in view the huge number of such beneficiaries the resultant credit growth will be substantial.", "Concluding observations In view of the fact that regulatory failures are among the causes for the recent global financial crisis, globally, an endeavour has been underway to adopt regulatory reform agenda and thereby achieve a broad convergence of banking regulation across jurisdictions.", "The prospects of regulatory convergence could have positive implications for India as it could potentially address the negative spill-over effects of regulatory policies adopted by systemically important jurisdictions.", "However, the paradigm of regulatory convergence has to accommodate national imperatives of the individual jurisdictions to account, inter alia, for divergence in their stages of economic development, status of their financial markets and infrastructure.", "I would conclude by summing up the challenge in front of us by saying that the need of the hour is to think globally but act locally.", "In this backdrop it is important that all the regions of India are brought to the same level of economic growth and the banking sector has to play a catalystic role in this endeavour.", "I am sure that the banking system in Chhattisgarh will be able to meet this challenge and make this State a very prosperous and vibrant one in the coming days."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none",
