56 of them will participate on site, while 44 will do it remotely.", "This conference has a very versatile program.", "A series of sessions will address various topics such as cybersecurity risks, business continuity, top operating and emerging risks, incident reporting, risk appetite, risk culture, and key risk indicators.", "They will also cover issues such as Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), cloud services in the context of vendor risk management framework, and the review of maturity models and best practices.", "This broad program reflects how central bank non-financial risk management has evolved from a purely operational perspective to a wide and multidimensional vision that permeates the entire institution and gains increasingly more importance.", "It has now become a complex set of issues that encompasses a diversity of risks ranging from traditional operational risks to highly specialized risks such as those involving cybersecurity, business continuity, strategic areas, and even risks arising from third parties, among others.", "All these issues have a subtle and at the same time complex connection that must be identified first, to be effectively managed.", "In this task, it is important to strengthen the governance model to handle the constant challenges faced by central banks and to be able to communicate risk-related issues to the top management in an effective way.", "In this regard, it is essential to have well-defined responsibilities and to ingrain in the entire organization the conviction that everyone in our institutions is a key element in managing and mitigating risk exposure.", "In this endeavor, it is relevant to continue fostering a risk culture throughout the institution.", "For this reason, it is imperative to have a clear view of the ever-changing context that central banks face and be ready to identify threats, vulnerabilities, as well as their interconnections, to be better prepared to prevent and to preemptively address these risks and mitigate their impact.", "Hence the importance of having working groups and foster collaborative spaces where central banks can exchange their experiences, provide relevant information to identify trends, and propose solutions to the new challenges they face.", "Since its foundation in 2006, the International Operational Risk Working Group (IORWG) has facilitated spaces for close cooperation and coordination within the central banking community, continually strengthening and providing opportunities for our respective institutions, in order to share their best practices, implementation experiences, and novel proposals, to address the issues that emerge in this dynamic, evolving and challenging risk environment.", "For us, at Banco de Me\u0301xico, it is a privilege to be part of the International Operational Risk Working Group (IORWG) and I am sure that during these three days of work, in this space and platform, countless ideas and strategies will arise that will allow us to expand our vision to successfully address the challenges that we are all facing.", "Once again, I welcome you all to Banco de Me\u0301xico and I thank you in advance for your valuable contributions to these topics of interest to all of us."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Operational risk management", "Cybersecurity risks", "Business continuity", "Risk culture", "Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)", "Vendor risk management", "Maturity models", "Risk appetite", "Resilience", "Third-party risk"]}
