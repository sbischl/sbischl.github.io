{"sentences": ["As you are aware, economic activity in Japan continues to be virtually flat.", "Recently, however, some signs of apparent recovery are being observed.", "Business fixed investment is recovering gradually against the background of an upturn in corporate performance--a trend evident particularly among large manufacturers.", "As for the export environment, the likelihood is gradually increasing that the growth rate of the U.S. economy will accelerate and that the East Asian economies as a whole will resume a growth trend.", "Furthermore, business and household sentiment is getting a boost from the substantial rise in stock prices from their low levels during the early spring.", "Thus, it is likely that exports and production will gradually resume an upward trend, triggering a virtuous circle leading to a moderate self-sustained recovery in domestic demand.", "The extent and strength of recovery based on this scenario of export and production growth need to be monitored closely, as they could be affected adversely by ongoing structural adjustments, such as firms' reduction of excess debts and labor costs.", "With regard to financial markets, long-term interest rates are increasing along with the rise in stock prices.", "Long-term rates normally move in response to market participants' prospects for the economy.", "In the short term, however, they may move

explained, the Bank's commitment to easy monetary policy is unequivocal.", "However, the role of financial markets in delivering its commitment effect through the entire economy is equally great and not to be discounted.", "A key factor behind their role, I believe, is the \"price discovery function.\"", "In other words, the determination of market prices and interest rates at levels that reflect the degree of relevant risks is the most important premise for the efficient distribution of funds required by firms and households.", "Further refinement of the price discovery function through development of innovative transactional techniques in an environment of enhanced market liquidity should lead to more efficient funds allocation and, hopefully, more active investment by the private sector.", "In this connection, markets for new securitization products such as asset-backed securities (ABSs) have grown in recent years.", "I strongly hope that securities firms, the main players in the securities market, and other relevant institutions will continue to utilize their ingenuity in developing new and innovative financial instruments that will further invigorate financial markets.", "The Bank, for its part, has recently started purchasing ABSs to help support this market.", "It is unprecedented for a central bank to directly accept the credit risk pertaining to private-sector
