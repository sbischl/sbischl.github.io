greater capital account liberalisation.", "So what should India do or how should it proceed further on this path?", "The first obvious question has to be why does India need capital account convertibility when empirical evidence regarding its impact on growth is mostly negative?", "The indirect effect, as argued by some researchers, is also not well established.", "The answer, to my mind, lies in fact that greater opening of capital account is inescapable as the Indian economy grows further and becomes global in dimension.", "A truly globalised economy, which the Indian economy is likely to become in the not too distant a future, cannot afford to remain isolated for a very long period of time.", "Sooner than later, it will need to get closely integrated with the rest of the world.", "While there are risks associated with full capital account convertibility, resisting liberalisation over an extended period may prove futile and counterproductive.", "As the economy gets more globalised, it will become harder to maintain closed capital accounts.", "Increasing openness to international trade may create opportunities for circumvention of capital account restrictions

methods which corporates may employ to get around capital account restrictions.", "In any case, keeping any restriction for too long is self defeating as people end up finding new methods of bypassing that restriction.", "So, India needs to continue moving towards full capital account convertibility.", "There is simply no escape from it.", "It is a moot question as to how fast the movement should be.", "That will depend on how fast we can meet the most important preconditions like fiscal consolidation, inflation control, low level of NPAs, low and sustainable current account deficit, strengthening of financial markets, prudential supervision of financial institutions, etc.", "India has already made visible progress on these fronts.", "There are of course risks, but we need to accept these risks and move forward boldly while controlling the risks as far as practicable.", "If the experience of developed countries is any pointer, sound policies, robust regulatory framework
