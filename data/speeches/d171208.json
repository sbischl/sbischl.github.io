Copeland for the US.", "The picture above, which has a nice vintage feel to it, summarises his idea of the economy as a money circuit, showing the connections between the institutional sectors.", "In 1955 the Federal Reserve published its first version of the annual flow of funds.", "Italy's first financial accounts appeared about ten years later, in the Annual Report of the Banca d'Italia for the year 1964.", "We were among the first countries for which financial accounts became available.", "Of course, the pioneering work at the Fed was an inspiration, but there had been some significant preparatory work here as well.", "Since the 1940s Paolo Baffi, who was to become Governor many years later (1975-79), had been working on reconstructing the financial statements of the institutional sectors.", "He was influenced by Giorgio Mortara, an eminent statistician and his teacher, and by Wesley Mitchell, whose work on business cycles he had translated.", "They used to tell a story here at the Bank of Italy about how Baffi visited the Federal Reserve Board in the mid-1950s, as Head of Research, to discuss the construction of financial accounts.", "Proof that this was no myth was recently discovered in our historical archives in the form of several letters (one is pictured below) exchanged between William McChesney Martin, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1951 to 1970, and Donato Menichella, Governor of the Bank of Italy from 1950 to 1960.", "Baffi stayed at the Fed for a few months in 1956.", "In the 1960s other countries - the UK and Germany among them - began to publish national financial accounts on a regular basis.", "These accounts became part of a triad that also included non-financial national accounts and input-output tables.", "Real national accounts had begun to be compiled following the Keynesian revolution, as the invention of macroeconomics and the definition of the attending concepts (income, consumption, investment, savings) prompted the development of statistical methods to produce a reasonable approximation of the real-world counterparts to those concepts.", "The first release of the United Nations' Systems of National Accounts came in 1947.", "Once the statistical foundations for real national accounts had been laid, moving on to financial accounts seemed natural.", "As we were soon to learn, this was no easy task.", "Even more, making the two sets of macro accounts consistent, i.e.", "integrated - a logical and easy step in theory - was in fact very difficult in practice.", "The effort to understand and possibly control business cycles after the devastation of the Great Depression was itself a powerful driving force for the development of financial accounts.", "Financial variables such as bank loans and deposits, bonds and shares, arranged within a consistent framework, were seen as necessary to get a full picture of the cyclical factors in the economy.", "The availability of information on financial flows may also have been regarded in those days as instrumental to economic planning; in some Western countries this was considered a very important and effective tool of economic policy in the post-war period.", "With illusions of top-down planning long forgotten in many market economies, this point is easily overlooked nowadays, but it was surely another significant factor in those times.", "There was a golden age of financial accounts between the 1960s and the early 1970s.", "James Tobin, among others, used them to look at the way agents allocate wealth across financial and non-financial assets; in his Nobel Memorial Lecture in 1981, he discussed 'Money and finance in the macro-economic process' using flow-of-fund tables.", "Tobin and others had built models based on the interaction between the real and the financial sectors.", "This idea was taken up by central banks.", "For instance, the 1986 version of the Bank of Italy Quarterly Econometric Model contained a complete description of the links between saving, non-financial investments and financial flows.", "Financial accounts were also a rather popular subject for research.", "Surveys of the literature list around 250 works on flows of funds published in twenty years or so after Copeland's book.", "Interest in financial accounts declined in the 1980s, only to pick up again after the crisis.", "Many factors were at play: a growing focus on the micro foundations of macroeconomics; an increasing concentration on inflation as a target, and on money and credit aggregates as instruments, for monetary policy; some neglect of interconnections across the financial system; and much trust (too much, one would say in retrospect) in the self-correcting mechanism of price adjustments, which implied less interest in the quantities (flows and stocks) that make up financial accounts.", "On the statistical front, the main effort then was directed at fuller international harmonisation of real statistics, which resulted in the 1993 System of National Accounts; at the same time, as I mentioned earlier, integrating real and financial accounts was proving elusive.", "Financial accounts continued to be used, though to a lesser extent, by economists such as Wynne Godley and Raymond Goldsmith.", "Then the Asian crisis of the late 1990s showed the importance of sectoral financial connections and the need to study the balance sheets of banks, firms, and households.", "Since the start of monetary union, the ECB's monetary analytical framework has included financial accounts as a tool for cross-checking its 'first pillar' (economic analysis) against its 'second pillar' (monetary analysis).", "However, it was the global financial crisis that generated renewed interest.", "A lesson of the crisis was that tracking sectoral imbalances was important; that an excessive level of debt may cause vulnerabilities; and that therefore the pursuit of financial stability required monitoring the level of corporate and household debt and the leverage of financial institutions.", "Finance was no longer a mere veil.", "In 2011 the European Union adopted a surveillance procedure to monitor and correct macroeconomic imbalances.", "Among the indicators used are three key elements of the financial accounts: the stock and the flow of private sector debt and the change in the financial sector's liabilities.", "Finally, the importance of the interactions between the real economy and the financial sector for econometric modelling is now well-recognised and efforts are being made to integrate macro-financial relationships for key sectors such as non-financial corporations and households into large macro models.", "Godley constantly followed the idea that economic models should be founded on flows and stocks, and developed consistent models of the US economy and the economies of other countries (see Godley, W. and M. Lavoie, 2007, Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Money, Credit, Income, Production and Wealth, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke).", "Goldsmith dedicated his research programme to the building of national and sector balance sheets, exploiting the financial accounts time series.", "See Goldsmith R.
