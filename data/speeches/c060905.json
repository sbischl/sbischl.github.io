objective of stabilising developments in output and employment.", "Flexible inflation targeting builds a bridge between the long-term objective of monetary policy, which is to keep inflation on target and provide an anchor for inflation expectations, and the more short-term objective of stability in the real economy.", "Low inflation in recent years is both the result of monetary policy assessments and unforeseen disturbances to the economy.", "Towards the end of 2002, Norges Bank shifted its monetary stance in an accommodative direction as new information indicated that developments in output and unemployment might be weaker than projected and inflation might be lower than target.", "The key rate was reduced markedly in 2003 and The low interest rate level has contributed to a considerable

potential output.", "A substantial share of inward labour migration is accounted for by foreign companies with contracts in Norway.", "Labour inflows from the new EU member states still appear to be

industries.", "Oil prices are of importance for the activity level in the Norwegian economy and central government revenues.", "In recent years, oil prices have risen sharply.", "Crude oil prices rose

investment was close to NOK 87 billion, and it is expected to edge up again this year.", "The large Ormen Lange and Sn\u00f8hvit projects have contributed to high petroleum investment, and high oil

2007.", "Information from our regional network suggests that petroleum investment provides considerable impulses to activity in Norway's coastal regions.", "According to the network, suppliers to the petroleum sector are expecting strong growth to continue in the coming months.", "The level of investment is assumed to remain high next year, before declining somewhat the following year when Ormen Lange and Sn\u00f8hvit are scheduled for completion.", "No plans have so far been adopted for new projects of a similar size, but continued high oil prices are expected to contribute to high investment both in exploration and in fields in operation in the years ahead.", "There are prospects of strong growth in the Government Pension Fund-Global.", "Given our assumption for oil price developments ahead (oil futures), spending in line with the expected real return on the Fund implies that the structural, non-oil deficit may increase by close to NOK 15 billion at 2006 prices in both 2008 and 2009.", "With a period of strong expansion in the Norwegian economy, somewhat lower petroleum revenue spending will be in line with the fiscal rule.", "Our projections are based on the

does not imply considerable changes in the krone exchange rate.", "Growth in disposable income has been high in recent years.", "Lower interest expenses as a result of the decrease in interest rates

employment and falling unemployment, consumption growth is expected to be high again this year.", "Since the publication of the June Inflation Report, electricity prices have increased to a further extent than expected.", "Forward prices for next winter have also increased.", "Higher electricity prices may in isolation reduce household purchasing power somewhat.", "On the other hand, growth in household income is high and there are market expectations of a fall in electricity prices later next year.", "A continued rise in house prices may contribute to holding up consumption growth.",

highest since the beginning of the 1980s.", "As the interest rate level gradually normalises, household interest expenses will increase.", "Combined with projected lower employment growth and higher

expected to result in lower consumption growth ahead.", "A gradual increase in the interest rate will probably curb activity in the housing market.", "Housing investment is expected to grow through

inflation is expected to slow.", "Household indebtedness has increased in tandem with high activity in the housing market.", "Growth in household debt (C2) has abated somewhat in recent months, but remains at a high level.", "Higher interest rates and lower house price inflation will gradually reduce household debt growth in the next few years.", "Growth in credit to mainland enterprises has also shown a sharp increase over the past year, partly reflecting increased fixed investment.", "With prospects of continued high capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy, solid profitability, ample liquidity and a high level of optimism among enterprises, strong growth in investment is expected again this year.", "As economic growth gradually slows, investment growth is also expected to moderate.", "Monetary policy assessments and strategy Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent Inflation Report steps - towards a more normal level.", "According to the monetary policy strategy in 2/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 23\u20444 - 33\u20444 per cent in the period to the publication of Inflation Report the next on 1 November, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections.", "In the first six months of 2006, the key rate was increased twice by increments of 0.25 percentage point.", "There are prospects that the interest rate will rise further at about the same pace.", "In line with this strategy, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.00 per cent at its meeting on 16 August.", "Capacity constraints and a shortage of skilled labour were cited as mounting challenges to a number of industries.", "At the same time, corporate earnings are very high.", "Local government tax revenues have increased substantially.", "Household and corporate borrowing remains high.", "Property prices are rising markedly, and the level of building activity is high.", "Growth among our trading partners is solid, and a number of countries have raised their policy rates.", "These factors point to a higher interest rate.", "At the same time, inflationary pressures, with the exception of energy prices, in the Norwegian economy remain fairly moderate.", "The krone exchange rate has depreciated recently, but over a period of several quarters the krone has varied around fairly strong levels.", "Exchange rate movements are difficult to project.", "The path for domestic and external interest rate does not imply any considerable changes in the krone exchange rate.", "Moreover, the Executive Board pointed out that the objective of bringing inflation back towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations implies a continued expansionary monetary policy.", "It is likely that continued high growth in output and employment will result in a gradual pick-up in inflation.", "The interest rate will therefore be set so that monetary policy gradually becomes less expansionary.", "The uncertainty surrounding the interest rate forecasts is illustrated in the fan chart and indicates that monetary policy reacts to disturbances to the economy.", "This contributes to increasing the uncertainty surrounding future interest rates, but at the same time contributes to stabilising economic developments.", "Monetary policy cannot fine-tune economic developments, but it can prevent the largest effects from occurring when the economy is exposed to disturbances.", "In some situations, it may be appropriate to hedge against particularly unfavourable developments.", "In the baseline scenario, the interest rate is gradually raised to a more normal level.", "Norges Bank continuously assesses the effects of interest rate changes and other new information concerning economic developments.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none",
