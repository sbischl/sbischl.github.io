Mark Twain puts it, \"history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme\".", "So despite the differences in the context and details of both the Asian and the European crises, the underlying root causes

story of mispricing occurred when some peripheral nations were able to access financing at a much cheaper rate than the country's underlying credit rating would have allowed them to do so - and this was made possible out of sheer membership of the Euro zone.", "A single currency and a convergence in risk rating, like our fixed exchange rate, gave the market a false sense of security that

in the absence of fiscal, and banking union.", "On the whole, these countries were victims of their own success.", "The \"reckless optimism\" prior to both episodes of crisis had ultimately led the countries to face similar consequences of severe market stress and capital flight, albeit with different symptoms: for Asia, losses incurred in the private sector's balance sheet, for Europe, public

flexibility.", "The devaluation of the exchange rate helped restore export competitiveness of the Asian economies.", "However, this freedom of flexibility might not be practical for Europe given its single currency setting and political complexities.", "The second is the supportive global economy, which provided the necessary market for Asia and allowed Asia to export our way out of the crisis.",

financial crisis.", "I would like to offer three reflections that may not necessarily pertain to Europe but may provide food for thought for policymakers.", "First, conventional policy prescriptions may not be appropriate for unusual circumstances and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.", "Asia was a case in point of ill-timed austerity measures.", "Public sector debt in Thailand then was less than 15% of GDP; yet the policy prescription for Thailand was to tighten fiscal policy and maintain tight monetary policy, resulting in (interbank) interest rate rising from 10% at the beginning of 1997 to over 20% at the end of 1997.", "With large private external debt beyond the ability of the country to service, a way out should have been debt restructuring with international creditors to give the country a breathing space and avoid the painful shock from the sharp reversal in capital.", "This was made possible only in the case of Korea which has helped the country recover from the crisis and was able to bring down interest rate much faster than other crisis countries.", "The case of Indonesia further led the IMF to reform towards more careful and focused policy prescription.", "The abrupt close-down of Indonesian commercial banks under the IMF program added to a sense of panic, which led to a broad-based bank run.", "Moreover, the conditionalities did not focus on the more critical macroeconomic adjustments which were directly related to the problems of the crisis but also included unrelated changes such as requirement to abolish import restrictions on all new and used ships.", "Secondly, policymakers must be ready to take away the punch bowl.", "In the past we used to talk about monetary policy being on the alert to take away the punch bowl.", "This crisis has proven that public policy in general need to observe this principle as well.", "Fiscal policy must guard against falling into the populist trap.", "Financial supervisors also need to be vigilant and watch out for signs of excessive credit creation, and act pre-emptively for the cost of cleaning up the crisis far outweigh the brief euphoria and exuberance of the moment.", "Central bank must maintain independence and credibility in order to voice and conduct appropriate policies that may not be favored politically.", "Going forward, I view that there is a need for international institution that oversees all finance-related conducts to ensure strict compliance of rule, implementation of ethical codes and avoid double standard across nations.", "Lastly, continuous and collective reforms are vital.", "Crisis is a recurring phenomenon and no lessons from previous crisis will ever fully prevent the next one.", "But through the process of reform after each crisis, the market grows and becomes more efficient.", "Crises provide a window or \"political feasibility\" to undertake needed structural changes that may be hard to sell to the public in normal circumstances, so one should not waste a good crisis.", "I am pleased to see numerous improvements in key areas of finance and supervision such as the use of macroprudential measures to complement traditional monetary policy tools.", "It is also more acceptable to require banks to provision in good times against losses in bad times, for after all most bad loans are made in good times.", "In addition to structural reforms, change in \"mindset\" is probably the most important.", "In order to keep up with the dynamic global environment, we may need to challenge and correct some of our old beliefs.", "Let me name a few - 1) sovereign is no longer risk-free, 2) we are taught to value economies of scale but are now confronted with the too-big-to-exist problem and 3) banks should no longer be only international in life but also in death as crises are more and more systemic given the growing interconnectedness.", "Spillover and contagion were witnessed in 1997 where the turbulence spread from Thailand to South East Asia and to Russia, China and Brazil, as it was a decade later in 2007 where the crisis widened from US and EU to the rest of the world.", "Imagine the pace of the spread of crisis in the next 10 years in 2017 - where crises would grow in size and speed beyond the management capacity of a single nation, real collective action is called for.", "Most importantly, we have to be forward-looking and well prepared.", "As crises are prone to occur more frequently with larger spillover, reform must be continued during normal times.", "It is imperative that the public is on board and support the reform effort to raise the competitiveness of the country, and minimize vulnerabilities or imbalances that may be triggered by external factors through no fault of their own.",

package some two years ahead of the schedule.", "Today, four years after the Lehman crisis, more work remains ahead of us.", "At this critical juncture, it might come down to policy action, which entails clarity, commitment and credibility, to progress onwards.", "Indeed, there are always benefits from looking back to the do's and don'ts in the rear mirror but it is of greater importance to be
