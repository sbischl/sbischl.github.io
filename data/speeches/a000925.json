probably of greatest significance at the moment - the recent tax reform.", "It is up to market organisers and market players to create efficient market structures and offer products that hold out the promise of sustained profits within the given statutory framework in line with the pursuit of their individual business.", "Instances of this are the emergence of new stock markets and stock market segments, and the creation of a large number of derivative instruments.", "Following the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bundesbank is now an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).", "The Bundesbank participates in the performance of the ESCB's tasks with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and arranges for the execution of domestic and international payments.", "Price stability and a functionally viable financial market structure are the preconditions which permanently have to be ensured so that there can be efficiency in financial transactions.", "In turn, efficient financial markets are the indispensable medium for a predictable and rapid transmission of monetary policy measures.", "Seen in that light, monetary policy and efficient financial markets are in a symbiotic relationship.", "Although the Bundesbank cannot, on regulatory grounds, take on the role of moderator - or even promoter - for the financial centre that some market players would like, it is, in fact, always ready to give active support as an advisor and initiator.", "The modernisation of German debt management or the customer-friendly ECB minimum reserve arrangements are illustrations of that.", "The fact that monetary policy has been transferred to the European Central Bank allows the Bundesbank to attend more than before to the continued strengthening of the competitiveness of the financial markets in Germany.", "A radical transformation is taking place in the financial sector, driven by the \"mega trends\" of globalisation, deregulation, innovation and the use of new technologies.", "In this connection, the trend has been strengthened by the introduction of the single currency in Europe.", "Securitisation was already one of the dominant trends in the early and mid-nineties.", "The adoption of the euro has now brought about a further surge in securitisation and given an additional boost to disintermediation.", "For the German credit institutions, the euro means that they no longer have the competitive advantage of the D-Mark, whereas for others it means that they no longer face the \"D-Mark home currency\" barrier to entering the market.", "Competition is becoming more and more intense within Europe and globally.", "Increasingly, credit institutions not only have to withstand growing competition from other banks but are also competing to a greater extent with insurance enterprises, investment and pension funds as well as online brokers -

as it is throughout the euro area.", "Lower government deficits - which are made possible by higher tax revenues, the auctioning of mobile telecommunications licences, privatisations as well as a consistent course of limiting expenditure, are creating scope for corporate financing through the bond market.", "Institutional investors appreciate the enhanced opportunities of portfolio diversification, which bring with them not only higher yields but also greater risks.", "There has been a clear improvement in the \"share culture\" in Germany over the past few years.", "Large, broadly spread issues, such as those of Telekom or of t-online, have played a part in that in the same way as the extremely successful development of the \"Neuer Markt\" as a new stock market segment for young high-growth enterprises.", "The frequent claim that German investors are risk-shy and prefer fixed-yield paper has been emphatically refuted over the past few years.", "The -

despite all the criticism of specific points - a tax reform has been initiated which deserves the name.", "The tax reform will bring about a crucial improvement in the conditions for economic activity in Germany.", "It will mean a considerable easing of the burden on enterprises and households and create planning certainty for the medium term.", "The fact that capital gains from sales of domestic participating interests are to be exempt from tax in the case of incorporated enterprises will make the - in some cases overdue restructuring of German groups much easier.", "With the lowering of corporate tax rates, Germany will in future occupy a competitive mid-table position in international terms.", "What is a problem, however, is that the reform will create further competitive distortions owing to retained profits being given preferential treatment over the distribution of dividends by incorporated enterprises, and other sources of taxable income.", "This will weaken the steering function of the capital markets.", "What will prove to be a particular drawback for the financial centre Frankfurt is the planned tax prohibition on offsetting losses arising from share derivatives against profits from the underlying shares.", "Here, a better solution should be found.", "Another justifiable point of criticism is the continued failure even to make a start on simplifying the highly complex German tax system.", "Tax consultancy is still going to be a growth industry in Germany.", "Despite all the satisfaction about tax relief measures, we should not overlook the fact that the tax burden will still be quite high in Germany, which means that Germany has to maintain a consistent course of fiscal consolidation.", "Excluding the receipts from the mobile telecommunications licences, the fiscal balance in 2000 will show only a slight improvement despite much higher tax revenues.", "In the coming year, the structural deficit will increase significantly.", "In other words: further reductions in expenditure are required in order to create scope for lower taxes.", "Maintaining and enhancing Germany's overall competitiveness - and certainly not just the competitiveness of its financial markets - is an ongoing task.", "International investors are looking to how Germany, as Europe's largest economy, copes with changed underlying conditions.", "Much has already occurred or been set in motion in Germany, such as the privatisation of former public enterprises together with market liberalisation and deregulation in such important areas as telecommunications and the post services, or price liberalisation in electricity.", "What still has to be done is the reorganisation of our social systems in line with foreseeable demographic developments.", "The basic features of the statutory pension scheme reform presented by the Federal Government would contribute to distributing the demographically induced burdens more equally between the present and future generations of pensioners, but consideration should continue to be given to raising the actual retirement age.", "The envisaged capital-backed supplementary pension would also place the funding of old-age provision on a broader foundation.", "What is also needed is to make our labour markets more flexible with the aim of reducing unemployment, which is still very high.", "That would also be an essential condition for bringing down non-wage labour costs - which are extremely high by international standards - in a systemically appropriate manner.", "Regrettably, the reforms that have already been implemented or are planned in Germany as well as in other European countries have received scant attention up to now outside of Europe.", "The markets obviously lean towards an asymmetrical view of things, with matching consequences for the external value of the euro.", "In conclusion, I would like to say a few words on our own behalf.", "The establishment of the ECB has created a new level of decision-making in the monetary policy of the countries in the euro area.", "The Bundesbank is now part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).", "This means that the Central Bank Council no longer has the power to decide monetary policy.", "What is necessary under the new conditions is to have a uniform management body located in Frankfurt.", "This would mean that the provision of Bundesbank services to the regions is not jeopardised.", "The independence of the ECB and of the national central banks within the ESCB is a key feature of European monetary policy.", "The \"denationalisation\" which this achieved was desired by all of member states and explicitly recognised by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which was unanimously approved by the second chamber of the German parliament representing the La\u0308nder or regions, the Bundesrat.", "Monetary policy can only be \"denationalised\", however, if national aspects no longer play a role in the assessment of monetary policy.", "That applies all the more to specific regional aspects.", "The Bundesbank is ready to adjust.", "During the past few weeks and months, the President of the Bundesbank has repeatedly pushed for the necessary measures of reform.", "As a member of the ECB Governing Council, he is aware of what kind of reforms are needed.", "That is not so in the case of proposals that have recently been put forward elsewhere, which, by contrast, appear to be short of the basic information about how the ESCB operates.", "Tackling the reform of the Bundesbank now with all speed and setting a clear course is something that undoubtedly requires political courage.", "The Bundesbank's ability to reform -
