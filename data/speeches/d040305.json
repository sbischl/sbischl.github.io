prevention is fundamental to avoiding a banking crisis.", "We all know that handling a crisis is always very difficult and painful; therefore, supervisors and bankers have a shared responsibility and accountability to prevent banking problems.", "Supervisors must create a sound framework, foster a robust and effective system, and establish clear procedures to identify and deal with weak banks.", "This means the supervisors must be equipped with the legal power to effectively carry out their duties and have the necessary tools, resources and capacity to solve the problems.", "These are the necessary infrastructure or building blocks of a sound and stable financial system.", "Equally important, the Board and management of individual banks must shoulder the responsibility of monitoring and addressing bank weaknesses.", "They cannot fail in their oversight and risk managerial duties, just as supervisors cannot fail in their on-site and off-site supervision.", "In this respect, I am a strong believer that good governance is the corner stone of a stable financial sector.", "We must create a banking community that does not tolerate imprudent business practices and lax systems and control.", "These are the sins of the past.", "Thailand, for instance, is carefully fostering a new business culture with the right values.", "On our part, the Bank of Thailand has since March 2002 announced guidelines supporting the practice of good corporate governance of banks' Board and management to ensure that they look after the interests of their stakeholders in an effective manner.", "These rules are not ground-breaking; they are just simple common sense.", "But we need to communicate clearly to the private sector what our expectations are and what the consequences are if the efforts fail.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, The cost of financial restructuring in Thailand was, after all, too enormous in figures and too painful in real terms to allow us to continue with our old way.", "In addition to changing the corporate culture, we are also amending a few key laws to solidify the foundation of our financial infrastructure.", "The new Financial Institutions Businesses Act will empower banking authorities with the necessary power to supervise financial institutions on a consolidated basis and to take appropriate actions against weak banks, with the provisions of prompt corrective actions.", "The Deposit Insurance Act will support a deposit insurance system to limit the loss of public money and reduce the moral hazard inherent in the current guarantee system.", "We must ensure that when a bank failure does occur, despite all preventive measures and utmost efforts to prevent it, depositors are taken care of fairly, and the bank's shareholders accept their due share of burdens.", "Moreover, we have drafted the Financial Sector Master Plan to foster an efficient, stable, and competitive financial sector, guiding the development of the financial sector over the medium term.", "All these initiatives were undertaken with the objective of providing the right framework for effective supervision in order to develop a sound and strong banking sector.", "In this regard, I trust that the discussions in the next two and a half days will be very constructive, providing more insights on these issues, as well as other controversial debates - such as the role of governments and lender of last resort.", "Allow me to say a few words on the substantial progress made by various international bodies in crisis prevention.", "The IMF has taken a leading role, revamping its own approach and sharpening its focus on crisis prevention, management, and resolution.", "Standards and codes of best practices have been introduced -

we don't have the same kind of crisis twice - and this indeed is a scary thought.", "We can come up with a how - to book on solving banking problems and crisis resolution, but the challenges are still enormous.", "I would like to reiterate the point made earlier that prevention is key because once a weak bank explodes into a full-blown crisis, the depth and complexity of problems could be of the magnitude that is unimaginable.", "It is with these thoughts in mind that I would have to sum up with this simple message: a supervisor can never be complacent.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Asian crisis started from Thailand slightly over six years ago, and it induced a train of international coordination programs and discussions to prevent a recurrence and means to manage it.", "I hope this conference will add to our knowledge of supervisory tools that can aid participating supervisors to better meet the challenges of weak bank resolution and systemic crisis regardless of the stages of economic development and forms of financial system.", "I am happy that Thailand is the venue of, and is host to, this conference -
