\uf0a7 A recent OECD document (De Crescenzio et al., 2015) emphasizes that mainly countries facing the \"original sin\" use CBM.", "Chile is one of them.", "This issue is important because measures of the \"original sin\" come from Panizza's work, who will be part of the panel (Eichengreen et al., 2002; Hausmann and Panizza, 2003).", "\uf0a7 Based on the previous point, it is worth clarifying what kind of CBM are in place in Chile.", "In addition, does the fact that in Chile almost all-international bond issuing is in foreign currency represents a constraint/vulnerability for the local financial system?", "- Financial literacy and educational programs to support better decisions at the household level.", "Background In Chile, the current approach to deal with potential vulnerabilities associated to volatile capital flows can be seen as orthodox, as we rely heavily on the importance of a flexible exchange rate regime and capital account openness, in conjunction with a consistent monetary and fiscal policy framework, and a sound banking regulation and supervision.", "However, it is important to remind to the public that we have come a long way.", "In fact, nearly 40 years ago, Chile faced one of the world's costlier financial crises precisely because the lack of several of these elements.", "In particular, FX exposures at a heavily leveraged and unsupervised banking sector contributed to the spread of the banking crisis after the fixed exchange rate regime collapsed in the early 1980s.", "As a result of this experience, banking regulation and supervision was substantially upgraded.", "In 1986, the General Banking Law introduced limitations on currency mismatch, constraints on related party lending, and restrictions for banks to receive goods instead of liquid resources; all of them, elements that were common practice before the 1982 crisis.", "Paradoxically, what could be considered harsher regulation did not hamper financial deepening.", "Instead, it fostered solvency and credibility of the banking system and allowed its healthy development in the ensuing decades.", "At the core of this development was the creation of a funded pension system, and subsequent capital market reforms, together with capital market openness, which dramatically changed the size, composition, depth, and strength of the financial sector in Chile.", "Now, during the transition toward fully implementing the current policy framework, Chile experienced a period of capital control that have been highly reviewed in the literature.", "The unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) implemented in Chile during the 1990s helped to change the composition of capital flows toward longer terms but was less effective in terms of reducing the aggregate level of capital flowing into the country.", "After removing the URR completely by the end of the 90s and allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate freely, the banking and corporate sector learned to operate in a completely different environment, characterized by an extensive used of the derivative market.", "In In particular, corporations have learned to operate in a flexible FX environment by using both, natural and market-based FX risk hedging instruments.", "This development has been supported by the development of the derivatives market, in which Pension Funds have been key counterparts as well.", "Banking regulation, in turn, have result in limited currency mismatches at the bank level, which have made the introduction of new regulation to deal with FX risk unnecessary, as we have observed in many emerging market economies after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).", "While may be true that other emerging economies have been increasingly active in the implementation of CBM in their banking systems, in Chile, we have followed a different approach to deal with FX risk at the banking level.", "This approach has been mainly characterized by limiting banks' direct FX-currency exposure (limited currency mismatches) as part of our overall capital requirements for market risk purposes.", "Also, by acknowledging the potential indirect FX risk through the credit provisioning requirements.", "In fact, in Chile, the main regulatory changes introduced has been the recent modification of the General Banking Law (GBL), which constitutes a major step forward for the local banking industry, in that it will contribute to reducing the gap with international regulatory standards established under Basel III.", "The new regulatory framework raises important challenges for the industry in terms of compliance with the new, more demanding solvency requirements, especially for entities with a smaller capital cushion.", "High-level Policy Seminar on Integration or

rather than the general resident-non-resident relationship, as is usually done by capital controls.", "The Figure below, for example, based on De Crescenzio et al.", "(2015), shows that EMEs countries exposed to the original sin (unable to borrow internationally in local currency) appear as tightening CBMs on banks' liabilities during the 2013-2015 period.", "Our understanding is that the databases used in cross-country analysis still contain a high degree of self-judgement by reporting countries that sometimes affect the quality and consistency of the information provided.", "At least this is

constitutional law.", "In Chile, we are under the process of simplifying our FX regulation, as well as improving our Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs), including the FX dimension to them.", "Thus, the Central Bank of Chile is currently working to allow the clearing of USD denominated large-value payments through its Real Time Gross Settlement payment system.", "Also, it is developing a Trade Repository for OTC derivatives, and it is about to issue the regulation for FX clearinghouses.", "Finally, the onboarding of the Chilean Peso into the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) System is a priority for the Central Bank of Chile.", "These measures may contribute to increasing the likelihood of issuance of local currency bonds overseas.", "Now, let me address some of the concern raised regarding new vulnerabilities, in particular at the non-banking sector.", "A reasonable concern is to what extent the low level of FX-risk at the banking sector in Chile have pushed for higher FX-risk in the non-banking sector?", "Our assessment is that the rising vulnerabilities observed in the nonbanking sector can be associated to the stronger bank regulation, but it does not correspond to the evolution of FX risk.", "In fact, the evolution of the non-banking sector reflects mainly issues of information asymmetries and the fact that some of these institutions can take advantage of payroll direct charges to enhance their consumer credit business.", "While non-bank lenders (NBL) provide commercial loans, their main business is to lend to households in the form of consumer and mortgage loans.", "In the consumer portfolio, NBLs include retailers, family compensation funds (CCAF), savings and loan associations (S&Ls), factoring and leasing companies (F&Ls), and car dealerships.", "The mortgage portfolio includes endorsable mortgage loans (\"mutuos hipotecarios\") issued by banks and mutual societies included among the assets held by life insurance companies (LICs).", "Finally, factoring and leasing companies mainly provide trade credit to businesses.", "Therefore most, if not all, of the lending activities of this sector is done in local currency.", "Having said that, we monitor this sector carefully, since the household debt issued by NBLs has increased a share of total consumer debt.", "Nonbank loans had a real annual growth rate of 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018.", "In the same period, bank consumer loans grew around 5.7%.", "Nonbank consumer loans together were equivalent to about 58% of total bank consumer loans.", "This rate has been stable since 2012, although the composition has changed.", "Specifically, the share of retailers has been steadily increasing since mid-2013, while the share of companies oriented toward car financing has expanded more recently.", "High-level Policy Seminar on Integration or Fragmentation?", "International Capital Flows in the Post-crisis World, September 2019 CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE

vulnerability, given that most of these lenders are outside the consolidated debt perimeter.", "In terms of arrears in the nonbank consumer portfolio, retailers recorded a slight improvement relative to end-2018, to 3.8%.", "In contrast, for the CCAFs, delinquency has increased steadily since 2013-when they began to use accounting criteria more similar to the banks-and it is currently more than double the rates for the rest of the nonbank consumer lenders.", "Moreover, the banking sector has significant exposure to the NBLs, through commercial loans to these institutions.", "In particular, loans to this segment have increased among medium-sized banks in recent years.", "Thus, the exposure-to NBL debt-of the large and medium-sized banks, as of February 2019, represented 12.7 and 27.2% of their regulatory capital, respectively.", "The profitability of the NBLs, measured through ROA, has been relatively stable, standing at 4.6% at year-end 2018 for retailers; 3.8% for S&Ls; and 2.6% for
