and possible bust - in the household sector's main asset class.", "On the most recent readings, there has been a distinct softening in most of the major housing markets, with more than one data series showing an outright fall in prices in the March quarter in several cities.", "This was associated with a decline in the demand for credit, though on the most recent data that demand still seems very strong.", "House prices in Brisbane and the Gold Coast declined a little on these measures, though not by as much as those further south.", "While various fundamental reasons can be advanced for dwelling prices to have risen noticeably in the 1990s, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that strong speculative forces were at work over the past couple of years.", "That was not a healthy state of affairs and the sooner it passed, the better.", "It is just about impossible, of course, to predict with any precision how all of this will unfold from here.", "Much will depend on what else is occurring in the economy.", "In individual cases, the extent of leverage will be very important.", "My own view is that the palpable sense of disappointment being felt by many leveraged investors in residential property is likely to grow further for the next year or so, possibly longer.", "For many owner-occupiers, on the other hand, a moderate decline in prices should not create major discomfort, in an environment of ongoing growth in employment and wages, as well as reduced taxes.", "In fact, it is hard to imagine a much more benign backdrop for the aftermath of an asset and credit boom than one where growth in employment and income is continuing, the world economy is picking up and the Australian economy is relatively free of other domestic imbalances.", "Even so, we anticipate that housing market developments will be a factor at work in reducing the rapid pace of growth in domestic spending to something more moderate.", "Rising house prices and the capacity to collateralise the higher wealth has accommodated a rise in consumption which has consistently outpaced the rise in income over several years.", "In a world where dwelling prices have stopped rising and even declined somewhat, perceptions of ongoing rapid increases in wealth are presumably now in the process of dissipating.", "This will weaken positive wealth effects, and could possibly lead to a partial reversal in time.", "On the other hand, the earlier increases in dwelling prices were very large, and even with the latest data showing declines, a big cumulative rise in wealth has occurred over the past decade, most of which has not been tapped.", "So there may yet be some expansionary impetus in the pipeline from those earlier gains.", "Consumption, Wealth and Income* % % Ratio of wealth to income 550 550 Year-ended percentage change 6 6 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 * Disposable income net of depreciation Sources: ABS; RBA The net effect is therefore hard to judge, but on balance, we are inclined to think that consumer demand will grow more in line with income over the next year or two -
