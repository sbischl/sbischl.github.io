and the need to ensure that headway in financial inclusion does not impair consumer safeguards or financial stability.", "I would like to offer some brief thoughts on each of these two points.", "Promoting the use and development of new technologies.", "Logically, developing technological solutions requires suitable telecommunications infrastructures.", "They must provide widespread access to the Internet, including in rural areas, while seeking to improve digital education and offer safeguards against vulnerabilities such as cyber threats.", "We should not forget that approximately two-thirds of the adult population without access to banks do have a mobile phone.", "And, as the World Bank points out, these devices are proving essential for improving accessibility to financial services.", "Moreover, the development of a stable institutional framework - paving the way for competition, providing legal security to the new financial proposals and ensuring an appropriate level of interoperability - is vital for generating the necessary confidence in financial services.", "Also, aspects such as legal recognition of digital identification, the use of biometrics in identification and ease of access to public data in \"Know your costumer\" (KYC) procedures, are matters the different tiers of government can push and which catalyse significantly the progress in financial inclusion.", "Monitoring the risks inherent in financial innovation.", "Along with the aforementioned risks linked to cyber threats, financial innovation, in particular that aimed at the most vulnerable population segments, can cause situations of over-indebtedness, market abuse and fraud.", "This process must then be accompanied by financial education actions, the strengthening of consumer safeguard measures and the development of data privacy policies.", "But we should not lose sight of the speed at which these innovations develop.", "Such speed poses difficulties for setting regulations in place since, on many occasions, their implementation can only come about when the use of certain practices has become widespread on the market.", "Hence, the use of formulas such as sandboxes or innovation hubs may help the regulators act more nimbly while creating an environment in which innovators can better anticipate regulatory trends.", "Lastly, and before giving way to the panellists, the true protagonists of this debate, I would mention the importance of international coordination and cooperation.", "Many of the challenges surrounding financial inclusion and the use of new technologies are common to all countries.", "This is why the role of organisations such as the IMF, with the Bali declaration, and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, with the Maya declaration, is pivotal to boosting the use of new technologies in this field.", "We should also not forget the role that global companies such as the bigtech can play.", "Indeed, financial inclusion is one of the essential elements highlighted by Facebook in its proposal for a global means of payment, its socalled Libra.", "In view of such initiatives, with a worldwide and immediate scope, you will agree with me that international coordination is not an option but an obligation."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Financial inclusion", "Digitalization", "Payments", "Technology", "Financial services", "Access to finance", "Intermediation markets", "Consumer safeguards", "Financial innovation", "International coordination"]}
