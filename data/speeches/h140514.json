credit at the World Bank.", "Paasikivi replied that Finland would indeed apply for membership in the IMF and the World Bank as soon as the peace treaty had been concluded.", "Paasikivi anticipated that, after signing the peace treaty, Finland would first enter the United Nations and only then apply for membership of the \"International Bank\" as the World Bank was called at the time.", "The marching order that Paasikivi proposed to Hamilton - first the peace treaty, then the UN, finally the IMF - became quickly obsolete, as it was decided that Italy could be accepted as a member of the organizations although its peace treaty had not been signed.", "Finland was then able to follow the precedence sat by Italy.", "Joining the IMF and the World Bank were economically appealing to Finland but fraught with political consequences.", "The dominant economic motivation at the time was to obtain dollar loans.", "Opting out of Marshall aid in the summer of 1947 intensified Finland's need for foreign currency in the form of credit.", "Politically the IMF and the World Bank also offered a way to bolster Finland's international standing.", "However, as the end of the 1940s approached, the Soviet Union grew ever more suspicious of the western orientation of these organizations and the United States' de facto leadership of them.", "Finland became the 46th member of the

decades after World War II.", "Membership of the IMF was one great step on the path the country chose in its international economic relations.", "The most tangible consequence of the IMF was the commitment to a process that made the Finnish markka externally convertible.", "Another part of the same package was membership of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), which meant a

but had a deep influence on the whole of Finnish society.", "A convertible currency and diminishing customs barriers gradually brought Finnish prices in line with international markets.", "The gradual deregulation of foreign trade initiated a major restructuring of Finnish industry and focused the nation's efforts on improving national productivity and competitiveness.", "Together with later steps

position as a country defeated in the war, its membership of the IMF came at a relatively early time.", "Neutral Sweden delayed its application for a long time and joined the Bretton Woods institutions a full three years after Finland.", "But they could afford being out better than Finland could.", "Finland joined the IMF while the fund still had relations with the Soviet bloc.", "The relations broke off by the end of the 1940's.", "Whether Soviet objections would have prevented Finland's membership if its application had been delayed is hypothetical, but cannot be ruled out.", "From the perspective of Finland's reputation in the world, and very much in the eyes of our Northern American friends, it was a definitive plus to be a member of club of market economies.", "Part of a country's reputation is based on your reference group, and for Finland, it was the IMF and the Nordic constituency.", "Let me now turn to my third and final theme, the European integration project.", "Again for reasons of foreign policy, Finland had to remain outside the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, which was founded to channel Marshall aid to the participating states in Europe.", "It was only 1in 1969 that Finland joined the OECD, the successor organization of the OEEC.", "Not receiving Marshall aid constituted a heavy economic loss for Finland.", "While for

the American administration explicitly wanted to promote cooperation between the former enemies in Europe.", "One should not underestimate the stimulus given by the US to the project of European integration.", "There were even secret funds from the American intelligence community that were channeled to different form of organizations working for European unity.", "In the late 1940s there really was a lot of integration projects that started without Finland taking part; for instance the projected European Customs Union, the Nordic Customs Union and the European Payments Union, to name but some examples.", "The official Finland did not react at all to the emergence of the Council of Europe.", "In the early 1950s the other Nordic countries established permanent delegations at the European Coal and Steel Community - the forerunner to the EEC - but for Finland this option was unthinkable.", "For the general position of Finland, Stalin's death in 1953 and the more responsive attitude of the regimes that followed, gave Finland more room for maneuver in our Western relations.", "In 1955 Finland became a member both of the Nordic Council and of the United Nations.", "The absence of Finland from the early phases of the economic and political integration in Europe made it even more important that the country had managed to become a member of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as of the GATT agreement.", "For Finland it was extremely important when it came to foreign trade policy that the export markets in the West remained open.", "Finnish industry competed with among other - and foremost - Swedish companies.", "During the whole period of the Cold War Finland was able to gain more or less the same benefits as the Swedes when it came to opening up of export markets.", "Finland also stayed on the same footing with Sweden through the EEC free trade agreement in the early 70s.", "The 1975 Helsinki summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - with both Canada and the US taking part - had in the long run the somehow unintended consequence that it helped to undermine the legitimacy of the Eastern bloc.", "In 1989 the new dynamic

Area.", "The Berlin wall came down the same year.", "For Finland it was important to safeguard its commercial interests.", "Finland joined the EEA negotiations, but the train was moving rapidly.",

first group of countries to join the monetary union.", "In my assessment, the decision was a good one.", "Finland has enjoyed unprecedented price and financial stability during its participation in the single currency.", "Even though the monetary union has been under severe strain due to the imbalances in some of the member countries, as we know, the Finnish money markets have been calm.", "Thanks to that, the negative impact of the \"Great Recession\" of the last years hit Finland mainly through export markets, and the financial conditions have remained supportive to growth.", "Finland has a serious structural challenge in our industry, but it not related to the financial crisis or economic and monetary union.", "The next step in Finland's participation in transatlantic economic integration is already under preparation.", "I am referring to the negotiations on a trade agreement between the EU and the US, under the rubric of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.", "As you will know, the negotiations were begun last summer.", "The agreement, if successfully completed, holds a great promise for boosting growth in an area which covers roughly a half of global economic output.", "For Finland, the key issues include enhanced market access in goods, services and public procurement; facilitation of customs procedures; and reduction of technical barriers to trade.", "There are several high tech industries in Finland which could benefit from lowering of transatlantic trade barriers.", "A central banker will pay special attention to banks and the rest of the financial services industry.", "It is not yet fully clear to what extent the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership will cover the financial services sector.", "It has been argued that the negotiations provide an opportunity for promoting regulatory convergence.", "That is an important goal.", "On the other hand, both the EU and the US are reluctant to surrender their autonomy in the area of prudential regulation.", "Also, effective regulatory coordination at the global level is already taking place at a less binding level at the BIS.", "The large economies of the world have all worked extremely hard over the last years to reform their banking regulation.", "One even speaks of a \"Regulatory Tsunami.\"", "I have myself been part of that effort by chairing the working group that proposed a reform of banking structures in the EU.", "Thinking about all the work that has been done in order to reform banking regulation on both sides of the Atlantic, it would be unfortunate
