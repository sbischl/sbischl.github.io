after all, one of the first jobs I was tasked with as a Bundesbank economist in Frankfurt was carrying out these kinds of liquidity needs estimates.", "Most of the time, the overnight rate for unsecured money market operations (EONIA) would be somewhere near the main refinancing rate.", "Every now and again, things would fluctuate more.", "The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility then functioned, in a sense, as the guard rails of the money market, forming a corridor within which the overnight rate moved.", "Then came the financial crisis, and the Eurosystem switched to full allotment at fixed rates.", "For a time, and in aggregate terms, banks were demanding more liquidity than they immediately needed.", "The Eurosystem subsequently kept offering refinancing operations with maturities of multiple years.", "Thanks to extremely favourable terms, these operations met with very brisk demand.", "The Eurosystem's later asset purchases at the lower bound then resulted in a great deal more excess liquidity on a scale that far exceeded that seen at the time of the financial or sovereign debt crisis.", "And that's why short-term interest rates in the euro area have, for some time now, been geared around the deposit rate.", "This is sometimes talked about as a de facto floor system.", "With monetary policy asset holdings starting to be scaled back, we find ourselves facing the question of which instruments should be used to steer short-term interest rates going forward.", "There has been some initial reflection on the matter in the Eurosystem already but no decisions have yet been made.", "First of all, price stability can, in principle, be assured in either set-up: both in a corridor system where central bank liquidity is scarce, and in a floor system with permanent excess reserves.", "What's clear is that the past crises have also brought about changes that are exerting a lasting impact - for example, where the regulation of banks is concerned.", "And the high level of excess liquidity provisioned by the Eurosystem under its asset purchase programmes often means banks have no need to turn to the interbank market.", "After many years where the banking system has been amply supplied with central bank liquidity, concerns exist.", "How might the financial system cope if excess liquidity were to be rapidly brought back down to far lower levels?", "With this is mind, there is no reason to rush into a decision and, say, necessarily head back to an old-style corridor system.", "In principle, a floor system would also be an option for a future operational framework.", "What matters, in my view, is that the framework lives up to the following two principles.", "First, the market should be given more space again.", "I have fundamental faith in the market mechanism's ability to channel resources to where they are utilised productively.", "Second, the central bank balance sheet should be run down to a much lower, reasonable level within an acceptable timeframe.", "Future monetary policy challenges may mean we need greater room for manoeuvre again.", "As I see it, there is therefore much to recommend a return to a far smaller central bank footprint in the market going forward.", "This would mean, in particular, a significantly smaller balance sheet total.", "The Bank for International Settlements' chief economist Claudio Borio recently cited yet another argument for favouring a lean central bank balance sheet: the smaller the balance sheet, the less exposed a central bank leaves itself to political pressure or criticism, e.g.", "with respect to its independence.", "For all these reasons, I am an advocate of significantly slimming down the Eurosystem's balance sheet over the years to come.", "The normalisation of monetary policy provides us with an opportunity to review the operational framework.", "That framework should be simple, efficient and as marketneutral as possible, whilst at the same time allowing a good handle on interest rates.", "The operational framework is the vehicle through which monetary policy signals are transmitted.", "At present, the monetary policy signals are clearly pointing toward further tightening.", "Inflation in the euro area may be receding but it is still too high.", "And the latest forecasts suggest that we cannot expect price stability to be restored in a timely manner.", "Inflation is proving to be more persistent than many thought.", "In response, monetary policy must now show itself to be more persistent and more resolute than many would have expected.", "Lagarde, C.
