without collaterals.", "Before CSF, financially-challenged entrepreneurs source funds from informal lenders at very high interest rates.", "CSF is also a positive for banks.", "Even without collaterals, bank loans made under CSF are effectively insured against default by the surety fund set up jointly by the LGUs and other partner organizations.", "You may ask, does it really work?", "Well, based on our experience from the first 11 CSFs it works!", "I will share some CSF updates with you: As of 31 July 2010, the eleven (11) CSFs set up ahead of Albay are in the Provinces of Aurora, Bohol, Cavite, Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental and North Cotabato as well as in the Cities of Cebu and Iloilo.", "The combined assets of

million at any one time.", "Total loans booked under the program reached P53 million.", "These loans not only helped end-user borrowers finance the needs of their businesses but helped their immediate communities as well.", "Loan applications amounting to P156 million are in various stages of processing and approval.", "Given these numbers, it is safe to say that CSFs have gained traction.", "For this, we thank our LGU partners, as well as our institutional partners that includes the Land Bank of the Philippines, the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund.", "We also acknowledge IGLF's support for the training of contributing cooperatives on credit appraisal and monitoring, basic accounting, marketing, and credit risk management.", "The University

will screen and evaluate the loan applications.", "In the case of Albay, we see a perfect fit with CSF.", "Based on our monitoring, loans to deposit ratio in the entire Bicol Region remains low.",

"Possibly, the guarantee provided by the credit surety fund for bank lending could well be the catalyst that will move lending forward here in Bicol.", "With the dynamic leadership provided by Governor Salceda and other Albay LGU officials, I am confident Albay Mayon CSF will serve as a positive catalyst that will further accelerate the development of the Bicol Region.", "As reported
