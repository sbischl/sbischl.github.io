stood at slightly below 1% for a while.", "This year the National Bank began publishing its inflation forecast once every quarter.", "Our inflation forecast of March 2003 (the dash-dotted green curve in the graph) shows that at that time we assumed, based on a stable three-month Libor rate of 0.25%, that inflation would gradually rise to 2.5% in the fourth quarter 2005.", "This inflation forecast

the next three years, average inflation should amount to 0.6% in 2003, drop to 0.4% in 2004 and climb to 1.2% in 2005.", "It is thus forecast to remain under 1% until mid-2005.", "In the course of 2005, however, an acceleration will get under way, with forecast inflation reaching the 2.5% mark in the second quarter of The new forecast is consistently below that of March 2003.", "The low inflation at the beginning of 2004 is attributable to a basis effect as a result of the development of oil prices.", "The lower inflation forecast for the period thereafter is due to the delayed economic upswing.", "According to the new forecast, inflation in 2006 is no longer in the range that the National Bank equates with price stability.", "It should be noted that these forecasts assume that monetary policy will remain expansive over the next three years.", "We can preempt such a rise in inflation by tightening monetary policy at a later time.", "Relaxed monetary policy Our interest rate cut of 50 basis points last March was the last possible downward interest rate adjustment.", "Our intention was to resolutely counter the appreciation of the Swiss franc vis-a\u0300-vis the euro

to remain unattractive in the foreseeable future.", "Economic recovery is still uncertain.", "There is even recurring talk of a deflation risk in Switzerland.", "We consider this to be a minimal risk.", "In a few months, inflation may well be negative.", "An actual deflation spiral leading to a strong decline in the demand for goods and in output is, however, highly unlikely as long as the Swiss franc does not appreciate inordinately.", "We shall therefore continue to take decisive steps to combat a tightening of the monetary conditions brought about by any significant rise of the Swiss franc against the euro.", "You will certainly have taken note of the high growth rates of the money supply aggregates in the last few quarters.", "The money supply aggregates are currently growing at rates last seen at the end of the eighties.", "The question arises to what extent this expansion in the money supply has an inflationary effect.", "First, let it be said that we are deliberately conducting an expansionary policy.", "That partly explains the above-average money supply growth.", "It also must be noted, however, that the painful experiences investors have made on the stock markets and the uncertain economic situation have significantly heightened the preference for liquidity.", "A look at credit statistics confirms that the money supply did not grow as a result of credit creation and therefore does not serve to finance any existing demand for goods.", "Moreover, our economy currently has free capacities so that increased demand will not immediately push up prices.", "We are therefore convinced that we have sufficient time at our disposal to keep inflation within the bounds of price stability by tightening monetary policy at a later point in time.", "I should like to emphasise once more that in the present situation other efforts are needed besides an expansionary monetary policy in order to maintain or to enhance the attractiveness of Switzerland as an industrial and business centre.", "Such efforts include a further liberalisation of the domestic economy, an increase in competitiveness in the structurally weak sectors, and sound public finances.", "Adjustment of the monetary policy concept of the ECB A few weeks ago, the European Central Bank (ECB) finalised a monetary policy assessment and slightly adjusted its monetary policy concept.", "In future, the ECB will no longer lay down the reference value for the money supply M3 every year but will keep it unchanged for longer periods of time.", "In communicating its monetary policy decisions, the ECB will, other than in the past, first comment the general price and economic development and only afterwards the development of the money supply.", "Furthermore, the ECB has confirmed its definition of price stability.", "It considers price stability to have been achieved when the inflation rate is below 2%.", "At the same time, the ECB has announced that it will now be aiming at an inflation rate of nearly 2% in the medium term.", "The National Bank defines price stability in the same way as the ECB.", "The question thus arises whether we, too, should as a principle aim at the upper level in the range of price stability.", "We see no reason to make any changes in our concept.", "Switzerland is a small open economy and the proportion of imported goods in the national consumer price index amounts to 25%.", "As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, the inflation rates are significantly more volatile than in the euro area.", "There is therefore no sense in aiming at an excessively narrow range of inflation.", "Such temporary fluctuations in inflation do not pose a problem for the Swiss economy and should not be countered by means of special monetary policy actions.", "Furthermore, the euro area also has the problem that there is a large spread in inflation between the peripheral countries and the countries at the centre.", "In striving for an inflation rate of less than, but close to, 2% in the medium term in the entire euro area, the ECB is trying to prevent inflation in the central countries from being pushed down towards zero, or even below zero, for any length of time.", "In Switzerland, this problem does not exist as only inflation measured in Switzerland is relevant for our monetary policy.", "Additional agreement between the Federal Department of Finance and the SNB on the distribution of profits on the free assets At yesterday's meeting the Bank Council of the National Bank agreed to an additional agreement between the Federal Department of Finance and the Swiss National Bank on the distribution of profits on the free assets (income on reinvested proceeds from gold sales).", "The profit distribution of the National Bank will thus increase by Sfr 300 million to a total of Sfr 2.8 billion (for the financial year 2003) in spring 2004.", "The National Bank's profit distribution has so far not taken account of this income on reinvested gold proceeds.", "On discussing this transaction, the bank authorities of the National Bank expressed their concern that it was now even more obvious that the National Bank's profit transfer was reaching a level that cannot be maintained in the long term.", "The Governing Board shares the bank authorities' concern that a later return to the \"normal level\", which will only amount to approximately Sfr 1 billion, is likely to create considerable political difficulties.", "From today's vantage point, it cannot be ruled out, moreover, that as a result of the additional distribution on the income-yielding free assets the National Bank's provisions will be reduced more rapidly than had been assumed when the main agreement on the National Bank's profit distribution was concluded in April 2002.", "At 2.9% a year, the income forecast on which this agreement was based is rather optimistic given the low yield level on the financial markets for some time to come.", "It may therefore well be that a downward adjustment will become necessary as early as 2007, when, in terms of the agreement, the level of distribution will be reconsidered.", "In any case, the National Bank does not consider an annual profit distribution of Sfr 3 billion from 2007 onward as by any means a certainty.", "We think it is important to draw attention to these risks well in time.", "We also explained them to the Head of the Federal Department of Finance and asked him to advise the responsible persons of the cantons of our misgivings."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary
