economy and high inflation, and we responded forcefully, increasing our policy interest rate rapidly.", "The year ahead will be different.", "In January, after eight consecutive interest rate increases, we said that we expect to hold the policy rate at its current level, conditional on the outlook for inflation.", "We are pausing to assess how well our interest rate increases are working to bring inflation down.", "With inflation above 6%, we are still a long way from the 2% target.", "But inflation is turning the corner.", "Monetary policy is working.", "That's what I'd like to talk about today-how, exactly, monetary policy works to I'll outline what we've done so control inflation.", "far, what the impact has been and what we expect going forward.", "I also want to talk about the risks and uncertainties that we are facing as we work to get inflation back to target.", "Canadians know inflation is high.", "They see it at the grocery store, when they pay their rent and when they go to a restaurant or on a trip.", "And they know that increased interest rates.", "They see that in higher costs for borrowing-in mortgage rates, lines of credit and business loans.", "But it is less obvious how higher interest rates are working to bring inflation Since March, we've raised the policy rate by down.", "41\u20444 percentage points.", "In recent months, inflation has levelled off and has begun to ease.", "The considerable tightening we've done will continue to work its way through the economy, and this will rebalance demand with supply and slow inflation.", "So how does this work?", "The transmission mechanism On the face of it, the Bank's approach to monetary policy is simple.", "We're an and that's about inflation-targeting central bank.", "We have a 2% inflation target, where inflation has been, on average, for 30 years-at least until the pandemic hit.", "When inflation strays from that target, we have one main tool to get it back to 2%-the policy interest rate.", "During times of crisis, we can use other tools, but usually we have one target and one tool.", "In practice, monetary policy is made more complicated by at least three realities.", "First, the influence of our policy interest rate on inflation is indirect.", "Second, it takes time to work-up to two years to have its full effect-and over that time, new developments will buffet the economy and inflation.", "Because monetary policy takes time, we have to try to look ahead to where inflation will be.", "And third, because we know new developments will always arise, we need to be humble about our forecasts and prepared to adjust to changing circumstances.", "Economists have a fancy name for the process through which changes in our \"the monetary policy transmission policy rate

1).", "Figure 1: The transmission mechanism of monetary policy When we raise the policy rate, it immediately costs more for banks to borrow from each other or from us.", "In response, they increase their rates for loans and deposits.", "That means that people get a higher return on their savings.", "But it also means they pay more interest on loans.", "Higher interest costs discourage people from borrowing.", "That might mean fewer people take out a mortgage to buy a home.", "They might delay buying a new car because the loan is more expensive.", "Or they might put off that kitchen renovation or family vacation.", "sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, like housing, are often the first to slow when we raise interest rates-it's direct channel.", "We also typically see demand for big-ticket items like cars and household appliances slow because people often borrow money to buy them.", "Higher rates also have knock-on effects further into the economy.", "Households with mortgages have less money to buy other things.", "Production slows down as demand weakens.", "Businesses may cut their investment plans because the cost of borrowing has gone up or demand has fallen off.", "Higher Canadian interest rates also make Canada more attractive to foreign investors.", "That means that, if everything else stays the same, the Canadian dollar will rise.", "This makes foreign goods less expensive for Canadians to buy, so the country imports less inflation.", "And it makes Canadian exports more expensive in foreign markets, slowing international demand for these goods and services.", "So higher policy rates mean lower demand at home and from abroad.", "And with less demand, growth in our economy slows.", "That doesn't sound like a good thing, but when the economy is overheated, it is.", "When demand runs ahead of supply, inflation faces upward pressure.", "Slowing the economy lets supply catch up with demand, and that relieves inflationary pressures.", "Monetary policy also influences expectations of future inflation.", "That's important because inflation today is also affected by what people think inflation is going to be in the future.", "If households and businesses think inflation is going to be low, businesses will be cautious about raising their prices out of fear that they will lose customers.", "And that keeps inflation low.", "But when consumers be high, businesses don't worry as much that higher prices will think inflation will scare off customers, so they are more inclined to raise them.", "That's why we have been so determined to keep inflation expectations well anchored at the 2% inflation target.", "We do that mostly through communication-by being crystal clear we are committed to restoring price stability-and by backing those words with action.", "To summarize, the Bank directly controls only the first step-the change in the policy rate.", "The other steps in the transmission mechanism are less direct, and they take time to have their full effect.", "Impact of higher policy rates so far When we began raising rates in March 2022, the economy was reopening after the fourth wave of the COVID-19 virus.", "As momentum built in the months that followed and the economy moved clearly into excess demand, we increased Russia's unprovoked attack of Ukraine in rates in unusually large steps.", "February also

rate have raised borrowing rates for households and businesses (Chart 1).", "The average five-year variable mortgage rate rose from 1.5% to 5.9% between January 2022 and January 2023, and the average

rapidly through 2022, the Canadian dollar did not appreciate against the US dollar.", "It did rise initially against other currencies-like the euro-until these jurisdictions also began forcefully raising their policy rates.", "This fight against inflation is a global one- we're not fighting it alone.", "After 11 months of policy rate increases, we're seeing signs that higher interest rates are beginning to rebalance the economy.", "Household spending has moderated, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors.", "The labour market remains tight, but early signs of easing are evident.", "Inflation has declined, and our surveys of inflation expectations suggest more businesses are convinced that inflation will recede.", "Let me talk about each of these impacts in turn.",

to have peaked around the middle of 2022 and has eased modestly.", "Job vacancies have declined from that peak, and the share of firms facing labour shortages has edged down.", "Moreover, job growth
