taking place in the different parts of the world, the region has been able to rise to the challenge and each time has demonstrated the ability to experience a swift rebound.", "Factors that have contributed to this resilience is not so much what we have done in response to the developments but it is what we have done previously that prepared us to weather these developments.", "These factors in varying degrees have included undertaking rebalancing and structural adjustments of our economies, economic and financial reforms, the development of our financial systems, pursuing greater fiscal discipline, building a more extensive policy tool kits, building buffers during the good times and advancing regional integration and cooperation.", "For most of the region, following these efforts, our more diversified economies have become less vulnerable to economic shocks, our more diversified and developed financial systems have been better able to absorb and intermediate the financial turmoil and turbulence, while the financial reforms have also increased our flexibility and produced better price and exchange rate adjustments.", "Those with sound macroeconomic fundamentals
