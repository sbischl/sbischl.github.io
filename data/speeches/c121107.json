credit risk management and concentrated lending.", "As Charles De Silva opined in his October 1990 article on \"The Law and the Central Bank: Issues and Implications for Banking Supervision in Trinidad and Tobago\", that was presented at the 22nd Annual Conference of the then Regional Programme of Monetary Studies, \"The non-bank crisis in Trinidad and Tobago immediately called into

inadequacies of the legislation itself.\"", "Unfortunately, the collapse of several finance companies and trust and mortgage finance companies was not averted.", "It is difficult, however, to know how long it took the officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to recognise the impending danger of the sheer size and rapid growth of non-bank activity in the economy.", "A heavy public outcry over the tardiness and reactive response on the part of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to protect their deposits, eventually led to the formation of the DIC in September 1986, more than 5 years after the Financial Institutions (Non-Banking) Act took effect in mid-1981, and more than 7 years after the Non-Banking Act was passed and assented to in 1979 but never proclaimed due to a still unexplained failure to publish the necessary regulations.", "The cost of the late arrival of deposit insurance to Trinidad and Tobago was not only reflected in the heavy financial support to problem institutions, but in the erosion of public trust and confidence in the regulatory authorities.", "The fledgling DIC immediately became responsible for managing the deposit insurance

highlighted the importance and urgency of establishing a legal framework for dealing effectively with resolution of cross-border financial entities.", "At its summit in Pittsburgh in October 2009, the

to be the most complex liquidation exercise in the Caribbean.", "As you can appreciate, these rescue actions are costly and run the risk of encouraging further moral hazard, that is, financial institutions might be tempted to take on even more risks in the future because they expect to be bailed out if their actions misfire.", "Best practices for deposit insurance systems Ladies and Gentlemen, in their quest to build safer financial systems, many countries are rethinking the design of their deposit insurance systems.", "They are assisted, in this respect, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has compiled a list of international best practices for deposit insurance systems around the world.", "On the basis of its research, the IMF recommends the following best practices for a deposit insurance system: 1.", "Be explicitly defined in law and regulation with a mandate and measurable objectives clearly understood by member institutions and the general public; 2.", "Be mandatory for financial institutions and accountable but free from unreasonable political interference; 3.", "Maintain good relations with other agencies in the safety net, especially the Central Bank which is the lender of last resort; 4.", "Allow supervisors a set of prompt corrective actions, resolve failed financial institutions promptly, and provide low coverage and pay out or transfer resources 5.", "Have timely access to accurate information on the condition of its members to overcome the problem of asymmetric information when a financial institution knows its conditions better than anyone else, charge adequate risk-adjusted premia, invest its fund prudently, and have government backing to avoid insolvency when unexpected failures occur.", "New DIC initiatives Ladies and Gentlemen, the DIC can be neither tardy nor reactive in strengthening its part of the national financial safety net.", "In this regard, the Board of Management of the DIC has formulated a strategic plan to make the Corporation's operational framework more consistent with international best practices.", "Some of the major elements of the DIC's strategic plan that are contemplated are as follows: Enact legislative amendments to close several gaps in DIC's enabling legislation as well as to harmonise it with the Companies Act and the FIA 2008; Begin the move towards an integrated deposit insurance system by expanding protection to cover depositors/shareholders of credit unions and policyholders (life) of insurance companies; Explore the feasibility of moving from a pure pay box model, in which the DIC comes in at the backend of the financial crisis, to that of a risk minimiser model, in which the DIC is in a situation where red flags are raised and prompt corrective actions can be taken against member financial institutions; Prepare the DIC to become compliant with the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Association of Deposit Insurers.", "This would include an evaluation of the DIC as part of an IMF Financial Stability Assessment Programme, known as FSAP; Establish a Memorandum of Understanding between the Central Bank and DIC to facilitate information sharing on member institutions and adequate alerts for a possible pay-out in the event of a pending failure/closure.", "In closing, Ladies and Gentlemen, I must caution you that, in the face of fundamental macroeconomic policy errors or significant contagion from abroad, even a good system of deposit insurance cannot guarantee financial stability.", "We must remember that a well-designed deposit insurance system is, at best, just one component of a sound financial safety net.", "Deposit insurance must be part of a carefully planned financial safety net, which establishes an incentive-compatible structure that encourages good corporate governance, constructive market discipline, and effective prudential regulation and supervision.", "The objective is, of course, to get to a position where taxpayer monies are never used to provide solvency support to a failing financial institution, no matter how large or complex.", "For their part, the DIC's Board of Management and Staff are committed to crafting a pro-active and efficient deposit insurance system to ensure continued coverage for all those who fall under its protective umbrella for another 25 years."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
