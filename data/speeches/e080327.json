reveals that episodes of strong economic growth in the 1960s and then in 1980s were both followed by the slowdown in growth and weaknesses in macroeconomic indicators.", "Why is Pakistan vulnerable to these cyclical downturns?", "Why cannot the country have sustainable economic performance?", "The oscillating growth performance over the years is largely because of inherent domestic structural rigidities which have yet to be effectively tackled to ensure macroeconomic stability and the desired growth path.", "Proper diagnosis and effective resolution of issues and implementation of broad ranging structural reforms is critical to skirt such bouts of slowdown in growth and instability.", "Aside from the broader development debates, what is unusual currently is that Pakistan's economy is simultaneously faced with twin shocks, global and domestic.", "The global shocks are represented by international financial market turmoil and the unprecedented increase in global commodity prices, while rising fiscal and external current account imbalances characterize the domestic shocks.", "In the backdrop of (relative) slowdown in foreign exchange inflows in FY2008, these shocks have resulted in pressure on the exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves, heavy government borrowings from the central bank, and a rise in domestic inflation.", "Combined, both international and domestic events have complicated short term economic management disrupting monetary management which had succeeded in bringing the core inflation down to 5.2% by May 2007 - below the peak levels of 8.3% in October 2005 and brought to surface more starkly the vulnerabilities economy faces.", "Like most economic phenomenon, these international shocks and domestic deficits are interrelated and

easing liquidity through special funding windows, cutting policy rate, in five rounds, to 225 bps and providing US$200 billion fiscal package.", "This package, while warranted, is fairly controversial because of the associated moral hazard and inflationary consequences of rate cuts and easing of liquidity.", "Since the appropriate size of the stimulus cannot be calibrated with any precision, the aggressive stimulus by way of a monetary accommodation is likely to compound the global inflationary pressures which were already rising in wake of (i) supply constraints magnified due to world wide

developing economies.", "This resulted in complacency and central banks' adopted accommodative monetary policy for longer period that induced excessive liquidity.", "Combined with regulatory and supervisory gaps in oversight of off-balance sheet and nonbank transactions, this provided opportunities for overleveraging without appropriate risk management frameworks.", "Arguably, these developments increased appetite for and under pricing of risk (although the pricing of risk was (and is) becoming increasing difficult in the face of fast-paced financial innovations), elevated asset

it be possible that by accommodating the oil and food prices and (attempting) to revive the economy, US is setting the stage for another round of easy monetary policy and liquidity situation.", "In my opinion, the key issue for central banks is to differentiate between need for short-term liquidity to rescue troubled financial entities and need for adoption of a credible monetary policy stance

lowering interest rates, central banks have to weigh inflationary risks against the risk of recession and financial instability.", "In bailing financial entities, the central banks have to be

years.", "The growth path was disrupted frequently by the inability of the government to adhere to prudent macroeconomic management and to consistently implement structural reforms.", "There is evidence, corroborated by the IMF Independent Evaluation Office1 that Pakistan's macroeconomic framework and structural reforms suffered because of the lack of ownership of economic agenda and excessive focus on macroeconomic stabilization without supportive real sector as well as institutional and structural reforms.", "This resulted in slippages in conditionalities and/or weak implementation of the reforms at best as releasing disbursement to meet economy's financial crunch outweighed compliance with structural reforms.", "Problems with design and sequencing of structural reforms resulted in suboptimal outcomes of policies adopted.", "Few striking examples would illustrate this.", "Macroeconomic stability has often been disrupted as fiscal slippages were a norm given

liberalization.", "Tightening of fiscal deficit over FY2002-2005, decline in debt3 and lower debt servicing (partly through the restructuring of external debt and partly through improved debt management) allowed space for raising development expenditures.", "Sustaining growth in development expenditures is becoming a challenging as tax base is limited by exemptions and a significant

at a critical cross road.", "On one hand, there are achievements to be recounted.", "The country's smooth, though protracted, transition to democracy and the preceding few years' economic performance that managed to excite foreign interest in Pakistan lends us confidence that Pakistan has strong economic potential and can attract global capital.", "On the other hand, there remain key economic risks and challenges that the country faces.", "Unless addressed holistically these could threaten economic prospects; a luxury Pakistan can ill-afford given the geopolitical context and the emerging global challenges.", "Re-emergence of twin deficits has complicated monetary management.", "Borrowings from SBP induce expansion in reserve money and Government's high recourse to banking system potentially crowds out private sector credit.", "These complications introduce volatility in overnight and other interest rates weaken the monetary policy transmission mechanism and hurts investment potential.", "Growing demand for goods and services, both from domestic sources and from abroad has helped domestic industry, but has also enhanced import reliance.", "Over FY03-07, import growth (including oil) averaged 24.7% outpacing export growth (13.4%) leading to a widening external current account deficit.", "During this period, capital inflows funded fully the external current account
