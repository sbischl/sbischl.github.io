the Mozart of Bologna and the Verdi of Milan - have an important common denominator: both are examples of how superb results can be achieved when there is the active will to discover and promote young performers and the conviction that music is both a means of education and a vehicle of ethical principles in society and for the formation of the younger generations.", "It was precisely this will and this conviction that gave birth to the Orchestra Verdi in 1993 and the Orchestra Mozart in 2004.", "Both testify to the richness of cultural life in today's Italy and to the presence in our country of a host of ambitious and successful initiatives for cultural development.", "My sincere thanks naturally go to the one of the great protagonists of this initiative -
