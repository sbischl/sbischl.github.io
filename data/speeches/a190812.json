global protectionism, geopolitical tensions, or uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union.", "The Financial Stability Report starts with the ever important conditions in the international environment, because they have a significant bearing on the conditions at At the global level, 2018 was marked by an economic slowdown experienced in home too.", "the second half of the year by advanced and, consequently, emerging economies.", "This put an upward pressure on the risk premia of countries in the region and prompted revisions to the growth outlook.", "Trade tensions between major world economies also fuelled uncertainty in international commodity and financial markets.", "In such an environment, the pace of normalisation of monetary policies of leading central banks, the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve System, was uncertain.", "What is the best response of policy makers to growing uncertainties in the external environment?", "The best, and in fact the only response, is to strengthen the domestic economy.", "In coordination with other economic policy makers, the National Bank of Serbia has worked continuously towards further narrowing of internal and external imbalances.", "More stable conditions of doing business reflected in price and financial stability, sound public finance and better prospects were also \"sealed\" by the Standard

continued to support economic growth that reached 4.3% last year.", "In July this year, we trimmed the key policy rate by another 25 bp, to 2.75%, which is its lowest level in the inflation targeting regime yet.", "We expect that this impulse will soon pass through to all segments of the market, thereby extending our support to economic growth going forward.", "Food, Energy, Alcohol and Tobacco Source: SORS, NBS and NBS caluculation.", "Surce: Ipsos/Ninamedia and NBS.", "The cost of financing declined, while disposable income of corporates and households increased.", "Continued monetary

we embarked on a monetary policy easing cycle, rates on dinar loans for households are now twice lower, while those for corporates are In the case of the government, an evident example is that of even three times lower.", "seven- where the interest rate fell year dinar securities from 13% at end-2013 to 3.59% this July.", "And this is exactly where the effect of full coordination of our policies and the progress Serbia made on the macroeconomic front is best seen.", "Considerably lower interest rates and the consequently higher disposable income, as well as economic growth accompanied with a rise in wages and the lowest unemployment rate, were the key drivers of lending activity.", "The y-o-y growth in loans to the private sector was almost two-digit in 2018, measuring 9.9%, and the loan structure was favourable.", "over RSD 240 bn worth of new investment loans was disbursed, which is the highest This supported the profitability of corporates, which has been on a constant rise level so far.", "The corporate sector ended 2018 with a net profit of RSD 500 bn, which is by If we look at company size, we RSD 126 bn or by one third more than the year before.", "will see that
