landscape that puts a premium on private sector risk management and public sector risk mitigation.", "Let me say a few words about both.", "Strengthening private sector risk management For the long-term investor, a fundamental shift is required, from thinking about a return target to considering appetite for risk and measuring and managing risk to the desired risk tolerance.", "The experience of the crisis provides some clear lessons for risk measurement and management, and points to the need for better tools for risk assessment, better information systems and information sharing, improved governance and compensation practices, and better communication.", "To assess the risk of an extreme event like a major earthquake, insurance experts do not rely on short spans of data because there would be very few, if any, major earthquakes in the sample.", "Yet, financial risk managers routinely use tools such as value-at-risk models that use relatively short windows of recent data to assess the likelihood of financial loss.", "To measure financial risk accurately, we need better tools that capture tail events and mitigate procyclicality.", "In particular, there is a

practices that align compensation with prudent risk taking.", "Implementation must be system-wide so that professionals and firms have a level playing field.", "Finally, financial firms, credit-rating agencies and financial advisers need to do a better job of communicating the suitability of products, and their inherent risks, to their clients.", "This requires better plain language disclosure.",

methods are the most effective.", "Public policy priorities Sound risk management makes the best of the situation at hand; mitigating risk improves the situation.", "And there is much public policy can do.", "While the lesson from history is that recoveries after financial crises are disappointingly gradual and bumpy, the future is not preordained.", "Public policy has a critical role to play in

like a convalescence.", "For private sector investors, the fundamentals of sound portfolio management have not changed, but the economic landscape has.", "Sovereign debt is no longer a risk-free
