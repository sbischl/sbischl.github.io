they believed in a price increase.", "Between August and October 2005 the price of natural gas rose by 50 per cent, partly as a result of the severe hurricanes.", "The fund earned substantial amounts of money and the fund managers were also expecting this autumn to see high energy prices during the winter.", "They bought futures for November and March and sold (sold short) contracts for October and April.", "However, this year did not develop as expected.", "During the period from August to mid-September the price of natural gas fell by 40 per cent and in a couple of weeks Amaranth lost USD 6 billion, which corresponded to two thirds of its capital.", "Despite the size of the amount, the market effects were largely non-existent and there was never any concern in terms of financial stability.", "The private sector also managed to settle its positions without any intervention from the responsible authorities.", "Does this mean that the concern over hedge funds is exaggerated?", "Or is increased regulation necessary?", "Before I discuss these questions, however, I would like to take a brief look back at the development of hedge funds in recent years.", "Hedge funds are a relatively new phenomenon in the Swedish market.", "However, the first hedge fund was established in the United States 60 years ago.", "At the end of the 1940s, US journalist Alfred Winslow Jones bought shares he considered to be under-valued and sold short shares he considered over-valued.", "His idea was that the price of under-valued shares should rise relatively more on a rising market and the price of over-valued shares should fall relatively more on a falling market.", "If the fund managers made a reasonable selection, this meant that the fund would earn money regardless of whether the market rose or fell - in other words the fund was protected, or hedged, against systematic market risk.", "In other words, the initial idea of hedge funds was to take positions based on the price relationships between securities, while limiting or eliminating market risk.", "Many people still connect the concept of a hedge fund with this strategy, but today this so-called market-neutral strategy is only one of many.", "Moreover, the concept hedge fund is misleading, as many of the funds do not hedge, but take large net positions.", "A common factor for hedge funds is that they have absolute earnings targets - rather than relating earnings to a benchmark index.", "They are also subject to much fewer restrictions concerning investment strategies than traditional funds.", "In addition to buying securities, the hedge funds can go short, that is to say, they can sell securities they do not own.", "Moreover, they can use pledges or derivatives to increase or decrease the risk in their fund management.", "Investments in hedge funds are often tied over a long period of time, which means that the fund can take on fairly illiquid positions.", "The charges are performance-based, which gives the fund managers a clear incentive to strive for good earnings.", "It is also common that fund managers themselves invest substantial amounts in their own hedge fund.", "However, hedge funds are far from a homogeneous group.", "One may roughly distinguish three overall investment strategies: market-neutral, directional and event-driven.", "Market-neutral strategies attempt, as I mentioned earlier, to exploit differences in the valuation of various securities, while trying to protect themselves against overall market risk.", "Directional strategies entail finding macroeconomic trends and trying to predict future market movements.", "Event-driven strategies aim to identify securities whose prices will be affected by specific corporate events, such as acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies.", "Neither of the latter two investment strategies is thus hedged in Jones' original sense.", "Many hedge funds describe themselves as \"multi-strategy\" -

most others had no positions, or contrary positions, in energy derivatives.", "This made settlement easier, if not cheaper.", "A further explanation is probably that Amaranth's losses occurred under very favourable economic and financial circumstances, where the market had good access to capital.", "This was far from the case when LTCM tried to settle its positions in the midst of the Russia crisis.", "Under more strained conditions, perhaps the sequence of events for Amaranth would have been entirely different and the risks to the financial system much greater.", "However, the fact that the financial system could manage the problems in Amaranth may also imply that it has become more resilient.", "The markets have demonstrated that they can manage a number of major strains in recent years, both macroeconomic shocks and unexpected market events, without any tangible effect on their functioning.", "The banks' management of risk and their collateral requirements do appear to be stricter than they were in 1998.", "We will return to a further discussion of the resilience of the financial system when the Riksbank's Financial Stability Report is published at the beginning of December.", "Does the hedge fund market require further regulation?", "As the hedge funds have grown, voices have been raised calling for more extensive regulation of the funds' operations.", "Ordinary investment funds are regulated by the UCITS directive.", "UCITS regulates, for instance, the type of assets a fund is allowed to invest in, the information that should be given to investors, and the diversification of risks.", "Hedge funds, on the other hand, are completely unregulated in many countries.", "In return, the authorities often require that investments in hedge funds should exceed a certain minimum level.", "The purpose of this requirement is to limit the hedge funds' investor circle to wealthy and, presumably, well-informed individuals and thereby to protect \"ordinary\" consumers.", "Most hedge funds are constructed so that the investor, under unfortunate circumstances, may lose all or at least large parts of his capital.", "In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission has long attempted to increase transparency in hedge funds.", "In February this year they introduced a new regulation that entails a registration requirement for most large hedge funds -
