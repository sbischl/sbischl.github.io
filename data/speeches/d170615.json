"Bankers should be proactively offering solutions to some of the pressing economic and financial issues facing the country.", "A positive voice for socioeconomic change can help instill greater public trust in the role of the banking sector in nation building.", "A current issue that has disproportionately drawn attention to banks is the affordable housing issue.", "Bank Negara Malaysia recently featured a box article on this subject in 2016 Annual Report.", "The public debate largely continues to misdiagnose or ignore the root cause of the problem, that is, affordability and accessibility, rooted by low incomes and compounded by the huge mismatch between demand and supply of affordable houses.", "The popular myth, is that it is all about access to financing.", "Actual data is selfevident.", "It shows the continued strength in bank financing to households for the purchase of affordable homes, with four in five new housing loans extended for houses priced below RM500,000.", "Yet banks have done little to educate and inform the public on this financing trend.", "The industry ought to be at the forefront in explaining the real situation and where possible, offering

the regional average of 6.2% .", "Monthly rentals of prime office space in Kuala Lumpur are the lowest among regional cities.", "Over the next few years, the significant incoming supply of large projects is likely to aggravate supply conditions in this segment.", "Signs of oversupply are also emerging in the retail segment in major urban centres in Malaysia.", "This can be traced to the abundance of shopping malls.", "You may be surprised to learn that there are as many as twenty shopping malls just along the 40km stretch of the LDP highway.", "It is equally astonishing that the prime retail space per capita in cities like Johor, Penang and Kuala Lumpur is actually higher than regional megacities such as Shanghai and Beijing, and also higher income cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong.", "A significant increase in vacancy rates, and the ensuing price corrections, are risks that the Bank has highlighted as far back as 2013.", "The concerns are not limited to effects within the commercial property sector, but have broader spillovers to other economic sectors.", "During the Global Financial Crisis, commercial property was a major driver of loan losses in Australia, France, Ireland and New Zealand, despite generally accounting for a much smaller share of banks' loan books, compared to residential property.", "This was attributable to a sharper pace of contraction in commercial property prices, compared to house prices.", "Banks are key stakeholders in this conversation.", "Data available within banks can be a harbinger of turns in the property cycle, and used more effectively in combination with other sources of market data, to smooth out adjustments between demand and supply.", "Furthermore, in the same way that reporting standards are starting to move away from provisioning practices that were \"too little too late\", there is merit in in taking a closer look at current valuation practices that contribute to property boom-bust cycles.", "It may well be time to consider how we might correct practices that are encouraging banks to lend \"too much too early\" in specific property segments, before demand drivers are firmly entrenched.", "At a

to support the transformation of our economy.", "As we progress, the industry has to be more innovative in product offerings to meet the demands of the new economy.", "These examples illustrate the

"There are other matters as well.", "Education in long-term financial planning among Malaysians, the impact of financial technology, expanded inclusion to financial services, income and productivity gaps, and labour market developments, are just some of the issues where banks ought to be much more active participants in the policy dialogue and debate.", "The Financial Markets Committee stands out as a forum that serves as a focal point for industry and external stakeholders on recent measures taken in the domestic financial markets.", "Likewise, similar initiatives can be mobilised to provide a more organised stage for the banking industry to lend its voice on a range of issues and contribute to more informed public opinion.", "It is time for the industry to be active stakeholders, rather than just passive participants.", "A World of Contrasts: Long-Term Interests Versus Myopic Gains Extending the theme of contrasts further, regulatory measures introduced in the past year have been the subject of much scrutiny.", "In many quarters, regulation is still widely perceived as an unnecessary constraint on markets.", "In reality, it is a means to safeguard longer-term public wellbeing against parochial interests.", "The intention behind regulatory measures may at times appear contrary to popular wisdom.", "Nonetheless, viewed through a broader lens, this is motivated by policymakers' duty to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability.", "In discharging this responsibility, policymakers must consider macro perspectives, be able to look further afield, evaluate risks, and take timely actions to manage these risks.", "The Global Financial Crisis provides a stark reminder that markets cannot be exclusively relied on to rein in excesses.", "Left to the market, there is always a tendency to overshoot.", "Market forces can at times deviate significantly from public interest.", "This is where policymakers step in to moderate these effects and steer markets back onto a sustainable path.", "This is infamously described as, central banks 'taking away the punch bowl, just as the party gets going '.", "One 'party' we saw developing was the imbalance in the foreign exchange market, more specifically in the ringgit non-deliverable forward (NDF) market.", "Measures taken by the Bank in December last year were aimed at further developing the onshore financial markets and limiting the influence of speculative pricing of the ringgit in the offshore market which had undermined the stability of the domestic foreign exchange market.", "Since the implementation of these measures, the exchange rate stabilised, with the 1-month implied volatility recording a lower average of 4.5%, against 9.9% before the measures were put in place.", "The average intraday movement recorded a daily average of 76 points while the bid-ask spread recorded an average of 25.0 basis points since end-February 2017.", "Of importance, the onshore foreign exchange market continues to record a healthy daily average volume of USD10 billion.", "Prior to the measures, the daily volume was around USD8 billion.", "The Malaysian bond market remains resilient.", "The last two primary auctions of government bonds recorded a healthy bid-to-cover ratio of more than two times.", "Following higher market demand, MGS benchmark yields have eased lower between 8 - 32 bps across the yield curve.", "Non-resident holdings of government papers have also been pared down from a peak of 34.7% to 25.3% as at end April 2017.", "More importantly, our surveillance indicates that the composition of stable and long-term investors is now much higher, with previous outflows mainly due to short-term speculative positions exiting the market.", "This is definitely a positive development.", "Malaysia remains a highly open economy and will continue to welcome the participation of longterm investors.", "Indeed, we remain a highly attractive destination for foreign direct investment.", "Returns on Malaysia's FDI assets have averaged 12.9% per annum between 2010 to 2016, higher than nominal GDP growth of 7.7% over the same period .", "Payoffs from investing in the real economy are one of the highest in the region, making Malaysia an important profit centre for investors.", "In the next seven months, the Bank will introduce further regulatory measures to strengthen the foundations for a strong and resilient banking system.", "First, we will implement a mandatory employment reference check for financial industry employees which is aimed at removing employee information asymmetries during job transitions.", "Second, we will share with the industry proposed revisions to the outsourcing policy to improve the governance and supervision of financial institutions, especially involving crossborder arrangements.", "The revisions also aim to better support the development of domestic expertise and capacity in core functions of the banking industry.", "Third, a shared security operations centre for the financial industry (FINSOC) will be established in coordination with the industry to support the continuous and proactive monitoring of cyber threats.", "Finally, by 2018, we hope to operationalise an industry-wide implementation of e-KYC for the on-boarding of customers.", "Further progress has also been made on the development of the policy framework for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs).", "Survey results collected from banking institutions and financial holding companies earlier this year are currently being analysed and will facilitate further refinements to the assessment methodology to identify D-SIBs.", "This will form part of the D-SIB policy framework which will be released later this year for industry consultation.", "Beyond the immediate term, the Bank is also looking at introducing enhanced standards on measuring capital requirements and outline expectations on recovery planning, in line with global reforms.", "In doing so, we will engage the industry on the potential domestic implications, and make adjustments where necessary to ensure that these standards are phased-in seamlessly.", "A World of Contrasts: Shifting From Macro Masterplans to Micro-Cellular Transformation Malaysia's transition to a high-income economy will require careful attention to the context in which policies are developed and pursued.", "In particular, behavioral changes shape the way people live and work.", "Thanks to globalisation and digitalisation, individuals are much freer to dictate their living, working and financing arrangements.", "Traditional institutions and conventional policy-making have less influence than before.", "This calls for a new approach to governing and policy making, one that combines high-level strategic clarity with experimentation and dynamic implementation at a micro level.", "Since 2000, the Government has produced 39 blueprints, roadmaps and master plans, including the Financial Sector Blueprint.", "This is more than double the number of master plans introduced between 1970 to 1999.", "From a different perspective, over the last 17 years, the country introduced two blueprints a year, compared to only one plan in every two years during the period 1970 to 1990.", "There is no denying that the plans have laid a great foundation for the nation to move forward.", "Indeed, the Economic Transformation Plan played a catalytic role in spurring, what we at the Bank like to refer to, as the Investment Renaissance period between 2011 and 2014.", "Going forward, there is a critical need to overlay these existing master plans and blueprints with micro-cellular transformations.", "We have been advocating this approach at every opportunity available.", "It is just as relevant for industry, including the banking sector.", "Very often, implementation pitfalls caused the failure of the strategic vision of leaders.", "I believe this gap can be bridged if each component, layer, and cell, within the ecosystem, whether at an institution or industry level, is empowered to support and even lead transformation.", "This micro transformation involves three elements: first, solving locally-nominated and defined problems; second, employing nudges or smart incentives to induce desired behavior; and third, experimenting on specific markets, groups or products before a broad roll-out.", "I must admit that these are hardly unfamiliar concepts in business.", "Yet few businesses have gone further to integrate these elements within broader transformation strategies.", "This has increasingly been the approach taken by the Bank, in facilitating initiatives such as the FinTech innovations in the financial sector.", "The Regulatory Sandbox introduced last year allows for the experimentation of potentially beneficial FinTech innovations that may seem inherently risky at inception, but properly harnessed could be a game changer.", "By providing a \"safe\" or \"contained\" space for testing, the risk effects can be comfortably observed, controlled and calibrated.", "Wider applications of this approach by institutions will go a long way to cultivate a balanced banking culture of innovation and resilience.", "Such applications are also not confined to the area of technology.", "It can span across a bank's decision to enter a new market, reform incentive structures, disrupt outdated internal processes and provoke changes in management paradigms.", "The possibilities are limited only by our attitude to change, our ability to adapt, and our willingness to pursue creative solutions within acceptable risk limits.", "Banks that will remain relevant in the future are those that have a deep understanding of the shifts in the economy and the consumer.", "This requires banks to have a finger on the pulse of the economy, to closely observe the micro transformations that are taking place, and to keep abreast of future financing opportunities, particularly in new areas of growth.", "To this end, banks will need to think ahead and begin to invest in developing the organisational capacity to study, distill and generate innovative solutions to effectively and efficiently meet new financing needs.", "With the development of alternative financing such as crowd funding, P2P, private equity, venture capital, factoring and leasing, it will be imperative for banks to consider how they can complement and support these arrangements more effectively.", "We are living in interesting times, shaped by forces that bring to the fore contrasts in economic and financial developments.", "These developments have important implications on how we govern, do business and engage externally.", "It has never been more important for the banking industry to be more engaged, agile and responsive.", "I do believe that our banks are well-placed to adapt to changes going forward.", "It is incumbent on the banking industry to continue to strengthen its foundations and address gaps that may appear through business and economic cycles.", "Banks cannot be oblivious to the changing tide.", "Our economic prosperity is very much influenced by the ability of the industry to play its intermediating role effectively."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
