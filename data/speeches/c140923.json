world with mine.", "Let me start with what we've all observed: the recovery from the global financial crisis has been underwhelming, to say the least.", "It has left us debating what kind of growth we can reasonably expect after so much disappointment.", "It has also left us debating how central banks should conduct monetary policy without compromising financial stability.", "During the crisis, central banks and governments took unprecedented action.", "They worked together to prevent the failure of systemically important financial institutions, and to provide exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus.", "These policies were successful in preventing the worst.", "But even this forceful policy response could not prevent a severe and protracted global recession.", "Massive amounts of wealth were destroyed.", "The values of equities and housing plunged.", "The loss to global output was roughly $10 trillion by the end of last year.", "All told, the crisis left the global economy with 62 million fewer jobs.", "The recovery has had repeated false starts and still faces considerable headwinds.", "Global growth has averaged only around 3 per cent over the past two years.", "That's well below the average prior to the crisis, and it is unlikely that 2014 will be much better.", "Financial markets are reflecting these lowered expectations.", "That's part of the reason why long-term interest rates in the major advanced economies, including Canada, are very low.", "Today I'm going to talk about three important matters for central banks.", "First, to conduct monetary policy, we need to know how much of this slow growth is cyclical and how much is structural.", "Second, to calibrate our policy we need to know how these factors, taken together, are affecting the neutral rate of interest.", "And third, making judgments about the impact of these factors is not an exact science.", "As you know, there is a lot of uncertainty.", "That is why we take a risk management approach to achieving our inflation target.", "Disentangling cyclical and structural factors So how much of this slow growth is cyclical and how much is structural?", "History teaches us that balance-sheet recessions such as the world has just seen are typically followed by growth that is much slower than in the wake of a normal recession.", "The legacy of a financial crisis is a heavy burden for any country, and paying down debt impedes normal economic growth for a long time.", "This makes the task of disentangling the cyclical from the structural more difficult, but it needs to be done in order to determine the rate of non-inflationary growth.", "As inflation targeters, the rate of potential output growth matters a lot to us.", "It is a critical input to the appropriate path for policy rates.", "Lost potential from the crisis Cyclical factors have clearly been playing a starring role in this underwhelming recovery.", "During the crisis, demand plummeted and so did output.", "As workers left the labour force and firms cancelled capital investments or went out of business, potential output growth declined as well.", "We are still facing headwinds from the deleveraging of households, fiscal consolidation and uncertainty.", "We estimate that potential output in Canada is about 3 per cent below where it would have been without the recession.", "That's roughly $3,500 per household.", "In the United States, where the crisis hit harder, estimates of lost potential range from 5 per cent to 13 per cent - that's US$6,500 to US$18,000 per household.", "Demographics and

GDP growth over the last five years.", "A new wrinkle is that working-age people are also leaving the labour force.", "This was discussed at length last month by central bankers at Jackson Hole.", "The decline in the participation rate of young and prime age workers reflects the cyclical effects of a weak job market.", "But these cyclical effects could become structural.", "After a long search, if you don't think you are going to find a job, at some point, you become discouraged and you stop looking.", "The longer you stay out of the labour force, the more likely it is that your skills have deteriorated and your attachment to the job market has weakened.", "This is what economists mean when we talk about hysteresis.", "Productivity growth We know that with a relatively smaller labour

and a half - and Canada has lost ground compared with the United States and some other countries.", "Pessimists argue that the high rates of productivity growth seen in the post-war era or the late-1990s are history.", "Optimists say that technological progress in areas such as nanotechnology, computing and genetic engineering will once again generate strong productivity gains.", "At the Bank of Canada, we take a balanced approach when we factor all of this into our views on productivity.", "We expect business investment to pick up, which will lead to labour productivity growth that is a little higher than it was before the crisis.", "However, it will only be about two-thirds of its peak of around 2 per cent in the late 1990s.", "A similar decline is also expected to occur in the United States and the euro area.", "Bottom line for potential The bottom line is that potential output growth in Canada and other industrialized economies will be lower than it was in the years leading up to the crisis.", "Our most recent estimate for Canada is that it will average just below 2 per cent over the next two years.", "This is a percentage point lower than average potential growth in the decade prior to the crisis.", "We will update this estimate in our next Monetary Policy Report in late October.", "We believe that some of the potential lost during the crisis will be restored through higher business investment and firm creation.", "But opinions vary on this.", "You may have read about a more extreme hypothesis, the idea of \"secular stagnation.\"", "This is the theory that there is chronically deficient demand in the global economy stemming from persistent headwinds and structural factors that predate the crisis.", "This is not the Bank of Canada's baseline view.", "We expect the cyclical factors restraining growth to continue to dissipate over the next few years.", "We are already seeing the positive effects on growth in Canada and the United States.", "Implications for the neutral rate Let me turn now to what this all means for the neutral rate of interest.", "The gap between the policy rate and the neutral rate serves as gauge of the degree of monetary stimulus in the economy.", "It helps us to calibrate monetary policy.", "The neutral rate is to economists what dark matter is to physicists.", "We are convinced it exists, it plays a central role in our models and analysis, but we can't directly observe it.", "So it's important to be clear about the concept and the uncertainty around it.", "The neutral rate I am talking about here is the real risk-free rate of interest that enables the economy to operate at full capacity with stable inflation after cyclical forces have dissipated.", "It is the interest rate that generates just enough savings to finance investment in the long-run.", "Since savings can flow across borders, the neutral rate in Canada is influenced by both domestic and foreign factors.", "We posted on our website today a background paper on the neutral rate that lays this out very clearly.", "Let me walk you through the highlights.", "Real interest rates have fallen worldwide over the last few decades, including in Canada.", "Given this decline and with such low interest rates today, it is reasonable to think that the neutral rate is lower than in the past.", "There are a number of structural factors related to investment and savings that explain why.", "Currently, investment is being held back by weak confidence and uncertainty about demand.", "These are cyclical factors, and hardly surprising given the duration of the crisis.", "The structural undercurrent here, though, is about the speed limit of the global economy.", "With the lower expected growth in potential output that I just discussed, we can expect lower returns to investment.", "With lower returns, investment will be weaker than it otherwise would be.", "When firms are investing less, their reduced demand for funds puts downward pressure on interest rates.", "The financial crisis also appears to have had a persistent effect on the capitalformation risk premium.", "As Robert Hall points out, this helps to explain why high profits and low interest rates are not boosting investment to a greater extent.", "At the same time, effective business credit spreads in Canada today are around 15 to 45 basis points higher than they were before the crisis.", "Wider spreads are likely to persist because of tougher financial regulations and other factors.", "The neutral rate is also being affected by the level of global savings, which has risen significantly in the last decade and a half.", "There are a number of factors at play, and they are expected to persist.", "For example, many emerging-market economies (EMEs), especially in Asia, are pursuing policies that contribute to high savings rates.", "At the same time, elevated oil prices mean large current account surpluses in many countries that export oil.", "These savings are being invested in advanced economy assets, especially those denominated in U.S. dollars.", "EME reserves have increased tenfold to US$8 trillion since 2000.", "New financial sector regulations are also reinforcing increased demand for safe assets in order to meet higher collateral requirements and liquidity buffers.", "All told, we think that the neutral rate of interest is lower than it was in the years leading up to the crisis because of these structural developments.", "We estimate that the real neutral policy rate is currently in the range of 1 to 2 per cent.", "This translates into a nominal neutral policy rate of 3 to 4 per cent, down from a range of 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 per cent in the period prior to the crisis.", "The neutral rate serves as an anchor for our models and analysis, but it is not a fixed beacon because the structural factors that influence it can change over time.", "Relative to this longer-term concept of neutral, the policy rate in Canada is stimulative.", "We need this stimulus to close the output gap and maintain inflation sustainably at target.", "But even with a closed output gap and inflation at target, the policy rate may not be at neutral.", "As long as the factors leaning on growth persist, a policy rate below neutral would be required to maintain inflation sustainably at target.", "In the absence of this policy stimulus, the output gap would reemerge and inflation would fall below target.", "Some of the headwinds appear to be dissipating, but there is considerable uncertainty about how long they will persist.", "Let's not forget that advanced economies' debt doubled from roughly 160 per cent of GDP to 320 per cent between 1980 and 2010, and will take a long time to unwind.", "In fact, the global savings rate is expected to increase over the next five years.", "A joint analysis by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision attempts to quantify this adjustment.", "It suggests that a 3-percentage-point increase in banks' common equity Tier 1 capital ratio would raise lending spreads by around 45 to 50 basis points.", "Estimates for Canada, prepared by the Bank of Canada, fall very close to this range.", "O.
