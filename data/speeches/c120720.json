entities are able to raise liquidity against their receivables.", "This problem can be institutionally tackled by factoring which provides liquidity to SMEs against their receivables and can be an alternative source of working capital.", "World over, factoring is a preferred route of accessing working capital for SMEs and even larger organisations.", "Some banks and financial institutions in India have already launched factoring services and I would urge more banks to offer such services, particularly for the MSMEs.", "To provide a legislative framework for factoring services, the

efforts of the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises, SIDBI, Government of India, state governments and the RBI notwithstanding, there continues to be a significant demandsupply mismatch in financing MSMEs on account of perceived high credit risk involved in financing such entities.", "Given the growing requirements of the sector, the need of the hour is to introduce innovative credit schemes for MSMEs such as supply-chain financing, whereby MSMEs can access short-term credit against the supplies while they await payment.", "This would ease the working capital requirements of MSMEs to a considerable extent and facilitate smoother operations.", "Products such as equipment lease finance can address the need for term finance, whereas products such as receivables financing, bills

issues are fundamental in improving SME competitiveness.", "Empirical studies show that human capital is a significant determinant of growth.", "The ability of SMEs to adjust to the competitive

building support that is very crucial to MSMEs.", "However, given the growing requirements of the MSME sector and the huge \"demographic capital\" we possess, significant efforts are still needed to enhance the skill and entrepreneurship development.", "My thoughts on this important area are: (i) In addition to the initiatives taken by Government agencies, the industry, through a process of training and handholding, has to contribute to building up a large base of appropriately skilled workforce available for employment in MSMEs.", "(ii) There should be training programmes by the industry associations to upgrade the skills of the workers and to acquaint them with the skills compatible with the new technology and (iii) entrepreneurship training in school curricula should be incorporated to enable the young minds develop the orientation and mindset to become entrepreneurs later in their careers.", "As the cliche\u0301 goes \"If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day.", "If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime\".", "Risk management and governance From a balance sheet perspective, risk is defined as the probability of actual cash flows falling below the projected cash flows.", "Some estimate that 90% of small business failures are caused by poor cash flows.", "Anticipating the cash flow problems and developing the necessary coping skills to manage these shortfalls should be at the core of risk management strategy for MSMEs.", "Given the heightened volatility in recent times, MSMEs are increasingly exposed to various other risks such as interest rate risk and currency risks.", "MSMEs need to manage these risks to remain viable.", "The MSMEs need to understand with appropriate support from the capacity building institutions in the form of seminars and workshops, the importance of corporate governance and its linkages with risk management.", "A small enterprise that Infosys was way back, could grow into a leading international firm today, thanks partly to its sound governance framework.", "Investors would often lower the cost of their lending when the governance structures are sound, leading to cost competitiveness of the MSMEs.", "Therefore, to become globally competitive, going forward, it is imperative that our MSMEs develop their skills in risk management and governance so as to have a sound Risk Governance.", "Competing for growth (not survival) Management guru, late C.K.", "Prahlad produced two seminal works, viz., Competing for the Future and Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.", "I would like to say that both are very relevant for MSMEs today.", "Inclusive growth strategies such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are going to enhance the capacity and willingness of the rural population to increase their consumption.", "This will increase the \"Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid \" i.e., purchasing power of the lower strata of the society.", "MSMEs, being nimble footed and in proximity to the bottom of the pyramid are bound to benefit from this increased consumption.", "At the international level, MSMEs may have to face global competition, but the opportunities for growth are immense only if MSMEs are focused on quality and use appropriate technologies.", "As I mentioned earlier, innovative ways of financing the working capital needs of MSMEs is another important aspect to help them grow and compete.", "Role of MSME associations The Chambers of Commerce and MSME Associations in our country can play a pivotal role in facilitating finance for MSMEs through various pro-active measures.", "These institutions can also create greater awareness among their MSME members about credit facilities from banks, NBFCs and financial institutions, benefits of credit rating, alternate finance options such as venture capital / angel funding, factoring, bills discounting, recently launched SME Exchange / platform, etc.", "in addition to engaging with policymakers and organising training / capacity building programmes.", "Concluding thoughts Let me now conclude by stating that MSMEs play a very critical role in the economic development given their contribution in employment generation, export competitiveness and, more importantly, entrepreneurial development.", "As MSMEs are spread across the length and breadth of the country and have a strong presence in rural areas, their growth also leads to more balanced and sustainable development and eases pressure on urban infrastructure.", "Given the present state of economy, MSMEs can play a very critical role in renewing our export competitiveness and boost economic recovery.", "For these reasons, I would emphasise that building a robust and resilient MSME sector is imperative need of the hour.", "The extent of financial exclusion in the MSME sector is very high.", "As only 5 to 10% of MSMEs are covered by institutional funding, there is a need to bridge the huge gap through enabling policies.", "Banks and financial institutions need to support the MSMEs in their need for finance.", "Some of them could grow into large corporates and potential MNCs in future.", "The Reserve Bank of India is endeavouring to support the MSME sector by providing an enabling policy environment and I urge all the banks and financial institutions to implement our guidelines in both letter and spirit to increase the credit flow to this vital sector.", "MSME Associations and Chambers of Commerce also have an important role to play in this formidable task of building a robust MSME sector.", "On their part, the MSMEs should be responsible borrowers, should use the bank credit in a judicious manner and take advantage of the business opportunities both within and outside the country.", "They should improve their governance and risk management practices, maintain proper books of accounts, submit correct information to banks and all authorities, and make their operations more efficient and productive to get easier access to finance from banks and other investors.", "With the concerted efforts of all the stakeholders I am sanguine that MSME sector would become more competitive and efficient and offer greater contribution to economic development.", "I congratulate the Indian Chamber of Commerce for organizing this important conference and I wish
