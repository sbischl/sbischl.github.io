the focus is further ahead.", "With the CPIX again approaching the target range, it is relatively easily to somewhat superficially argue the merits of an inflation-targeting regime.", "Some disadvantages of inflation targeting must, however, be acknowledged.", "Whilst easily understood in terms of its objective, it is a complicated approach, more demanding and more difficult to implement than a monetary framework based on targeting monetary growth or a more discretionary framework.", "It implies greater reliance on forward indicators of inflation and a continuous assessment of the relationship between the instruments of monetary policy and the inflation target.", "Where forecasts turn out to be wrong, even if for completely unforeseeable reasons, the central bank's credibility could be impaired.", "Of course, the counterargument being that it simply makes visible the uncertainty that would remain hidden in other monetary-policy frameworks.", "Inflation targeting, if pursued at any costs, runs the risk of inefficient output stabilisation.", "Significant supply shocks to the economy such as sharp oil price movements, could require very large monetary-policy adjustments to bring inflation back inside the target range within the stated time horizon.", "For such exceptional events, some discretion and patience in re-achieving the target range should be allowed for.", "In this regard I wish to confirm that the Reserve Bank generally views it inappropriate to resort to the escape clause, and would rather provide an explanation to any deviation from the target range once the final outcome of the CPIX average for that year had been published.", "This view is held so that the market has no doubt regarding the Bank's vigilance and commitment to achieving its targets.", "Indeed, following the CPIX average for the year 2002, which could only be calculated early in 2003, where the average exceeded the target, an explanation was provided in the Monetary Policy Review document of April 2003.", "(The bi-annual Monetary Policy Review is also available on our website).", "The advantages of inflation targeting are also worth highlighting.", "Firstly, transparency - the concept is easily understandable, with the ultimate policy objective translated into an explicit target value.", "Secondly, inflation targeting provides enhanced clarity about the objective of monetary policy, which is conducive to sound planning in both private and public sectors.", "Thirdly, the framework provides for improved accountability of the Reserve Bank.", "It eliminates the need to rely on a stable relationship between the money stock and inflation, which has become increasingly difficult to identify; inflation targeting enhances economic policy co-ordination with government and the central bank both publicly committed to the same inflation target.", "And lastly inflation targeting provides an anchor for inflation expectations and price and wage setting, thus reducing the friction which arises from widely divergent inflation expectations.", "May I conclude with the comment that, whilst inflation targeting is certainly no panacea, the Reserve Bank still regards it as the most appropriate framework for achieving relative price stability.", "I quote from our Annual Economic report 2003, released last week: \"Sound and consistent price signals are invaluable in directing resources towards their most efficient uses\"; achieving this goal is, we believe, our most important contribution we can make towards optimal economic growth and development.", "Finally, I also, as Governor, thank the BIS most sincerely for their invaluable role in co-hosting the seminar.", "Our relationship with the BIS is excellent and we have derived much value in our interaction with this much-esteemed institution over many years.", "I hope you, as delegates, will extract maximum value from the expertise which is available to be shared.", "May you all safely return home, and your return on your FX assets be stable and gratifying!"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["inflation targeting", "reserve management", "monetary policy", "inflation", "central bank", "repo rate", "exchange rate", "CPIX", "credible", "anchor"]}
