and better integrated economic area to support growth and job creation.", "The current crisis represents a fundamental test of our monetary union's ability to achieve that dual objective, and it seems to me that there are two lessons that we should learn from it.", "The first is that the people of Europe and their governments are far more attached to the single currency than certain observers have suggested.", "The second is that our institutional framework is not yet sufficient to complete Economic and Monetary Union when it comes to economic, fiscal and financial matters.", "The ECB does not currently have a strong political counterpart in these areas.", "Thus, our monetary union will remain imperfect, will not be as prosperous as it could be and will face the risk of repeated crises if

backward [and] no interest in going forward, but it is economically unsustainable to stay still.", "\"1 I would like to say a few words today about the major challenge that this poses and what we can do about it.", "The paradox of the euro during the crisis It should be noted, first of all, that the euro has proved to be something of a paradox: confidence in the single currency remains very high, despite the fact that the euro area is struggling to emerge from the crisis and the fragilities of our economic and political union have threatened the integrity of the euro area on several occasions.", "a) Confidence in the single currency During the crisis, certain observers have underestimated the extent to which the people of Europe and their governments support the euro.", "In spring 2015 a very large majority of the population of the euro area was in favour of the single currency.", "69% of respondents to the Eurobarometer survey were in favour of Economic and Monetary Union and the euro, 25% were against it and 6% were undecided.", "That figure of 69% is close to the highest value recorded since 2004 for that question (which stands at 70%).", "The countries of the

borrowers.", "And in April 2015 Mexico became the first sovereign state to issue a bond denominated in euro with a maturity of 100 years.", "There are several different factors that could explain that confidence in the single currency.", "First of all, the euro forms an integral part of the European identity.", "It is also considered to guarantee stability (by protecting purchasing power) and

all of our monetary policy decisions during the crisis.", "b) The fragilities of our economic union At the moment, however, there is no such confidence in our ability to fully reap the economic benefits of our monetary union and ensure stability and growth in the euro area.", "In the spring of 2015, 45% of respondents in the euro area said they believed that the worst of the crisis was yet to come.", "European Central Bank, The international role of the euro, July 2015.", "At constant exchange rates, the euro's share of global foreign exchange reserves has fallen by 1 percentage point

allowed to develop in a number of euro area countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards: investment in the housing sector instead of the productive economy, excessive risk taking in the banking sector and massive external indebtedness.", "Participating countries have taken the benefits of the euro for granted without acknowledging their shared responsibility.", "The negative effects of this

complicated by several factors.", "It has been necessary to develop new instruments as a matter of urgency in the midst of the crisis.", "Some of those instruments, particularly the financial assistance programmes, are governed by a decision-making mechanism which is not conducive to the development of shared responsibility for policies concerning the future of the euro area.", "This intergovernmental decision-making process involves endless negotiations, particularly when it comes to issues with redistributive implications, and highlights the differences between the positions of the various Member States.", "Thus, it runs the risk of a conflict between the legitimate democratic interests of individual countries, without offering sufficient legitimacy at European level in return.", "The raison d'e\u0302tre of this approach is, admittedly, to allow each government to sign up to shared decisions.", "However, experience shows that it does not ensure that governments take ownership of those decisions at national level.", "What is more, it does not prevent the polarisation of the debate at European level or the temptation to engage in nationalist posturing.", "Finally,

responsibility to avoid the same fate befalling the euro area.", "Renewing the European project We must be clear, however: the euro area is an irreversible project, not simply a fixed exchange rate

put back in its bottle once and for all until it is clear that such a risk will not rear its head again.", "We need to use the confidence in the single currency to build institutions that will reinforce the cohesion of our economic and political union.", "To achieve this, we need to recreate the sense of shared responsibility.", "This will require the objectives of political and economic integration in the medium term to be better defined, and work will need to begin immediately to implement them.", "And as this will not be possible without the support of European citizens, we must respond to their concerns in the short term, by reducing unemployment and consolidating the recovery.", "a) Our shared goals Since 2010, the integration of the euro area has progressed under the pressure of the crisis, with agreements often reached at the last minute.", "We all have in mind Jean Monnet's remark that \"Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises\".", "But some of these solutions, improvised in a hurry, are not always long lasting.", "For example, the European Stability Mechanism is an impressive achievement and could become the foundation of a \"euro area Treasury\", under the condition that it is brought under the umbrella of the EU's treaties and under the control of the European Parliament.", "\"Integration by crisis\" has proved effective, but it no longer inspires the support of the citizens (if it ever did).", "So, the euro must be associated with a positive \"narrative\" and equipped with the necessary

reflection goes beyond just the economic sphere; it also encompasses key determinants of power, such as technology, energy and even foreign policy and security.", "In federations, public investment in such common goods is centralised.", "Here in the European Union, we are a long way from that.", "And yet, we face the same international challenges.", "We are asking ourselves these questions so we
