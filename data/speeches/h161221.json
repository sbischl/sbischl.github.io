due in large part to a range of intensive supervisory actions, progress within institutions, as well as the improving economy - the outstanding numbers remain high both in absolute and relative terms.", "Retail mortgages are the largest component of total NPLs, accounting for 57 percent, and are falling more slowly than other categories, despite the clear momentum in their reduction.", "SME/Corporate loans represent 17 percent of NPLs, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans amount to 22 percent, and consumer loans account for approximately 3 percent of total NPLs.", "Financial Strength In terms of the ability of the banks to absorb shocks or unexpected losses, all of the retail banks exceed the regulatory capital minima.", "As banks move towards new ('fully-loaded') regulatory capital requirements, capital ratios on this basis are 15.2 percent on average.", "The recent EUwide stress test included two of the domestic retail banks (AIB and BOI), and illustrated that these banks would have enough capital over three years to withstand the adverse economic scenario.", "However, their key capital ratios would have declined to 7.4 and 7.7 percent under this adverse scenario.", "The main driver of this outcome was a projected increase in credit impairments, consistent with recent loss history in Ireland.", "It is noteworthy that the stress testing assumptions and method were particularly challenging for those banks and countries that had suffered the most significant losses during the crisis and were most reliant on interest income.", "Nonetheless it is a timely reminder that much remains to be done to improve the resilience of the domestically focused banks operating in Ireland.", "Financial strength will remain a focus for the Central Bank together with the ECB in our ongoing engagement with the banks."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Irish banking sector", "Non-Performing Loans", "Domestically-focused banks", "Financial strength", "Capital ratios", "Regulatory capital requirements", "Stress testing", "Credit impairments", "Interest income", "Resilience"]}
