and in turn creating a \"bad bank\".", "In the Nordic banking crisis 20 years ago, we did both, and learned three important lessons: First, government crisis resolution measures do not have to be costly for the taxpayer.", "The state injected equity capital, while private share capital was written down on the basis of a realistic assessment of loan losses.", "This ensured that the equity capital injected by the state could benefit from upside opportunities.", "In Norway, the state assumed 100 per cent ownership of the three largest banks.", "The board of directors and senior management in each bank were replaced.", "Then, in the years following the crisis, the state gradually sold its shares in the nationalised banks -
