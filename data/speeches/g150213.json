implications of the fall in oil prices and whether our policy rate of 1 per cent was still appropriate.", "Monetary policy was already stimulative.", "Yet our initial projections suggested that if oil prices were to settle around $60 per barrel, and we did not change the policy path we had anticipated last October, it would take until late 2017 for the output gap to close.", "We thought that was an unreasonably long time frame, especially coming on the heels of successive delays in closing the output gap and achieving full employment.", "The oil-price shock increased the downside risks to inflation, particularly given the uncertainty about the strength and timing of the offsets coming from the stronger U.S. economy and a weaker Canadian dollar.", "That, in and of itself, warranted a response.", "Lower oil prices also increased the risks to financial stability because they could trigger the household vulnerabilities that we had warned about in our Financial System Review.", "In order to meet our inflation target over a reasonable time frame, while insuring against financial stability risks, we lowered the policy rate.", "What we expect to achieve extends beyond the 25-basis-point cut itself.", "Our policy action has eased monetary conditions by affecting the full range of asset prices.", "This is the normal transmission of monetary policy and will support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen investment and growth.", "It will also support financial stability by helping offset the reduction in incomes and the risk of higher and more persistent unemployment.", "With this new starting point, we reduced our growth expectations for the first half of 2015 to 1 1/2 per cent.", "We expect the economy to then rebound in the second half of the year, reaching its full capacity around the end of 2016 - a little later than expected in October.", "Weaker oil prices will pull down the inflation profile, more than offsetting the direct effect on prices that we are seeing from a lower Canadian dollar.", "We expect headline inflation to fall temporarily below 1 per cent this year and move back up to target next year.", "The labour market will recover as the output gap closes and the divine coincidence that I talked about earlier will eventually be re-established.", "This happens as output increases, firm creation and business investment picks up, and capacity is rebuilt.", "As this occurs, the signals coming from the labour market gap and output gap will become more consistent.", "Of course, there is a risk that additional capacity won't be added fast enough to keep the output gap from temporarily going positive.", "An economy pushing up against the limits of its capacity may be just what is required to signal the need for additional investments and to draw workers back into the labour force.", "There is uncertainty about how much potential can be rebuilt, and we need to take this into account in our risk-management approach to monetary policy.", "Our inflation-targeting framework gives us flexibility on the timing to achieve the inflation target while also taking into account other important dimensions of the economy - such as financial stability and the economy's potential.", "Stifling the rebuilding phase of the recovery could mean lost economic opportunity.", "That being said, if potential output growth turns out to be lower than we think, we have the tools to bring inflation back to target.", "There is no doubt that the Canadian economy has room to grow.", "The stronger U.S. economy, a lower dollar and our monetary policy response will work to keep the recovery in Canada on track and to get inflation sustainably back to target.", "There will be some adjustments across the country as non-energy exporters take on the mantle of growth.", "As this happens, Canadian firms and workers will need to demonstrate the impressive ability to adjust that we have seen in the past.", "Monetary policy is contributing to this effort by providing an environment of low and stable inflation, while supporting the adjustments needed to return the economy to sustained and balanced growth.", "We'll get there and it will
