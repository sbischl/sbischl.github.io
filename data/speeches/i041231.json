higher prices and lower output.", "Hence, if oil prices were to remain quite high, economic prospects for some of the western industrial countries, particularly those whose economies were not especially robust to begin with, could be more noticeably affected than would be the case in, say, China or India.", "A really serious adverse shock from this source looks less likely now, however, than it did a month or two ago, with oil prices having declined quite sharply from their peak.", "Financial markets have certainly responded in a fairly relaxed way to these developments.", "Bond yields remain fairly low by historical standards, particularly given the back-drop of a tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve.", "This is a rather different response to some other episodes where oil prices have risen substantially, as shown in the table below, which suggests that a persistent rise in inflation is regarded as unlikely.", "This may reflect an expectation that the adverse effects on growth for the industrial countries will inhibit any lasting inflation impact, but is also consistent with the idea that neither growth nor inflation may be affected by very much or for very long.", "Change in US 10-year Government Bond Yield 1 year into oil price rise Beginning of oil price rise Change in bond yield (bps) September 1973 +104 December 1978 +118 February 1999 +113 October 2003 -28 Source: US Federal Reserve, Global Financial Data The latter view probably fits more easily with the fact that markets are demanding relatively little compensation for credit risk.", "A significant weakening of growth in the industrial countries would surely have some adverse implications for emerging market countries, and lesser quality corporates.", "If that were expected, we would presumably see it reflected in risk spreads - but we do not see that.", "At present, then, markets apparently do not anticipate much in the way of adverse impact from the energy price changes.", "Either that, or there is a tension between various markets, the resolution of which will be fascinating to watch.", "But the main point is still that the current level of oil prices is mainly a sign of global demand strength - it is just that some of the strength is in different places from historical patterns.", "For Australia, a global growth situation that is strong enough to be exerting upward pressure on energy (and other resource) prices, and where growth is weighted towards Asia, seems for the moment to be quite a favourable one.", "According to the national accounts, Australia recorded moderate growth in 2004.", "It looks like GDP growth over the four quarters to December will be less than 3 per cent unless there is a big surprise for the December quarter or upward revisions to previous quarters.", "Let me leave aside the apparent contrast with the picture painted by the various business surveys, which is considerably stronger, and for the moment take the figures as given.", "That leaves growth running more slowly than was anticipated earlier in the year.", "But if output growth fell slightly short of expectations, it was not due to apparent lack of demand.", "Growth in domestic final demand has run at something like 5 per cent over the past year, and an average rate of nearly 6 per cent per year over the past three years.", "And growth in global demand for things Australia produces has, over the past year or two, been generally as strong as at any time in the past few decades.", "Click to view larger If demand growth is so strong, why hasn't the economy grown faster?", "Have we hit capacity limits?", "Indicators of capacity utilisation available in business surveys are certainly at or close to the highest levels seen in the past 15 years.", "This is a feature across surveys, and has been for some time.", "In the labour market, the rate of unemployment is at its lowest for more than 25 years.", "Other measures of under-utilisation of labour are not at two-decade lows, but have nonetheless declined a good deal.", "A significant proportion of firms refer to difficulties in finding suitable staff.", "Areas of skill shortage have emerged.", "Observable upward pressure on wage and salary rates is minor at this stage, though there are reports of non-wage employment costs rising in some sectors.", "The clearest evidence of hard capacity constraints is probably on the export side.", "In some parts of the resource sector there was a significant volume of investment in the second half of the 1990s, but a subsequent period of weak commodity prices saw investment decline to very low levels.", "Hence, the increase in demand in the past two years apparently left some producers without the capacity to take full advantage of the conditions by shipping higher output, though of course they have enjoyed higher prices.", "The rise in prices presumably reflects pressure on capacity globally, which suggests that producers everywhere were surprised.", "There have also been reports of capacity constraints in some of the key areas of transport infrastructure, such as ports and rail.", "A decline in exports of some fuels was due to a rundown in reserves, a capacity constraint of another sort.", "At the margin, the weakness of manufactured exports might reflect the strength of domestic demand, which for some producers may have presented an opportunity for sales in an easier market than some foreign alternatives.", "It might reflect the rise in the exchange rate (ie demand rather than supply), though the export weakness dates from a time when the exchange rate was much lower.", "So where does this leave us?", "There is no hard and fast answer, but there are reasonable grounds for thinking that the Australian economy is now operating closer to full capacity than it has for some time.", "We don't want to overstate this: it could not be claimed that physical limits have been reached across the board (though apparently they have been in a few areas).", "The best forecast for inflation, moreover, remains one of only a gradual increase over the coming two years, and no recent price or wage data have cast any doubt on that view.", "But it does seem to be getting a bit harder to coax above-average growth from the economy.", "In the thirteenth and fourteenth years of expansion, this is not surprising.", "Most of the easy gains in lifting output by reducing cyclical slack are by now behind us.", "It just means that very strong demand growth is now less likely than before to foster rapid output growth and more likely, at some stage, to risk pressure on prices, even though that does not seem imminent at the moment.", "It was therefore appropriate to have the somewhat less accommodative monetary stance of the past year and to signal in recent the likelihood - assuming the economy evolved as expected - of higher interest rates at some stage.", "A continuation of a robust expansion will, it seems, be increasingly dependent on enhancing the side: growing the capital stock, more effectively matching the supply of and demand for both skilled and unskilled labour, and innovation to lift the productivity of all the factors of production.", "I have talked about exports, but not as yet addressed the issue of Australia's current account deficit.", "But since it has been in the news recently, is there anything useful to be said?", "The risk in this is that people may misinterpret my remarks as indicating that the current account deficit is, se, something to be addressed by monetary policy.", "So I shall state clearly that it is not.", "Actually, whether the current account position should be an objective of policy is not obvious - that would need to be argued.", "But whatever one's view on that question, let me be clear that the current account is not, and should not be, an objective for monetary policy.", "We have had that debate in Australia.", "It was settled more than a decade ago, and I do not wish to re-open it.", "With those preliminaries, let us see what can be said about recent trends.", "The trade arithmetic is wellknown.", "It may therefore be of more interest to examine the financial counterparts -
