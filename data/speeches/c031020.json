minimizes tax related distortions linked to the interaction of inflation and the tax code.", "The determined focus of monetary policy on price stability has contributed to anchoring the public's inflation expectations at low levels.", "The increasing scepticism of the 1960s and the 1970s about monetary policy's ability to fight inflation has given way to confidence that prudent, consistent and forward-looking monetary policy can contain the destructive forces of inflation.", "Global inflation figures suggest that such confidence is largely justified.", "In the industrialized world, inflation declined from 12% in 1980 to 1.4% in 2002.2 In the developing world, the decline of inflation has been even more remarkable with yearly rates tumbling from an average of 31 percent in the early 1980s to currently under 6%.", "Along with a significant decline in inflation, volatility of economic growth has fallen everywhere.", "Both in the U.S. as well as in Germany, the volatility of real GDP, averaged over four quarters, was about 30 percent less during the 1984 to 2002 period than it was between 1960 and 1983.4 The evidence therefore confirms that monetary policy efforts to achieve and maintain price stability promote stability in output and thereby help create economic conditions which are ultimately conducive to employment creation.", "New Challenges for Monetary

community to consider its job done.", "There will be no \"End of Central Banking\".", "For one thing, there is no guarantee that the elimination of inflation throughout much of the world economy is a permanent achievement.", "Moreover, with the achievement of what constitutes for all practical purposes price stability across many economies, a number of central banks discovered that with it came a new challenge: policy could no longer be directed exclusively to push inflation lower but had to pay at least as much attention to avoid inflation that could conceivably fall too low and thereby undermine the goal of price stability by initiating deflationary tendencies.", "As has traditionally been the case, vigilance will therefore continue to be the \"Leitmotiv\" for the world's central banks.", "Global Competition and Disinflation A number of factors have contributed to the striking disinflation since the 1970s.", "Good monetary policy has undoubtedly made an important contribution

running companies in a global competitive environment.", "You need no sophisticated economic analysis to tell you that when exposed to fierce global competition, monopoly rents and pricing power decline and prices therefore come under downward pressure.", "Switzerland: one Country - two Economies As a small open economy, Switzerland is greatly affected by global cyclical let alone global structural developments.", "Unfortunately, over the last twenty years, our economy only partly subjected itself to the global market place.", "It has therefore developed along diverging paths.", "Our export sector has been fully exposed to the competitive forces of global economic and financial integration.", "Many of you represent this sector.", "To remain competitive in the global market place, you have had to innovate your production processes in a continuous attempt to increase your productivity.", "In light of Switzerland's large current account surplus (50 billion CHF or 12% of GDP in 2002), you have been additionally challenged by a real exchange rate which, over the last ten years, has on average appreciated by 0.6%.", "For the most part, the Swiss export sector has risen to that challenge.", "By contrast, the domestically oriented sectors of the Swiss economy have to a large extent remained sheltered from the competitive forces of an increasingly open global economy by an intricate web of regulatory measures which have prevented the product market from functioning according to market principles.", "Examples are numerous: The electricity market remains regionally monopolized.", "As a result, Swiss enterprises must bear higher electricity costs than their international competitors.", "In the telecommunication market, the achieved results in the deregulated part

"While the export sector has continuously managed to achieve high productivity growth rates, productivity has lagged behind dramatically in the domestic sector of the economy.", "Since the domestic sector continues to represent the bulk of the Swiss economy (approximately 60% of GDP), the poor performance of the domestically oriented sectors undermines the growth potential of the Swiss economy.", "In light of the rapidly deteriorating demographics and the pressure this will inevitably exert on our social services and programs, such a shortfall in growth can have debilitating longer-term consequences.", "(see annex for graph 3) With the post-bubble collapse in the equity markets, a heated political debate has emerged in Switzerland as well as in many other countries about the sustainability of our retirement and social welfare programs.", "Ideas, concepts and frameworks are being discussed by politicians and frequently commented upon by the media.", "The fact that these difficult long-term problems which lie at the heart of our social contract are being openly debated is a welcome development.", "However, short of reneging on promises that are deeply embedded in our cultural and social fabric, the most meaningful way to address these problems in the decades to come is to invigorate our economic growth performance.", "The challenge for our politicians is a formidable one.", "The political interests that defend the legislative hurdles which distort the domestic sector of our economy and thus undermine our growth potential are deeply entrenched.", "Never does this become more obvious than during a parliamentary electoral campaign.", "Admittedly, painful short-term adjustment problems might emerge once the reform process is initiated.", "Accelerating productivity growth rates can - in the short term - lead to a further reduction in employment as uncompetitive industries are compelled to restructure.", "In the longer-term, however, a rise in productivity is unquestionably beneficial.", "Ultimately, it will lead to higher growth rates.", "As the time bomb of demographics continues to tick, it will become increasingly obvious that this process is not a luxury our society can contemplate.", "Monetary Implications of Globalization Let me now return to monetary policy.", "I have attempted to sketch out how after the \"Great Inflation of the 1970s\", global financial and economic integration boosted competition, raised productivity growth rates and ultimately helped bring about an extraordinary reduction in global inflation and along with it a reduction in output volatility.", "As I have mentioned earlier, there is no doubt that good central banking itself has made an important contribution.", "But ultimately central banks have also benefited from the process.", "With inflation receding, many central banks have been able to focus increasingly on what typically constitutes a subordinate element of their legislative mandate: stabilization of output.", "In other words, a structural decline in the rate of inflation has increased the margins of manoeuvre for central banks.", "This does not alter the fact that central banks have no ability to fine-tune the real economy.", "Moreover, an important body of academic literature suggests that monetary policy has also become more effective as markets shed regulatory impediments.", "Monetary policy is therefore not only one of the forces behind the dramatic decline of inflation since the early 1980s.", "Perhaps more importantly, it has been one of the main beneficiaries of the globalization process.", "This insight has tremendous significance for Switzerland where, as I have attempted to show, much of the non-tradable sector of our economy remains tied up in a structural straight jacket.", "Eliminating this straight jacket or at least unbuttoning it would have wide-ranging positive effects on the Swiss economy.", "If our legislative authorities rise to that challenge, they are likely to replicate the competitionboosting effect that the forces of globalization have exerted on the external sector in the domestically oriented sectors of our economy.", "Higher productivity growth rates would ultimately lead to higher growth rates and thus reverse a worrying trend of declining relative growth dynamics in Switzerland in comparison with other OECD countries.", "Such productivity driven growth dynamics should lead to lower prices across a sizeable part of our economy.", "Obviously, this statement needs to be qualified.", "he Swiss economy will always remain vulnerable to developments abroad.", "A significant demand or supply shock to the global economy could reverse the beneficial impact on domestic prices of further domestic liberalization.", "For example, widespread protectionist measures rolling back the achievements of globalization or widespread geopolitical conflict and uncertainty would certainly threaten the broad achievements with regard to price stability.", "Nonetheless, breaking up the rigidities impeding competition in the domestically oriented sectors of our economy has every chance of rendering monetary policy not only more effective but also more flexible in its ability to focus its efforts beyond the primary mandate of maintaining price stability.", "Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook Let me now turn to a brief assessment of current economic conditions in the United States as well as here in Switzerland and conclude with a few comments regarding the outlook for Swiss monetary policy.", "Recent U.S. economic data confirms that GDP growth has accelerated rapidly in the second half of 2003.", "Third quarter U.S. GDP growth will be close to 6%.", "For the fourth quarter, most market participants expect GDP growth to slow to a still robust 4%.", "This would imply a U.S. growth rate of approximately 3.5% for 2003.", "Substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as strengthening financial conditions has supported the growth dynamic in the second half of 2003 in the United States.", "Expectations of moderating growth going forward are linked to the fact that stimulus from fiscal policy is set to shrink.", "The contribution to consumer spending from this year's tax cuts is set to decline gradually during 2004.", "In addition, further substantial increases in the defence budget are unlikely in the coming year, thus dampening the relative contribution to GDP from defence spending during 2004.", "The most worrying missing component of the U.S. recovery has been the absence of job creation which has led many market participants and media representatives to make reference to a \"jobless recovery\", or even a \"jobloss recovery\".", "With the September employment report which was released last week, we now have at least some evidence that labor markets in the U.S. are improving somewhat.", "Provided these numbers get confirmed in the months to come, it would add weight to the hypothesis that early at cyclical turning points, official payroll numbers underestimate the actual number of jobs created.", "At such times, the household survey statistics might be a more accurate gauge of labour market conditions.", "At least for now, the latest employment data has strengthened market expectations of a sustained recovery.", "On the business spending side, we have also seen some encouraging signs of a pick up in spending on capital equipment though it would appear that, so far, much of this demand is for replacement purposes rather than expansion.", "However, business inventories in the United States have fallen to low levels.", "Rising inventories should therefore contribute to production increases in the months to come.", "Without confirmation that a pick up in inventory spending and an expansion of the labour force complete the traditional pattern of a recovery cycle, market concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. expansion are bound to persist.", "Moreover, financial markets will continue to follow carefully the growing twin deficit in the U.S. and the potential risk it represents to global exchange rate stability.", "Finally, persistently high oil prices may add another element of caution with regard to the sustainability of the currently impressive growth dynamic in the United States.", "On the monetary side, Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly pointed out that despite firm consumer growth and gradually firming spending, there remains much slack in the U.S. economy.", "As it stated in its release of September 16, the Federal Open Market Committee therefore believes that pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted.", "Or, as Federal Reserve Governor Don Kohn stated a few days ago, \"it will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is underway of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment.", "\"13 Switzerland will undoubtedly benefit from the improved outlook in the United States.", "Unfortunately, apart from the lack of internal growth dynamic I discussed previously, Switzerland's growth prospective is further curtailed by economic developments in the rest of Europe where there is currently little evidence of a robust and sustainable upswing in economic activity.", "This is reflected in the fact that despite more favourable exchange rate conditions, Swiss exports during the second quarter declined again.", "While consumer spending had a stabilizing effect, investment also continued to decline.", "While the Swiss economy therefore remains weak, it is set to strengthen somewhat into the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004.", "Improved corporate expectations, a pick up in residential construction and strengthened financial conditions suggest that the trough of this cycle was reached during the second quarter of 2003.", "Provided the growth momentum in the U.S. sustains itself, exports should rise gradually, followed by an increase in equipment investment.", "Given considerable margin of slack in resource utilization, an improvement in the labour market can only be expected in the course of 2004.", "As we have indicated in our quarterly monetary policy assessment on September 18, the Swiss National Bank will continue to support the economy by conducting an accommodating monetary policy.", "Low interest rates - we continue to target our 3-month libor rate at 0.25% - are designed to keep Swiss franc investments unattractive.", "Despite a rapid expansion in our monetary aggregates which we monitor closely, price stability is currently not threatened.", "A rapid expansion of monetary aggregates does not automatically lead to higher inflation.", "In Switzerland, commentators often compare the current environment to the one in 1988, when money supply expansion rates were similar to what we observe today and inflation eventually rose to 6% by 1991.", "While understandable, the comparison is flawed.", "For one thing, current interest rates are significantly lower than they were at the time, thus reducing the opportunity cost of holding money to virtually zero.", "More importantly, the monetary expansion between 1986 and 1988 occurred against the backdrop of an unemployment rate of around 1%.", "A careful examination of the data of that period reveals that the margins of slack in resource utilization were rapidly declining at the time.", "Moreover, credit expanded dramatically during the late 1980s, thus providing a direct channel for the excess liquidity to find its way into excess demand.", "The current economic environment is a different one.", "Still adjusting from a historically unique speculative financial bubble, we currently observe an unemployment rate of close to 4% which markets expect to rise further in the months to come.", "In addition, virtually any measure of slack in resource utilization suggests that our current output gap is somewhere between 1.5% and 3%, thus indicating that it would take at least a year of significant above-trend growth before a balance would be reached between aggregate demand and potential supply.", "In conclusion, let me repeat what we have said after our last quarterly monetary policy assessment.", "In light of the underlying weakness of economic conditions in Switzerland, the risks pertaining to the sustainability of the welcome upswing in the United States and the benign global and domestic inflation outlook, we conduct our monetary policy with the aim of preventing a premature shift to a more restrictive monetary policy stance which could endanger the fragile upswing underway in Switzerland.", "Given the openness of our economy, exchange rate developments greatly affect monetary conditions in Switzerland.", "It therefore follows that our commitment to an expansionary monetary policy includes a firm commitment to fight against an unwelcome tightening of monetary conditions in the event of a marked appreciation of the Swiss franc.", "Global Price Development Consumer prices, unadjusted, change in % versus
