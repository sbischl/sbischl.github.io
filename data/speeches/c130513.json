data extends to information on the demand/supply dynamics related to new housing units.", "Estimates from the Bank's Research Department suggest that Trinidad and Tobago began this decade with a housing shortage overhang of around 50,000 units.", "With continued strong growth in annual housing demand and a significant slowdown in supply, the housing situation is likely to worsen in the

has entered the housing market through various means including through large scale programs for the construction of new houses (especially on prime agricultural lands), rent to own programs, national settlement programs such as squatter regularization, and providing highly subsidized mortgage and construction financing.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, it stands to reason that, if we are to make any meaningful dent in the acute national housing shortage, then we need to fundamentally rethink our national housing policy.", "What is the true extent of housing demand?", "How do we balance
