expectation was that rates would stay higher for longer than we had been used to in the previous ten years.", "A new strong-koruna policy.", "The high prices of imported commodities needed to be brought down.", "The strong koruna is also tightening monetary conditions for large firms, which were previously unaffected by the CNB's high rates because they were borrowing in euros.", "The

governors' speeches, presentations of papers by prominent academics form the backbone of the symposium.", "The theme this year was \"Structural Shifts in the Global Economy\".", "If you read all these papers, you'll be reminded of how monetary policies have gone from one extreme to the other in recent years: a long period of zero interest rates and growing central bank balance sheets (I describe the negative example of the Czech Republic in 2017 in Michl, 2023, and in the text below) was replaced by a rapid rise in rates.", "The switch from extremely low to extremely high rates has generated a variety of problems.", "The first extreme was zero interest rates.", "They induced growth in private and public debt.", "This issue was explored by Serkan Arslanalp (IMF) and Barry Eichengreen (University of California, Berkeley) in their paper \"Living with High Public Debt\".", "The main thesis in this paper is that the debts of advanced, emerging market and developing economies are not going to decline significantly for the foreseeable future.", "According to the authors, the world faces lower growth, ageing populations will necessitate higher spending on healthcare and pensions,

followers.", "This increases their market power and leads to less competition.", "Aggregate productivity in the economy is thus lower than when interest rates are at normal levels.", "The other

the euro area.", "The impacts on global trade are summarised by Alfaro and Chor (2023).", "It would be inappropriate for me to evaluate the polices of other central banks, but it would be a mistake not to critique the past policy of the CNB.", "The main problem in the Czech Republic was the rapid switch from one extreme to the other - from ultra-low rates and efforts to trigger inflation to ultra-high rates and efforts to rein inflation back in again.", "Everything comes at a cost.", "A rapid increase in rates doesn't always mean lower inflation in the future.", "You can't put right the mistakes made in past years in one fell swoop.", "This is discussed in the classical literature - see, for example, Friedman (1968) and Lucas (1976).", "The big lesson for me is that we will try not to repeat 2017 at the CNB.", "The interventions made at that time to weaken the koruna and raise inflation led within four months to an increase in the CNB's balance sheet, or rather in the banking
