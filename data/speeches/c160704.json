1930s, report lower willingness to take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the stock market, invest a lower fraction of their assets in equities, and are more pessimistic about future returns.", "Today, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people despite generalised economic prosperity.", "Across the advanced economies, employment appears less

concrete steps the Bank has taken to address uncertainty and how we can be expected to act in the weeks and months ahead.", ".1 Financial policy Let me begin with financial policy.", "The Bank of England realised long ago that banks had been woefully undercapitalised in the run-up to the crisis and needed to build significant resources in order to serve the real economy in a risky and uncertain world.", "The reforms have been enormous, with the capital requirements of our largest banks now ten times higher than before the crisis.", "Moreover, the Bank has stress tested our major banks and building societies against scenarios far more severe than the country currently faces.", "In fact, our 2015 stress test entailed losses twice those experienced during the financial crisis.", "At its last meeting in March, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) \"assessed the risks around the referendum [were] the most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability.\"", "Because we took the risks seriously in advance, the Bank could draw upon its supervisory expertise, its market operations, and its macroeconomic analysis to put in place a range of effective contingency plans.", "These measures reinforce the significant steps we have taken over the past several years to enhance the resilience of the financial system.", "As a result of all these actions, UK banks have raised over \u00a3130bn of capital, and now have more than \u00a3600bn of high quality liquid assets.", "And as a backstop, in order to support market functioning, the Bank of England continues to stand ready to provide more than \u00a3250bn of additional funds through its normal facilities.", "As a further precaution, reflecting the possibility that heightened uncertainty may last a while longer, today the Bank of England is announcing that it will continue to offer Indexed LongTerm Repo operations on a weekly basis until end-September 2016.", "This will provide additional flexibility in the Bank's provision of liquidity insurance over the coming months.", "These facilities provide an effective way for banks to manage their liquidity, with a competitive auction process, designed to encourage usage, but where at times some bids will go unfilled.", "We expect institutions to draw on this funding if and when appropriate, just as we expect them to draw on their own resources as needed in order to provide credit, support markets, and generally supply financial services to the real economy.", "In order to have confidence and plan for the future, financial institutions, like the rest of us, desire certainty.", "That is why the Bank will continue to be very clear about their regulatory framework.", "Our liquidity framework is now established and effective.", "Over the past year, the FPC has finalised the overall capital framework.", "We are steadily implementing measures to develop ring-fenced banks and to end the scourge of too-big-to-fail.", "Nothing in financial regulation has changed as a result of last week's referendum.", "It will not change until the process of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union is complete, until the UK is no longer a member of the EU and until EU law ceases to have effect in the UK.", "The Bank is continuing to implement the current regulatory framework until any new arrangements with the EU take effect.", "By enhancing the resilience of banks and by providing regulatory certainty so that firms can operate and plan with confidence, the Bank of England is ensuring that the financial system can continue to provide credit to businesses and households.", "This progress means that the financial system will dampen the aftershocks from recent events rather than amplify them.", "Next Tuesday, the independent FPC will release its biannual assessment of risks in its Financial Stability Report, and it will take any further actions it deems appropriate to support financial stability.", "Consistent with public accountability, we will then take questions from the media that day and will testify before Parliament the following week.", ".2 Monetary policy Let me now turn to monetary policy.", "In May, the Monetary Policy Committee set out its central outlook for steady growth accompanied by a gradual return of inflation to the target.", "As required by our remit, the MPC identified that the most significant risks to its forecast concerned the referendum.", "This was the view of all nine independent members of the MPC.", "In May, the MPC judged that a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target probably required a gradually rising path for Bank Rate over the next three years as growth picked up, jobs and wages increased and the drags from a stronger currency and lower commodity prices faded.", "As required by its remit, the MPC has already described how a vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for growth and inflation.", "As a result of increased uncertainty and tighter financial conditions, UK households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise.", "Through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy.", "At the same time, supply growth is likely to be lower over the next three years, reflecting slower capital accumulation and the need to reallocate resources across sectors of the economy.", "Both of these forces may be exacerbated by higher uncertainty and tighter financial conditions.", "Finally, as expected, sterling has depreciated sharply.", "For given foreign demand, this will mean support to net trade, though this may well be dampened by uncertainty around future trading relationships.", "A lower exchange rate will also entail higher prices for imported consumer goods, energy and capital goods, and consequently lower real incomes.", "As the MPC said prior to the referendum, the combination of these influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably higher path for inflation than set out in the May Inflation Report.", "In such circumstances, the MPC will face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and avoiding undue volatility in output and employment on the other.", "The implications for monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of these effects.", "In my view, and I am not pre-judging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer.", "The Committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July, and a full assessment complete with a new forecast will follow in the August Inflation Report.", "In August, we will also discuss further the range of instruments at our disposal.", "These judgments will benefit from the Bank's joined-up approach.", "For example, the PRA's direct line of sight of banks, building societies and insurers, and the FPC's oversight of systemic risks, allows the Bank to understand better the net impact of any monetary actions on financial conditions, and ultimately businesses and households.", "As we have seen elsewhere, if interest rates are too low (or negative), the hit to bank profitability could perversely reduce credit availability or even increase its overall price.", "There are also interactions between prudential rules and the provision of credit in the face of large macro uncertainty.", "The Bank of England is well positioned to understand these interactions and will work across its policy committees to maximise the coherence and effectiveness of their efforts.", "I can assure you that in the coming months the Bank can be expected to take whatever action is needed to support growth subject to inflation being projected to return to the target over an appropriate horizon, and inflation expectations remaining well anchored.", "Conclusion Above the central arch of this Court Room is a weather vane.", "Originally installed in 1805, it played a central role in the Bank's management of a different type of uncertainty - meteorological.", "When the wind blew from the east, ships would be able to travel up the Thames, meaning London's merchants would need credit to purchase the cargo.", "When it blew from the west, credit would need to be withdrawn.", "This Regency forecasting model helped the Bank of England to provide an anchor of stability.", "Today, while the economy is more complex and our models less reliable, the Bank has identified the clouds on the horizon and can see that the wind has now changed direction.", "Over the past few months, working closely with the Chancellor and with HM Treasury, we put in place contingency plans for the initial market shocks.", "Over the coming weeks, the Bank will consider a host of other measures and policies to promote monetary and financial stability.", "In short, the Bank of England has a plan to achieve our objectives, and by doing so support growth, jobs and wages during a time of considerable uncertainty.", "Part of that plan is ruthless truth telling.", "And one uncomfortable truth is that there are limits to what the Bank of England can do.", "In particular, monetary policy cannot immediately or fully offset the economic implications of a large, negative shock.", "The future potential of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not the gifts of monetary policymakers.", "These will be driven by much bigger decisions; by bigger plans that are being formulated by others.", "However, we will relentlessly pursue monetary and financial stability.", "And by doing so we will facilitate
