us, perhaps over lunch.", "Since the unveiling of the BSP's e-Rediscounting System in Manila in December 2006, then in Cebu City in March 2007, the banking industry and the business community have responded positively to this online, internet-based system.", "Indicative of their strong interest to participate, a total of 112 banks consisting of 21 commercial banks, 9 thrift banks and 82 rural

improve the credit access for exporters and small, medium, and micro-enterprises in this part of the country.", "These liberalized rediscounting guidelines, together with the requirement under the

System.", "The preparatory work for the paperless rediscounting scheme began in March 2006, with the issuance of BSP Circular No.", "Aligned with the objective of maintaining price stability, new

payments and generating account entries- all in less than 10 minutes.", "This paperless rediscounting facility allows banks to file or send loan applications and payments with the BSP on a real-time
