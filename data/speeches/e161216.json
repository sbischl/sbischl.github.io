demonstrated its resilience aftermath the global financial crises by delivering a strong average growth of 17.1% in 2008 to 2011, the latest development showed a moderation pace of growth with an average of 13.8% during 2011 to 2014, or in particular 10% for 2013 and 2014.", "Nevertheless, the first half of 2015 has posted a non-annualized upswing growth of 7.96% and therefore, global Islamic banking assets growth in 2015 is expected to once again sustain its double-digit rate.", "However, subdue global macroeconomic outlook poses considerable risks to global banking sector performance in general.", "Similar with the performance of Islamic banking sector, the global Sukuk market also experience a slowdown after reached record years for global Sukuk issuances in 2012 and 2013.", "In 2014 the Sukuk market slowed down to just over USD100 billion issuances, and the downward trend continue to 2015 where the issuance slides 43% to just around USD60 billion.", "The development of Islamic commercial finance in Indonesia has similar down trend as the development of global Islamic commercial, especially in 2012-2015, where the growth of Islamic banking reached its lowest of 8.8% annually in 2015, compare to 9.2% annually of its conventional counterpart.", "However, by July 2016, the growth of Islamic banking has rebounded to reach 12.0% y.o.y, while its conventional

finance sector comprises zakat, awqaf and non- profit microfinance institutions.", "Although development around Islamic social finance sector is not globally well documented, countries data indicates promising potential.", "Research by the Islamic Research and Training Institute of IDB (IRTI-IDB) shed some light for the development of global Islamic social finance.", "It is estimated that the potential zakat collection in South Asian and South East Asian countries is around USD30 billion in 2011, while in Sub-Saharan Africa countries it could reach around USD24 billion in 2013.", "On the other hand, the process of estimation of potential resources from awqaf is more challenging due to gross absence of data in most countries.", "The Islamic social finance allows the government to reach wider segment to entertain, particularly the low income society that have been neglected due to inability to provide low cost funds.", "Henceforth, it becomes our real challenge to better formulate and define the concept of Islamic economics to reach compatibility in both concept and implementation, so that it can be integrated in to the mainstream economic policy.", "In this international

institutions, orphanages, roads, graveyards, and religious establishment such as mosques.", "However, in the modern days, the institution of awqaf is encouraged to make awqaf either cash or estates more productive.", "Through awqaf, charitable clinics, medical centers, shopping complex and commercial centers can be established.", "This large social- commercial projects finance by the raising awqaf in a planned manner are considered as an important instruments to improve socio- economic wellbeing in a sustainable way.", "Unlike the other commercial sources of funds, the zakat funds would never cause unnecessary burden to the economy since the type of the funds is not commercially claimable, and hence, no excessive social costs will occur.", "The same also goes to the awqaf sector, where, as a matter of fact, more people are endowed with low cost assets.", "With this huge potential of zakat and awqaf land, we can expect Islamic social finance a significant drive to economic development.", "Both zakat and awqaf as Islamic social finance can become a buffer as well as an economic stabilizer.", "Zakat funds provide a transfer payment to the hardest hit poor and needy people caused by recession.", "Since zakat is a levy on both income and wealth, the redistribution of wealth will always be functional and operative in an Islamic economy due to wealth zakat irrespective of the phase of business cycle.", "Transfer payments to needy people will continue when the economy faces further recession.", "Due to its simple and certain collection and also religious obligations than just an involuntary tool of fetching wealth, zakat is always available in good time (peak) and bad time (recession).", "On the macroeconomic level, proportional zakat linked with income acts as an automatic stabilizer.", "When personal disposable income decreases due to recession, obligatory zakat also decreases.", "They do not have to pay the same proportional amount as before, thereby providing an automatic relief for income earners.", "On the contrary, when aggregate personal disposable income increases (boom period), more zakat is collected and more amount remains at the disposal of government to allocate as transfer payments.", "Thus zakat enables the distributive allocation works independently and help stabilize the extreme business cycles.", "As for awqaf, since the principal of awqaf will always increase from time to time, due to return of productive activities and new awqaf collection, awqaf could act as shock absorber of economic shocks.", "Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 22.", "Despite the potential, we also realize that in order to manage zakat and awqaf efficiently and prudently so that poverty alleviation and socio-economic wellbeing can be materialized, the regulatory framework of this sector has to be improved.", "To this end, Bank Indonesia jointly together with Islamic Research and Training Institute- Islamic Development Bank
