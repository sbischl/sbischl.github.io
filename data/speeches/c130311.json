mechanism, others more generally related to the greater interdependence of the financial system.", "The ongoing process of financial consolidation and the OTD model have produced intermediaries that are closely intertwined with the capital markets.", "This has had some important consequences for financial stability: a more connected world improves risk diversification and can make markets more resilient, but when contagion is actually set off, an interlinked financial system heightens the risk that it may spread more widely.", "But the negative perception of banking and finance should not

side of a more inclusive finance.", "On the other, financially literate citizens are better able to understand the efforts of regulators and policy makers to improve supervision and regulation, and less likely to subscribe to the simplistic view that \"finance is evil\".", "But we should realise that - as the case of Bernard Madoff and others in the US and elsewhere clearly show - this is no panacea (Madoff's customers were surely much better educated than average).", "Therefore, for purposes of consumer protection in the financial services industry, financial regulation and good supervision are the necessary complements to financial education and inclusion.", "Complexity was also used, somewhat perversely, as an argument in favour of a sort of benign neglect on the part of regulators.", "The big financial players argued successfully that financial innovation was too complex and too opaque for the regulators to get their heads around.", "Indeed, they said, to safeguard the international financial system from systemic risk, the main priority was promoting an \"industry-led\" effort to improve internal risk management and related systems.", "This, in a nutshell, was the view espoused by the Group of Thirty report following the outbreak of the Asian crisis.", "But this thesis was often accompanied by the argument to the effect that \"you, regulators and

ability, or the right incentives to acquire the necessary information, for two reasons.", "First, the big financial players are global, and national regulators had powers too narrow to be able to confront them.", "The difficulties in coordinating the regulators' actions, in the face of a natural tendency to preserve each one's particular sphere of influence, was a powerful drag on the ability to rise to the challenge posed by a finance gone global.", "Second, the phenomenon of regulatory capture was a definite reality.", "Powerful political and economic influences were at play, and in some cases prevailed.", "Accepting the idea that benign neglect was the right course of action was, however, a critical mistake.", "The global financial crisis has highlighted the limits of the idea that self-regulation and market discipline are sufficient to ensure stable financial systems.", "Financial regulation and supervision have to keep pace with developments in the financial industry.", "National authorities need to be aware of the risk that their powers become narrow compared to the sphere of influence of the global financial players; the coordination of financial supervision across borders and across sectors is a key condition for the stability of the global financial system.", "More importantly, regulators and supervisors have to pay attention to keeping financial industry lobbies at due distance.", "All this calls for a major effort, at a national but especially at an international level, to adjust and strengthen the regulatory and supervisory financial framework.", "And it explains why the work that is carried out at various levels of relevance and responsibility in international fora is so important.", "In what follows I will review and assess recent reforms in financial regulation, highlighting those improvements that still need to be achieved.", "I will also discuss the importance of advances in our analytical understanding of the workings of financial markets and of its deviations from stationarity.", "In search of a better regulatory and supervisory regime Over the last few years the crisis has heightened appreciation of the benefits of a more stringent regulatory regime.", "At an international level, under the political impulse of the G-20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) have introduced substantial regulatory changes to reduce the frequency of financial crises and increase the resilience of economic systems.", "Much has been already achieved.", "The quantity and quality of capital that banks need to hold has been significantly enhanced to ensure that they operate on a safe and sound basis.", "Minimum capital requirements have been raised.", "The improvement in the quality of capital aims to ensure that banks are better able to absorb losses on both a going concern and a gone concern basis.", "The risk coverage has been increased, in particular for trading activities, securitisations and exposures related to off-balance sheet vehicles and arising from derivatives.", "An internationally harmonised maximum leverage ratio is going to be introduced, to serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital measure and to contain the build-up of excessive leverage in the system.", "The BCBS has also introduced international standards for bank liquidity and funding, designed to promote the resilience of banks to liquidity shocks.", "A milestone agreement was recently reached among Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision to adopt a minimum requirement for the ratio between high quality liquid assets and net liquidity outflows that banks would face over a one-month horizon in stress conditions (Liquidity Coverage Ratio - LCR).", "The minimum LCR will increase gradually in the coming years, so as to ensure that the new liquidity standard will not hinder the ability of the global banking system to finance recovery.", "And countries with distressed banking systems will have flexibility in its application.", "At the behest of the G-20, the FSB has promoted initiatives to strengthen the regulation of the OTC derivatives market.", "The aim is to reinforce market infrastructures, in order to minimise contagion and spill-over effects among players that have become more and more interconnected.", "These initiatives increase market transparency through a number of measures: contract standardization, the requirement to trade on regulated markets, settlement through central counterparties, the reporting of the terms and conditions of transactions to trade repositories.", "But further progress is needed in important areas.", "Capital and liquidity regulation must be accompanied by improvements in internal risk control arrangements and by actions aimed at correcting incentives to excessive risk-taking.", "Board members and senior managers should possess a thorough understanding of the bank's overall operational structure and risks.", "It is also fundamental that supervisors regularly assess banks' corporate governance policies and practices.", "Compensation policies also need to be revised, in order to better align remuneration with risk-adjusted long-term performance and avoid excessive risk-taking and short-termism.", "In particular, when designing compensation policies, banks should take into account a number of issues: the variable portion of the compensation of risk takers must be paid on the basis of individual, business-unit and firm-wide measures that adequately assess risk-adjusted performance; bonuses must reward the achievement of stable earnings, not simply the fruit of extraordinary operations; executives' severance packages too must be clearly and effectively bound to the results attained, and reflect a more general evaluation of the manager's performance; compensation must be deferred long enough to validate the true quality of management.", "The debate that has started with the so-called Volcker rule on the organizational structure of banks and the need to separate traditional credit business from activity in the financial field has been recently reinvigorated at a European level by the reports of the Vickers Commission in the United Kingdom and the Liikanen Group for the European Commission.", "Both the Volcker rule and the reports call for a much needed discussion around business size and complexity in the financial sector; the experience of the crisis has indeed shown that we should not be shy to thoroughly re-assess relative merits and costs of both (size and complexity).", "These reports trace out possible lines of intervention.", "Protecting retail deposits and taxpayers' money from the risks implicit in trading activities (what used to be called \"speculation\") - the rationale behind these proposals - is crucial.", "The experience of the crisis has shown that, even if no specific business model has performed particularly well or poorly, the banks' organizational structure has an impact on the propensity of managers to engage in excessively risky activities.", "We should recognize that both retail and investment banking, even if organizationally or institutionally separate, should be properly regulated, and should be careful not to have a too ample definition of market making activity.", "At all events, in today's globalized world it is crucial to make sure that countries cooperate and agree on the appropriate stringency of financial regulation.", "Countries should not compete by relaxing rules in order to attract financial intermediaries, as this generates negative externalities for other countries.", "This is a most delicate issue, and while a perfectly level playing field may not be achievable, we have to be conscious of the consequences of a \"beggar-thy-neighbour\" approach to regulation.", "The transition to a uniform system of rules and oversight of the financial sector must be hastened.",

set of global accounting standards; but much remains to be done.", "The International Accounting Standards Board and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board expect to make progress on the two key outstanding issues of impairment of loans, where their deliberations should be completed by the end of the year, and insurance contracts, where both Boards will be holding public consultations this year.", "Of these two outstanding issues, the need for convergence on a new forward-looking expected loss approach to provisioning is of most immediate concern for end-users and from a financial stability perspective.", "One element that is essential for guaranteeing systemic stability is the method of measuring risk-weighted assets (RWA), the denominator of capital adequacy ratios.", "RWA measures have recently attracted increasing attention from market analysts, banks and supervisory authorities.", "It has been argued - and this seems to be actually the case - that the methodologies for computing RWAs may not be comparable across institutions and, especially, across jurisdictions, and that they should more properly reflect risk in order to avoid ultimately jeopardising financial stability.", "These problems highlight the relevance of supervisory practices in determining banks' capital requirements (for example, in validating internal banks' models for calculating risk weights).", "Here, rigorous micro-prudential supervision is essential.", "We really need to work out a single rulebook, to move with determination towards taking joint responsibility and using peer reviews as much as possible in our supervisory activity.", "As for the initiatives to strengthen the regulation of the OTC derivatives market, these complex reforms are taking somewhat longer than originally planned.", "It is therefore necessary to pick up the pace, overcoming the difficulties of implementation and the industry's resistance.", "Authorities must make all efforts to remove the uncertainties arising when transactions involve a cross-border dimension, which is a recurrent condition in a global market.", "This is necessary to pre-empt regulatory arbitrage and, ultimately, to achieve the G20 objectives.", "Work is also in progress on other relevant issues at an international level (capital requirements for exposures to central counterparties, margining standards for noncentrally cleared transactions, guidance on resolution of central counterparties, as well as on authorities' access to trade repository data) and at a regional and national level.", "In Europe, at the end of next week a comprehensive set of standards for the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation will enter into force, complementing the European legal framework for the so-called \"clearing obligation\" embodied in the G20 statement of September 2009.", "From a global perspective, however, the regulatory effort needs to be carried out by the widest range of jurisdictions as made clear at the recent G20 meeting in Moscow.", "Significant efforts are also expected from the industry.", "The last FSB report on the implementation of the OTC derivatives market reform estimates that \"approximately 10 per cent of outstanding credit default swaps and approximately 40 per cent of outstanding interest rates derivatives had been centrally cleared as of end-August 2012\".", "These shares should grow rapidly, so as to leave to customized OTC derivatives the sole purpose of meeting the specific hedging needs of financial and non financial counterparts which cannot be met by standardised, clearing-eligible contracts.", "It will be crucial to ensure that stricter regulation and supervision of banks will not push banklike activities and risks towards non - or less - regulated institutions (the so-called \"shadow banking\" sector).", "Let us not forget that the financial crisis originated in the US securitization market, largely populated by unregulated or scantily regulated operators.", "While we have to address bank-like risks to financial stability emerging from outside the regular banking system, the approach should be proportionate, focussed on those activities that are material to the system, using as a starting point those that were a source of risk during the crisis.", "The FSB is currently refining the set of recommendations issued in November of last year.", "One should bear in mind, however, that the new recommendations will be able to address the specific risks that arose during the crisis, and we all recognise the ability of the shadow banking sector to innovate.", "Although new regulations on systemically important financial institutions have recently been approved, the \"too-big-to-fail\" issue is still a major concern, and it merits strict monitoring.", "Some progress is being made in developing and testing methodology for the identification of global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), and in developing appropriate supervision guidelines.", "An identification methodology for all non-bank financial institutions of global systemic relevance is also under preparation.", "For banking institutions (G-SIFI) the implementation of the framework recently agreed upon has much farther to go; we need to rapidly move forward.", "Negative externalities associated with banks' behaviour (especially for large, interconnected financial firms) must be taken into account.", "A broad consensus has emerged on the idea that \"macroprudential\" policies directed towards preserving financial stability should limit systemic risk by addressing both the cross-sectional dimension of the financial system, with the aim of strengthening its resilience to adverse real or financial shocks, and its temporal dimension, to contain the accumulation of risk over the business or financial cycle.", "Moreover, given the complementarity between macroeconomic stability and financial stability, and that between the instruments to pursue them, the exchange of information and the co-ordination between macroprudential and monetary authorities are crucial to counter at the same time the risks for price stability and the systemic risks for financial stability.", "I would dare to say that proper understanding of how this can be effectively achieved is still in the making.", "Finally, even after the completion of the regulatory overhaul, it would be foolish to pretend that defaults can always be avoided.", "They may be the result of imprudent behaviour or of fraudulent operations.", "We need to be prepared for their occurrence, as the costs of public support tend to be very high.", "According to the latest data gathered by the European Commission, the outstanding amount of public recapitalizations as of June 2012 came to 0.1 per cent of GDP in France, 1.8 in Germany, 2.0 in Spain, 4.2 in the UK, 4.3 in Belgium, 5.2 per cent in the Netherlands, and over 40 per cent in Ireland.", "For Spain and Ireland these amounts are at their highest since 2008, in the other countries they are lower than the peaks reached in 2009.", "For the Spanish banks, a programme of recapitalization using European funds of up to \u20ac100 billion was authorized in July, of which \u20ac41 billion (3.9 per cent of GDP) has already been disbursed.", "In Italy, even taking into consideration the public support provided last month to the Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, public recapitalizations have been limited to 0.3 per cent of GDP.", "These figures indicate that the ongoing work on resolution regimes is very important in this regard, and rapid progress should definitely be made.", "This is particularly relevant in the euro area, where the new single supervisor mechanism (the SSM) is being implemented.", "Observations on the analytical implications of economic and financial instability Economic systems constantly evolve and transform.", "Changes in institutional arrangements, technological innovation and revisions in economic policy paradigms continuously reshape the framework in which economic agents (consumers and businesses) make their decisions.", "This in turn leads to changes in economic agents' behavioural patterns.", "When there is marked discontinuity with the past, such changes may be far-reaching and the past fails to provide enough guidance for the present (never mind the future).", "We should always remember that the financial system is part of a richer social, economic and political environment.", "The real world is subject to shocks that at times may have dramatic consequences, such as those that we have experienced in the last twenty years or so, with the end of the cold war, globalization and the sudden emergence of new major economic actors, the ICT revolution, and substantial (not completely anticipated) demographic changes.", "However, a stationarity assumption of sorts underpins our theoretical and statistical models, in the case of economic forecasting and (macro) policy making as well as in the case of financial analysis and risk management.", "In general, the basic tenet is that future outcomes will be drawn from the same population that generated past outcomes, so that the time average of future outcomes cannot be persistently different from averages calculated from past observations and future events can be predicted with a certain degree of statistical accuracy.", "In non-ergodic environments, on the contrary, at least some economic processes are such that expectations based on past probability distribution functions can differ persistently from the time averages that will be generated as the future unfolds.", "In case of acute uncertainty, no analysis of past data can provide reliable signals regarding future prospects.", "The challenges posed by the non-ergodic nature of economic systems may be met by recognizing that our models are by necessity \"local\" approximations of very complex economic and financial developments.", "One needs to be modest, using theory and empirical models as starting points for, not straightjackets in, our decision making.", "And perhaps not enough attention has been paid by the financial community to the need for establishing institutional and behavioural norms to reign on patterns of instability and developing proper learning devices to deal with major shocks and regime changes.", "These challenges are compounded by another general characteristic of the quantitative analysis of economic phenomena: the difficulty of running parallel worlds, i.e.", "producing data through experiments designed and controlled by the researcher.", "Even when economic forces do follow repetitive patterns, it may not be easy to spot empirical regularities, because contingencies - especially the exceptional ones - cannot be re-created at will, in the laboratory, for cognitive purposes.", "Our experience will always be limited, partial and episodic.", "These aspects are not always taken into account in economics or finance.", "As Charles Kindleberger noticed: \"For historians each event is unique.", "Economics, however, maintains that forces in society and nature behave in repetitive ways\".", "Why is it that the parameters and laws governing economic systems tend to change over time?", "A distinction can be made between exogenous uncertainty, when an individual's actions do not affect the probability of an event occurring, and endogenous (or behavioural) uncertainty, when they do.", "In economic systems, this second type of uncertainty can be particularly important.", "This has not been sufficiently recognized, I believe, in the way (applied) macroeconomics and finance have evolved since the 1980s, with the ascendency of the rational expectations revolution in the former and the efficient market hypothesis in the latter.", "In macroeconomics this may have led to placing too much faith in the ability of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models to represent or sufficiently approximate the real world on which economic policy is applied.", "These fundamentally linear models are the result of the intertemporal optimization by representative agents of objective functions under conditions of uncertainty, given technological and budget constraints and the \"rationality\" of their expectations (i.e.", "perfect foresight barring a random error).", "Indeed, going beyond the assumption that society and nature always behave uniformly and consistently over time has deep implications in policy making as well.", "This can be easily seen in monetary policy, where no mechanistic use of forecasting models can be made if one allows for the possibility of structural changes.", "An important lesson of the financial crisis - one that is generating substantial research activity - is that the interactions and feedbacks between the real and the financial sectors and the non-linearities that emerge especially during crises are not adequately captured by the available models.", "Many of the effects associated with financial and asset price imbalances are likely to be highly non-linear and complex.", "The reaction of monetary policy should then also be non-linear and it should respond to asset price misalignments and financial imbalances.", "When the probability of a crisis becomes non-trivial, the interest rate path towards ensuring monetary stability might be different than in ordinary circumstances.", "These aspects were not well captured in the empirical models used to support monetary policy decisions, something understood but perhaps not adequately recognized in discussions on flexible inflation targeting frameworks that took place a decade or so ago.", "One of my preferred quotes is from Herbert Simon:12 Good predictions have two requisites that are often hard to come by.", "First they require either a theoretical understanding of the phenomena to be predicted, as a basis for the prediction model, or phenomena that are sufficiently regular that they can be simply extrapolated.", "Since the latter condition is seldom satisfied by data about human affairs (or even by the weather), our predictions will generally be only as good as our theories.", "The second requisite for prediction is having reliable data about the initial conditions - the starting point from which the extrapolation is to be made.", "I.

signs of structural discontinuity, the benefits of correct forecasting are greatest.", "Indeed, anomalous observations that do not fit the main mechanisms at work in the historical period used for statistical estimates are frequently put aside (\"dummied-out\"), their information content is neutralized.", "This is reasonable, as episodic observations of exceptional phenomena are generally inadequate to capture complex inter-relations between economic and financial variables.", "And yet those very deviations from the norm may contain precious information on how the economy works in conditions other than those usually prevailing.", "Much of the same reasoning applies to the analysis of financial market developments.", "The wave of financial innovation in the last two decades was fuelled by the idea, in principle correct and fruitful, that the proliferation of new (and complex) financial instruments, allowing agents to insure against many dimensions of risk, was a way to \"complete the markets\", to get closer to the theoretical Arrow-Debreu world, enabling investors to transfer resources efficiently across time, space and states of the world.", "But this idea relied on the presumption that the world is basically stationary, that the future is pretty much the same as the past, that we can extrapolate from relatively small samples, and that there is a single \"data generating process\" that we can identify and understand.", "But we know that the real world is more complicated.", "The determinants of asset prices are not fixed, but vary over time.", "Asset returns do not follow a normal distribution, as it is assumed by conventional valuation formulas.", "Myopic behaviour, herding and other types of distorted incentives on the part of individuals and

enhanced role to psychological elements and the recognition that there are limits to what one can know.", "In the field of the so-called behavioural finance this may even go as far as to validate \"irrational\" actions.", "And eminent economists argue that these elements play a role in explaining both conservative attitudes and speculative bubbles.", "The potential limitations of quantitative analysis are therefore not limited to macroeconomics, econometric modelling and forecasting but also apply to finance.", "And they may have dire consequences.", "The case of the CDOs is instructive.", "These credit derivatives, that in the first half of the last decade recorded an impressive growth, were priced according to valuation models whose results were very sensitive to modest imprecision in parameter estimates and highly exposed to systemic risk (i.e.", "strongly affected by the performance of the economy as a whole).", "As a result, CDOs not only did not increase the risk bearing capacity of the economies, but their implosion between mid-2007 and mid-2008 was at the core of the global financial crisis.", "Innovative financial instruments with unsound theoretical foundations may exacerbate negative externalities and be sources of instability in their own right.", "Rather than in the development of unlikely \"catch-all\" models, the key to tackling the problems created by discontinuity must lie, first of all, in a better understanding of its nature and so in defining models in which the relations are based on parameters that remain stable in the long term.", "Research must therefore aim to identify sufficiently fundamental and reasonably dependable mechanisms that do not change over time.", "To provide sensible accounts of rational choices, quantitative models necessarily have to focus on systematic factors, and draw their own conclusions on the basis of key relations.", "In this respect it is worth recalling Bruno De Finetti's argument for a \"theory of finance\", made as early as In order for a theory of behaviour to say something, it must necessarily be restricted to that which is derived as the consequence of a few main concepts and criteria and which can accordingly (if somewhat arbitrarily) be defined as \"rational behaviour\".", "Then the theory will set out conclusions that are valid in the absence of accessory factors.", "This is not to deny or downplay the possible presence or importance of such factors; only, it is preferable to shift the study of deviations from the \"theoretical\" behaviour implied by those conclusions to a later moment and to the detailed plane of complementary observations, rather than cloud all distinctions in a single theoretical construct which, in the attempt to embrace and set on an equal plane the congeries of systematic and accessory factors, would be reduced to a non-theory suitable solely to conclude that all kinds of behaviour are equally possible (for caprice or madness, even, as is in fact the case).", "Obviously, De Finetti's \"later moment\" should not be overlooked in applied research.", "Against the risk that the theoretical paradigms underlying the approximation of reality implicit in a model may prove particularly inadequate in certain situations, it is useful to employ a battery of different models and cross-checks.", "This \"multi-pronged\" approach to modelling and forecasting also makes it possible to more effectively filter and interpret the great mass of partial and fragmentary or even contradictory data that gradually become available.", "But in dealing with non-ergodic processes, what really is all the more essential is to integrate the signals provided by quantitative models with information outside the models, take stock of related historical experience in its entirety, and intervene on the basis of both theory and good sense.", "In both empirical microeconomics and finance work is under way to deal with the issues that have been considered here.", "Deviations from the assumption of normal distributions, \"fat tails\" and the modelling of extreme events are being taken into account both in research and applications.", "And it should be recognized that the importance of human behaviour does not imply that economic systems necessarily have to be prone to instability.", "In fact, the very existence of behavioural uncertainty may tend to create a set of institutions, as well as conventions and habits, which help to deal with the problems highlighted in Keynes' \"beauty context\" example and ensure the stability of the main economic processes, as emphasized by Herbert Simon.", "Still, I believe, more attention should be paid to how to account for learning in the crucial adjustment periods that follow extreme events that cannot be simply taken as random extractions from a stable, even if non-normal, probability distribution.", "Widening the class of probability distributions remains however, for the time being, the practical response to phenomena such as the ones we have been dealing with in this difficult period.", "The crisis has shown that benign neglect should never have been an option.", "It has called for a major overhaul of the regulatory and supervisory financial framework, especially at an international level.", "In a globalized financial marketplace, with large and powerful participants, individual action by national authorities would be bound to fail.", "By the same token, the boundaries of supervision should be widened to encompass all relevant intermediaries, regardless of the specific industry sector they belong to.", "I have discussed the work underway, highlighted the results achieved and stressed the areas where more effort is needed.", "The correct conduct of credit and financial business also requires competence and good faith on the part of intermediaries, both factors being decisive to ensure sound and prudent management and preserve the confidence of savers.", "This necessity is heightened by the complexity of the external environment, by the presence of large intermediaries, and by the economic and reputational damage that can result from illicit behaviour.", "No market can function without rules, nor is prudent management possible without correct conduct, embodied not only in scrupulous compliance with the law and the supervisory rules but also in complete adherence to business ethics.", "The dramatic events of the past five years have highlighted the limitations of modelling and quantitative analysis in finance and in economics.", "The common assumption of stationarity is at odds with the unpredictably changeable nature of the real world.", "This is not to say that all the analytical efforts of the past and the progress achieved should be disregarded.", "It means rather that in order to make the best out of them one needs to remember that models are by necessity \"local\" approximations to very complex phenomena and they should be used with good sense as a framework, not a straightjacket, for our decision-making.", "Quantitative analysis and modelling can also help to establish institutional and behavioural norms to rein in patterns of instability and developing proper learning devices to deal with major shocks and regime changes.", "In turn, models should take into account the impact of such norms on economic developments.", "Central banks have a crucial role to play.", "There are clear complementarities between financial and monetary stability.", "Sometimes these are formally recognized in their official mandate, but even when this is not the case, central banks must take them into account in their policy decisions.", "In this respect, I would like to quote from a book by the brilliant Bank of Italy economist Curzio Giannini, who passed away prematurely about ten years ago.", "In that \"beautifully written and illuminating\" work, as Charles Goodhart describes it in his foreword, Curzio clearly saw the likely consequences of financial developments, and concluded:17 In the years to come, the most interesting developments will probably be precisely in the sphere of supervision and regulation.", "[...] Whatever its detractors may say, the central bank has no need to move into new lines of business.", "Capitalism generated the central bank and capitalism will come to it again, even if the current infatuation with the financial markets' self-regulating capacity were to endure.", "[...] The central bank produces an intangible but essential good - trust - of which capitalism (based as it is on a pyramid of paper if not mere electronic signals) has an immense need.", "We must not forget that trust, or its synonym \"confidence\", derives from the Latin fides, meaning faith, which cannot be produced simply by contract.", "In fact the legitimacy of central banks does not lie in their policy activism, or the ability to generate income, or even, save in a highly indirect sense, their efficiency.", "Rather, [...] it derives from competence, moderation, the long-term approach, and the refusal to take any tasks beyond their primary role.", "If, as I am sure, there is another phase in the development of central banking, it will spring from these values.", "In the end this is, perhaps, what society should expect, if not from the financial sector, from those who are called to look after financial stability."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
