discussion, let me refer to some prominent symptoms.", "Thai labor supply has started to gradually decrease due to the trend of aging society.", "Research has shown that increasing labor supply by

complex issues benefit from the sharing of ideas.", "However, let me now move to issues within the direct mandate of the Bank of Thailand.", "Although less often mentioned, the Bank of Thailand's roles in lifting growth potential still exist.", "Two roles are worth mentioning.", "Firstly, the role of maintaining economic stability that I described earlier in this talk, as stability is a prerequisite to structural changes that lift productivity.", "Secondly, the developmental role, a form of supply-side policies, to enhance financial sector efficiency and create a favorable financial environment for investment that would lead to higher productivity growth.", "The importance of financial markets has long been realized by the Bank of Thailand as being the crucial part of growth potential.", "Indeed, our annual economic symposium this year, \"Rethinking Finance for Sustainable Growth\", will discuss the links in detail.", "A healthy financial market can distribute funds to

growth, moving them to those with better prospects.", "The growth prospects will be realized, and in aggregate will improve the whole economy's growth potential.", "A well-developed financial market

phase, Financial Sector Master Plan Phase 3.", "In addition to Financial Sector Master Plan, the Bank of Thailand also encourages Thai companies and depositors to diversify their investments and promote financial market development through the implementation of Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan.", "As a result, there is increase in the number of Thai companies doing outward Foreign Direct Investment which allows capital as well as resources to be allocated more efficiently.", "At this point, it is important to note that resources and infrastructure built by the government and central bank are not sufficient in themselves to lift the economy's growth potential.", "More importantly, financial institutions and businesses must utilize them and act as the main player that will drive the economy to its highest potential.", "Therefore, cooperation of financial and business sectors is vital for lifting growth potential.", "The private sector needs to add more value to products and services by having long run commitment and investing in both physical and human capital, for example, high technology machinery, employee training as well as research and development.", "In order
