high oil prices, the diversion of agricultural lands to ethanol, climate change etc).", "(ii) Insufficiency of domestic agricultural production (and persistent crop damage resulting from floods).", "(iii) Our expansionary fiscal stance as we seek to pursue rapid development and to relieve the constraints being posed by declining spare capacity (iv) Rapid bank credit expansion, fuelled by buoyant liquidity conditions; and (v) High inflation expectations (which has become a major issue).", "In terms of policy responses, during the fiscal year ended September 2008, while fiscal policy may have resulted in a larger overall surplus, permitting an increase in transfers to the HSF, it made little dent in the non-energy fiscal deficit which currently stands at 14.7 per cent of GDP.", "(The report tries to explain why the non-energy fiscal deficit is important from the standpoint of inflationary pressure).", "Throughout 2008, the Central Bank has sought to maintain a restrictive monetary stance, utilizing all the instruments in its arsenal - special sterilization bonds, open market instruments, reserve requirements, the repo rate - with mixed results.", "All these measures tend to result in higher interest rates, which can affect business activity, in particular small businesses (which could be a problem) and mortgage rates (which could cause severe hardships, including for people who can least afford).", "The message here is that excessive dependence on monetary policy to deal with inflation carries real risks and that the only way of reducing inflation, without severe consequences for interest rates is by having a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy i.e.", "sharing the burden between the government and the private sector.", "What are the short term prospects?", "To say the least the current international crisis and in particular, the steady decline in energy prices, are giving rise to much uncertainty in our domestic economy.", "This nervousness is being reflected in several ways: An incipient recovery in the stock market has petered out and as in the US, investors are now playing safe.", "Businesses are now becoming quite concerned about the cost funding, about the impact of any budget adjustments on domestic demand, and about declining export demand in CARICOM.", "There are clear signs that the real estate market is softening (that's a good thing) and that housing construction activity may have peaked (both in the public and private sector);
