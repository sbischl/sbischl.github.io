that is, a positive vision of what our economy will look like after.", "Our economies are entering an inevitable phase of transformation, but if policymakers can demonstrate that we will emerge together from the crisis stronger - with more agile, more modern and more equal economies than before - we can ensure a more resilient recovery today and more sustainable growth in the future.", "Uncertainty in euro area economy The crisis is weighing heavily on the euro area economy.", "Business investment looks to have collapsed in the first quarter, even more strongly than GDP.", "Measures of consumers' propensity to save have surged to historical levels, far above what we saw after the Lehman crash.", "Some of this reflects \"forced saving\" because people have been unable to spend and will therefore reverse naturally.", "But we are also seeing significant precautionary saving, which is a sign that households are preparing for an uncertain future, and uncertainty is likewise a key factor in weak business investment.", "There are two main sources of uncertainty today.", "The first source is uncertainty about how the economy will recover from the coronavirus (COVID19), which is evident in the Eurosystem's latest macroeconomic projections.", "Our baseline projection sees GDP falling by 8.7% this year, but this is surrounded by a wide range of potential scenarios.", "In our mild scenario, the drop in GDP would be 5.9% this year, and in our severe scenario it would be 12.6%.", "In this latter case, output would still be well below its pre-crisis level at the end of 2022.", "Faced with such an outlook, it is understandable that households are anxious about their future incomes and firms are hesitant about making irreversible decisions.", "In particular, many citizens fear that, in a slow recovery, some jobs will be lost once government support schemes are phased out.", "This underlines why it is so important that the recovery is properly managed and that the economy is adequately stimulated.", "Confidence in government policies is critical to reducing uncertainty, which is itself a form of stimulus.", "In fact, results of a survey conducted at the ECB show that households that assess government policies as adequate have lower uncertainty about their future income.", "The second source is uncertainty about how the economy will change in response to COVID-19.", "It is becoming increasingly clear that the crisis will restructure our economies in fundamental ways.", "In the manufacturing sector, we are likely to see a push to make supply chains more resilient, which will likely lead to a greater focus on \"proximity\", i.e.", "on-shoring of production and reinforcing of strategic value chains.", "In the services sectors, by contrast, the pandemic is likely to shift the economy towards more \"distancing\" via more digitalisation.", "We are already seeing this transition accelerate as retail trade gravitates towards e-commerce, services that we previously thought were \"non-tradeable\" start being traded online, and more remote working becomes possible.", "As the workplace changes profoundly, it will take time for the new equilibrium in the economy to appear.", "Some sectors will grow and create more jobs as their reach increases -

Italy among them - mobilising investment requires above all a business-friendly economic environment, with efficient and agile public and private services, adequate physical and digital infrastructures, a well-functioning judicial system and a strong financial sector.", "If such actions are taken, this crisis can engender a period of positive transformation.", "It offers an opportunity to policymakers to take a decisive step forward towards more inclusive, greener and more digital growth.", "A renewed focus on the digital economy, for example, can help break the negative feedback loop we see in Europe between fragmented markets, low economies of scale and weak investment in digital capacities, which has at times resulted in the knowledge economy in the euro area contributing only about half as much to productivity growth as in the United States.", "Greater digitalisation would in turn help accelerate the shift in Europe towards what the economist Carlota Perez has termed \"smart green growth\", which is not only about renewables and sustainable goods, but also about innovation in the productivity of resources and the shift from tangibles to intangibles.", "Europe already hosts the largest eco-innovation and circular economy industry in the world and the euro is the currency of choice for global green bond issuance.", "In the twentieth century, Europe was also at the forefront of the creation of the welfare state.", "The crisis today offers a possibility to consolidate and expand our global leadership on the environmental front and to make it converge with more digital lifestyles -
