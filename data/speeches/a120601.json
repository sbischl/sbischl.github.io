and offered as well as the organizational structure and management practices of financial institutions.", "Thirty years ago commercial banks were primarily and basically anchored in intermediation -

and emerging new competitors have dramatically changed the way banks now do business.", "Banks have now not only grown larger but have become much more complex and now span across the globe.", "The advancements in information technology in particular have allowed banks to handle a phenomenal amount of data at alarming speed thus propelling the introduction of new products and services.", "Three decades ago, bank failure was not a frequently mentioned financial jargon unlike today where bank failure is discussed at almost every financial fora and where the collapse of one bank could trigger a domino effect across many countries simultaneously.", "The rapid demise of banks which were thought of being too big to fail given the unquestionable caliber of those at helm are now tumbling, and

regional central banks and monetary authorities.", "It has established technical working groups to address inter alia consolidated supervision, crisis management and Basle requirements and has put in

several countries and I am aware that yesterday three supervisory colleges were held.", "Much emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the banking sector remains safe and sound, however, there are
