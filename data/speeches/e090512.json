excessive leverage, complexity and risk-taking incentivised by inappropriate compensation systems; pro-cyclical regulatory requirements and inappropriate cost of capital; the flawed originate-to-distribute model in credit origination that worsened the principal-agent problem; the role of rating agencies; and the use of instruments such as CDS and CDOs that were supposed to distribute risks more broadly but ended up concealing and concentrating risks instead.", "Each of these plays a role but if we are to identify a common factor across these various causes it is this: that finance has become detached from economic realities.", "As we look to develop our financial system, we have to bear in mind that the basic role of finance is to allocate scarce capital to its most productive use.", "We earn a return only if the capital is deployed to eventually produce goods and services that are valued by the market.", "When the nexus between the mobilization of capital and the productive use of capital is broken, the returns cannot be sustained -
