why do people take these results \"for granted,\" as something which will be sustained of itself, regardless of how we behave?", "Why do they believe that we can keep on disregarding external and internal influences without bearing any consequences?", "And, especially when we all know that our doings were due to frequent elections.", "Why must \"bad times\" return before people understand that present times were good, only we failed to make the best of them?!", "Macroeconomic stability in Serbia will continue to hinge on the following key factors: 1.", "Movements in global money and capital markets leave no room for doubt: the situation is bad, and, for the time being, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.", "Capital markets worldwide are swayed by unprecedented turbulences and money remains expensive despite \u0430) government interventions worth thousands of billions of euros and b) policy rate cuts and cash injections by central banks.", "At the same time, the banking system faces a number of serious challenges, such as: \u0430) capital adequacy, which governments are now acting to improve and hence acquire a significant ownership in the banking system, b) the dilemma of whether to continue lending to clients now that banks are no longer able to borrow in the financial market, and c) the question of market valuation of assets when there is simply no market for specific services and products.", "In light of the above, it is much less likely that banks will continue to generously \"pump\" money into our region or approve cross-border loans.", "In current circumstances, it would certainly be very useful to have a political buffer against economic challenges -

whereas normally any decline in economic growth automatically dampens inflationary pressures, Serbia is unique in this respect again and, capable of doing two bad things at the same time: having both lower economic growth and higher inflation.", "This has been proved several times over the past few decades.", "And this is why it is necessary that the NBS continues pursuing a highly restrictive monetary policy.", "Fiscal policy: Everyone is perfectly clear as to what needs to be done.", "All projections currently under preparation as part of the 2009 budget must be as pessimistic as possible, on both the revenue and expenditure sides.", "Let me make a note of some of the key categories: Privatization revenue from the prior period has been spent and the likelihood of substantial future inflow of revenue on this account is Terms of borrowing in both domestic and international financial markets have already worsened - the price is not even asked; VAT revenue will certainly dwindle, as uncertainties rise and the purchasing power diminishes, The volume of contributions will also shrink!", "On the expenditure side, calls for looser fiscal policy will grow even stronger, especially as the private sector is retreating.", "The time of easy and cheap bank lending is now over.", "What is more, limited access to new lending may lead to limited investment in the private sector which Serbia stands in great need of.", "The two enduring macroeconomic challenges for Serbia -
