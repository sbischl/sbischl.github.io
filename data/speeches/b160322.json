or \"Wicksellian\" - interest rate.", "This rate can be defined as the interest rate consistent with the full employment of the factors of production.", "In this case, in order to achieve the right balance between savings and investment, markets rates must come down too.", "In normal times, central banks cut their key rates, and this passes through to the yield curve.", "However, in order to deal with the financial crisis, the ECB like other central banks have brought their key interest rates to very low levels, around zero.", "This means that our traditional monetary policy tools had to be supplemented by other instruments, known as non-standard instruments, in order to reach our prices stability objective.", "I will return to this point later.", "b) What is more with regard to the challenges we currently face, these deflationary pressures create the risk of an unanchoring of expectations, which would make it harder for us to achieve our 2% target again.", "Indeed, if inflation stayed too low for too long, economic agents may revise downwards their inflation expectations, which would create second round effects.", "Lower inflation expectations influence economic agents' price- and wage-setting behaviour, which in turn keeps inflation low.", "It can even raise the risk of deflation, defined as a cumulative process of falling prices, including those of assets, or even wages and production, as the world economy experienced in the 1930s or Japan partially underwent in the 1990s.", "Such deflationary dynamics are not at play today.", "But this risk is the reason why our inflation target is symmetrical.", "We consider too low inflation to be just as costly as too high inflation.", "And, therefore, it is more risky for central banks to act too late than too early.", "Since the start of the year, we have observed that market-based measures of inflation expectations have fallen.", "Nevertheless, the latest forecasts provided by the ECB continue to point to a gradual rise in inflation over the coming years: 0.1% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. c) Some argue that these challenges mean that the Eurosystem can no longer achieve its price stability mandate.", "Current challenges do not call into question our mandate, but they change the way in which we fulfil it.", "Some argue that the Eurosystem should rather change its objective.", "I don't think so either.", "For the credibility of monetary policy, this objective must be maintained: this 2% target is a medium-term \"anchor\", at a time when there is so much volatility and short-termism affecting the economy.", "Most central banks in advanced economies share this medium-term 2% objective, including the United States and Japan.", "This has been the ECB's objective since 2003, when it was proposed by the German former chief economist, Otmar Issing.", "This brings me to my second point: how effective is our monetary policy?", "a) Since the summer of 2014, we have implemented a series of non-standard monetary policy measures to complement cuts to key interest rates.", "These non-standard measures have produced tangible results.", "They have translated into a substantial easing in borrowing conditions for euro area companies.", "Since June 2014, the cost of borrowing for businesses has fallen by 80 basis points.", "Without non-standard measures, we estimate that we would have had to lower key rates by around 100 basis points in June 2014 to achieve a similar effect on bank interest rates.", "This has also helped to stimulate lending to the real economy: in the euro area, outstanding loans to businesses have gone from a contraction of -2.5% in June 2014 to growth of 0.6% in January 2016.", "The impact is even more marked in France, where outstanding business lending grew by 4.8% year-on-year in the first month of 2016 - the highest pace of growth in the euro area and, what's more, with the lowest rates of interest.", "Convergent estimates from the ECB and the Eurosystem indicate that, all other things being equal, the measures introduced since June 2014 should add 1 percentage point to inflation over the period 2015-2017, with a similar impact on growth.", "In France, they helped to boost 2015 growth by 0.3 percentage point, and estimates from INSEE even put the impact slightly higher at +0.4 pp.", "That represents about 80,000 additional jobs for the economy - although only structural reforms can generate lasting gains for a country's growth and employment.", "To conclude on this estimate of effectiveness, the IMF - regarded as an objective judge of the relevance of economic policies -

via forward guidance.", "So, negative interest rates are only part of a much more comprehensive package.", "We think that they have been effective, but they naturally have their limits.", "Furthermore, the Governing Council gave a strong signal of its will towards an internationally cooperative attitude, as it decided not to opt for a tiering system exempting banks from negative rates.", "Second message: our priority is to promote the financing of the real economy.", "The goal of TLTRO 2 is not, as some have claimed, to offset the impact of negative rates on banks.", "It is to encourage banks to lend to corporations, SMEs and households alike; similarly, extending the asset purchase programme to corporate bonds will be of particular benefit to large French corporations.", "In other words, we are securing the provision of credit to businesses and households, and protecting it from tensions linked to market volatility.", "c) Now, what about the risks?", "I talked earlier about the risks of doing nothing: we need to take action in order to bring inflation back up towards 2%.", "That said, we also need to keep a close eye out for any possible negative side-effects of our monetary policy, notably for financial stability.", "We are actively monitoring the financial cycle, including in France where the task falls to the High Council for Financial Stability set up in 2013.", "I took part in its 8th meeting at the Finance Ministry last week.", "For the time being, there are no signs of bubbles forming in our main financing markets: on the whole, developments in the equity markets appear in line with corporate profit forecasts, while evolutions in bond yields also seem consistent with the outlook for inflation and growth.", "Nor are there any signs of excessive credit growth in the financial system.", "Nevertheless, we remain vigilant over all aspects of the current macroeconomic and financial environment.", "Last week the High Council for Financial Stability alerted on potential risks associated with commercial real estate, especially: \"the sharp rise in demand by investors on certain market segments and a high level of prices, in particular office prices in the Paris area\".", "The HCSF's assessment will be released for public consultation in the coming weeks.", "We are ready, when needed, to take action with macroprudential measures, to prevent and mitigate any systemic risks that might arise.", "In sum, monetary policy is doing a great deal to counter weak inflation and support economic activity -
