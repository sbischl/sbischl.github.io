meeting in March, the Executive Board noted that the monetary stance in Norway is accommodative.", "Underlying inflation is a little higher than the inflation target.", "Capacity utilisation appears to be slightly above a normal level.", "The upturn in the Norwegian economy is expected to continue, partly fuelled by strong pick-up in investment on the Norwegian shelf in 2019.", "Further out, lower growth abroad and a decline in petroleum investment will weigh on growth.", "Chart: The Executive Board's assessment and interest rate forecast The Board decided at the meeting to raise the policy rate to 1 percent.", "The assessment of the outlook and the balance of risks suggested that the policy rate will most likely be increased further in the course of the next half-year.", "To wrap up, globalisation, digitalisation and structural changes are facets of the same long-term trend - we are in the midst of a technology-driven growth process that encompasses much of the world.", "It is easy to focus on the negatives, but we must also keep our eyes fixed on the big picture: never before have so many taken part in a journey with such a great leap in prosperity.", "But growth is unevenly distributed.", "The winners in global competition are reaping substantial rewards, while broad categories of wage earners in the traditional industrial economies have been left behind.", "The harmful effects of rising inequality must be taken seriously.", "We, the grownups, should also listen to the message sent from our youngsters.", "They demand that the world's leaders take the climate
