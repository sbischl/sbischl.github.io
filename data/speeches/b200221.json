minutes of the meeting (p. 3), \"Participants further observed that such inflation risks-along with several of the other perceived risks of providing substantial accommodation through nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse implications for financial stability-had not been realized.", "In particular, a number of participants commented that, as many of the potential costs of the Committee's asset purchases had failed to materialize, the Federal Reserve might have been able to make use of balance sheet tools even more aggressively over the past decade in providing appropriate levels of accommodation.\"", "(Available on the Board's website at ).", "In some cases, expectations regarding the timing of liftoff and asset purchase tapering worked at cross-purposes.", "In addition, in some cases, it proved difficult to calibrate asset purchase programs smoothly over the course of the recovery.", "To the extent that the public is uncertain about the conditions that might trigger asset purchases, the scale of purchases, and how long the purchases might be sustained, it could undercut the efficacy of the policy.", "Furthermore, the cessation of asset purchases and subsequent balance sheet normalization can present challenges in communications and implementation.", "Finally, in the fog of war, it was difficult for policymakers to distinguish clearly between temporary headwinds associated with the crisis and emerging structural features of the new normal.", "In part as a result, it took some time to integrate forward guidance and other unconventional policies seamlessly, and it took even longer to recognize that policy settings were unlikely to return to pre-crisis norms.", "The current generation of central bankers faces a different core challenge than the last generation, with substantially smaller scope for cutting interest rates to buffer the economy and inflation that is low and relatively unresponsive to resource utilization.", "With trend inflation running below the symmetric 2 percent objective, there is a risk that inflation expectations have slipped.", "With price inflation showing little sensitivity to resource utilization, policy may have to remain accommodative for a long time to achieve 2 percent inflation following a period of undershooting.", "With the equilibrium interest rate very low, the Federal Open Market Committee can cut the federal funds rate by only about half as much as it has done historically to buffer the economy from recession.", "Consequently, the policy rate is likely to be constrained by the lower bound more frequently, likely at times when inflation is below target and unemployment is elevated.", "The likelihood that the policy rate will be stuck at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected inflation and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral.", "Japan's experience illustrates the challenges associated with such a downward spiral.", "Today's new normal calls not only for a broader set of tools, but also a different strategy.", "We should clarify in advance that we will deploy a broader set of tools proactively to provide accommodation when shocks are likely to push the policy rate to its lower bound.", "Equally important, we should adopt a strategy that successfully achieves maximum employment and average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time.", "The lessons from the crisis would argue for an approach that commits to maintain policy at the lower bound until full employment and target inflation are achieved.", "This forward guidance could be reinforced by interest rate caps on short-term Treasury securities over the same horizon.", "To have the greatest effect, it will be important to communicate and explain the framework in advance so that the public anticipates the approach and takes it into account in their spending and investment decisions.", "Forward guidance that commits to refrain from lifting the policy rate from its lower bound until full employment and 2 percent inflation are achieved is vital to ensure achievement of our dual-mandate goals with compressed conventional policy space.", "To strengthen the credibility of the forward guidance, interest rate caps could be implemented in tandem as a commitment mechanism.", "Based on its assessment of how long it is likely to take to achieve full employment and target inflation, the Committee would commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with its expectation for the duration of the outcome-based forward guidance.", "Of course, if the outlook shifted materially, the Committee could reassess how long it will take to reach its goals and adjust policy accordingly.", "One important benefit is that this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve once the policy rate moves to the lower bound and avoid the risk of delays or uncertainty that could be associated with asset purchases regarding the scale and timeframe.", "The interest rate caps would transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are relevant for households and businesses in a manner that is more akin to conventional policy and more continuous than quantitative asset purchases.", "Another important benefit is that the forward guidance and the yield curve caps would reinforce each other.", "Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.", "Once target inflation and full employment are achieved, and the caps expire, any short-to- medium-term Treasury securities that were acquired under the program would roll off organically, unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably.", "This approach should avoid some of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature steepening of the yield curve in several jurisdictions.", "Today's low-inflation, low interest rate environment requires not only new recession-fighting tools but also a new strategy to address the persistent undershooting of the inflation target-and the risk to inflation expectations-well before a downturn.", "Various strategies have been proposed that seek to make up for past inflation deviations from target.", "To be successful, formal makeup strategies, such as an average-inflation- targeting rule, require that market participants, households, and businesses understand the policy in advance and find it credible.", "While formal average-inflation-targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be difficult to communicate and implement in practice due to time-inconsistency problems as well as uncertainty about underlying economic parameters.", "I prefer flexible inflation averaging that would aim to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time.", "Flexible inflation averaging would imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for the inflation shortfall over previous years and anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.", "Flexible inflation For unusually severe recessions, such as the financial crisis, such an approach could be augmented with purchases of 10-year Treasury securities to provide further accommodation at the long end of the yield curve.", "The requisite scale of such purchases-when combined with medium-term yield curve ceilings and forward guidance on the policy rate-should be relatively smaller than if the longer-term asset purchases were used alone.", "See, for example, Lars E.O.", "Svensson (2020), \"Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve,\" NBER Working Paper Series 26657 (Cambridge, Mass.", ": National Bureau of Economic Research, January).", "See the discussion of formal makeup

several years when inflation has remained in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, the Committee could target inflation outcomes in a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for a period to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent, on average, overall.", "By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the Committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.", "This approach will help move inflation expectations back to our 2 percent objective, which is critical to preserve conventional policy space.", "It is important to emphasize that for monetary policy to be effective, it will be key for policymakers to communicate their strategy clearly in advance to the public, to act early and decisively, and to commit to providing the requisite accommodation until full employment and target inflation are sustainably achieved.", "This was one of the important conclusions of this year's U.S. Monetary Policy Forum report.", "Even with a revamped monetary policy strategy and expanded tools, there are risks.", "As the authors note, persistent very low levels of long-run rates could hamper the ability of monetary policy to support the economy in a downturn through the traditional mechanism of pushing down long-term rates.", "Moreover, the equilibrium interest rate or, possibly, inflation expectations could be lower than most current estimates, with the implication that unconventional policies would need to compensate for a larger reduction in the conventional policy buffer.", "Accordingly, in addition to a forceful response from monetary policy, robust countercyclical fiscal policy is vital.", "The reduced conventional monetary policy buffer makes the importance of fiscal support during a downturn even greater than it has been in the past, and the case for fiscal support is especially compelling in the context of very low long-term interest rates.", "Not only is fiscal policy more vital when monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound, but research suggests it is also more powerful.", "Whereas monetary policy is powerful but blunt, fiscal policy can be more targeted in its effects.", "This is especially important today, when a large share of American households have low liquid savings and are particularly vulnerable to periods of unemployment or underemployment.", "The appropriate design of a more automatic, faster-acting countercyclical fiscal approach requires study and development.", "Just as monetary policymakers are actively reviewing their tools and strategies, now is the time to undertake a review of fiscal tools and strategies to ensure they are ready and effective.", "longer-term interest rates have declined to very low levels and would likely be even lower following an adverse shock that could lead to the resumption of large-scale asset purchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for balance sheet tools to provide accommodation.\"", "(Available on the Board's website at ).", "See, for instance, Michael T.
