or remove - economically binding limits, that is, if they are more stringent than the constraints imposed on intermediaries by voluntary decisions or by market pressures.", "For example, if during recessions risk aversion or market pressures raise banks' desired capital ratios above regulatory thresholds (a situation that applies to many economies in the current environment), a policy of releasing capital constraints (e.g.", "via the countercyclical buffer) would have no effect:14 the authority would find itself pushing on a string.", "This reasoning suggests two considerations.", "First, MAP tools should in principle be more effective during upswings of the financial cycle: when optimism prevails, market constraints are weaker and banks typically hold less excess capital or liquid buffers.", "However, as already mentioned, during such times incentives towards elusion are likely to be stronger.", "These two offsetting effects make it hard to gauge whether MAP instruments are more effective during upturns than downturns.", "Second, for an effective release of some MAP tools in bad times, there must have been an adequate tightening in good times.", "This is vividly illustrated by the behavior of capital ratios during the current crisis.", "Large banks, typically endowed with thin capital buffers, reacted to the downturn by increasing capital procyclically.", "By contrast, small banks, which entered the crisis with large capital buffers, effectively acted as stabilizers.", "There is clear evidence of this behaviour for both the US and the European banking systems (see Figure 1).", "The IMF has recently analysed the degree of symmetry of MAP policies, without reaching firm conclusions.", "In the 36 countries examined, between 2000 and 2011 the cases of policy tightening far outnumbered the episodes of loosening.", "Most of the loosening measures, often consisting in the relaxation of previously tightened instruments, occurred after 2008.", "The econometric exercise is inconclusive on whether MAP measures have symmetric or asymmetric effects, but the results have to be interpreted with caution, as the incidence of loosening events may be too small to detect statistically significant differences.", ".3 Adjustment of policy tools: speed, size The speed at which policy tools can be adjusted also deserves attention.", "In the Netherlands, a recent decision by the government (contained in the 2012 Stability Programme) forsees a gradual lowering of the maximum LTV ratio from 106 per cent in 2012 to 100 per cent.", "The decline is expected to take place at a pace of about 1 percentage point per year.", "As a comparison, in Italy the average LTV declined by almost 10 percentage points from 2006 to 2012 - about 1.6 percentage points per year.", "This is a much faster adjustment - note that it was not driven by the regulator, but by banks' autonomously adopted policies.", "What is the right adjustment speed?", "A look at housing market cycles provides insights in this respect.", "Both upturns and downturns in housing cycles in advanced countries last on average around 5 years.", "This suggests that the tightening pace adopted in the Netherlands might be too slow, with risks that the countercyclical policy could be fully effective only at the turning point of the cycle.", "This is not a criticism;18 I just mean to illustrate a general point.", "My assessment is that our knowledge in this area is particularly poor, and that we must make the most of the empirical evidence that will accumulate from future policy experiments.", "The speed of adjustment is clearly related to the size of the adjustment.", "For example, the countercyclical capital buffer will have to be managed taking into account that an increase, say, will affect all banks at the same time.", "Therefore, a sudden, sharp increase could S.G.

very powerful.", "Operational challenges in Europe Let me now turn to two practical aspects in the implementation of macroprudential tools on which significant progress is required, with a focus on Europe.", ".1 Gaps in the statistical framework One not very glamorous but key issue is the question whether statistical reporting is adequate to help ensure policy implementation and instrument effectiveness.", "Housing market cycles differ substantially across countries (Figure 2), suggesting that MAP policies aimed at curbing problems of overheating in the realestate sector should be tailored to the national situation.", "The regulation being finalized in the EU (CRD-IV/CRR) properly allows for national leeway.", "In line with this evidence, a recent survey among euro-area NCBs, conducted by the Bank of Italy and presented in our latest Financial Stability Report, shows that there is substantial dispersion of average LTV ratios in the euro area.", "Ratios on new loans in 2011 ranged from below 60 per cent in some countries to more than 100 per cent in others (Figure 3; one must bear in mind that LTV is not yet a MAP instrument in most EU countries).", "There is also significant heterogeneity in the underlying statistics.", "For example, the survey just mentioned showed differences with regard to the LTV definitions and the methods of collecting and aggregating data across Europe.", "Should the value of the real estate be recorded at mortgage issuance?", "Or, should it be updated?", "Should there be a difference between first homes and other houses?", "Each different answer to any of these questions may give rise to methodological differences in computed LTVs.", "These discrepancies hamper cross-country comparisons; going forward, they can hinder MAP implementation and coordination among the euro-area countries.", "Work to harmonize statistics in this field is beginning in the light of the forthcoming establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).", "Consider next non-performing loans (NPLs).", "These are arguably key pieces of information for micro as well as for macroprudential policies.", "But lack of a harmonized definition, even at the European level, prevents robust cross-country comparisons.", "As an example, the definition used by Italian banks - which is set by the Bank of Italy - is generally broader and more rigorous than elsewhere in Europe.", "Our analyses show that, controlling for differences in the way collateralized positions are treated in the definition of NPLs, Italian banks would display on average substantially better NPL and coverage ratios (Figure 4).", "Also, the dynamics of the two ratios would change substantially: whereas the official coverage ratio decreased by 1.5 percentage points between 2009 and 2012, the \"adjusted\" ratio (computed according to the methodology used by a sample of large European banks) would increase by 3.3 points.", "What is more, this is just one of the factors affecting cross-country comparison of NPLs.", "Other differences emerge, e.g.", "with respect to the definition of restructured loans.", "A cross-country comparison that fails to take these methodological problems properly into account would be misleading.", "The issue is clearly thorny, because changing well-established national practices to converge to a uniform standard entails adjustment costs, which generate resistance.", "The asset quality review that planned under the developing SSM should address these problems.", "A last example concerns indicators of banks' funding/liquidity conditions.", "For lack of data, the funding gap is often approximated by the loans-to-deposits ratio (this was standard practice in the IMF GFSR until recently, and it still is in the FSR of the European Central Bank).", "However, correct measurement of the gap should consider all sources of retail funding, including bank bonds subscribed by retail customers (which proved to be as stable as retail deposits).", "Given large cross-country differences (for example, retail bonds are an important source of funding in Italy, but not in other countries), the use of rough measures, sometimes induced by lack of publicly available data, may misrepresent the true funding conditions of banks in some countries and alter international comparisons (Figure 5).", ".2 The institutional framework in Europe A full assessment of the institutional set-up for MAP policy in the European Union is premature, also in the light of the implementation uncertainties for the SSM.", "However, it is clear that the various reforms and regulations introduced have produced a very complex framework.", "An effort is necessary to minimize inefficiencies and foster an effective interaction among the different actors involved.", "Several key issues remain to be addressed.", "The first has to do with the respective roles and powers of the SSM and the National MAP Authorities (NAs).", "The legislation being finalized (CRD-IV/CRR and the SSM Regulation) gives asymmetric powers to the two parties, with the ECB able only to tighten macroprudential tools above the regulatory minima and the NAs empowered to implement bi- directional policies.", "At the same time, however, a symmetric feature is also envisaged by the rules: the ECB can object to policy decisions taken by the NAs, which will in turn have to \"duly consider\" any such objections; the NAs can do the same with regard to ECB's decisions, and the ECB has also to \"duly consider\" the NAs' objections.", "As for this symmetry of \"objection\" powers, it remains to be seen who will have the final say if the objections are not duly taken into account.", "Without a tie-breaking mechanism, the risk of a stalemate seems by no means negligible.", "A related issue is that of cooperation/coordination between the SSM and the NAs.", "This is explicitly addressed only for the tools included in the CRD-IV/CRR package.", "It is essential that work continue on the definition of a coordination framework also for instruments currently excluded from the European regulation, such as the LTV or the DTI ratios, as an equilibrium relying mainly on authorities' good will could turn out to be unstable.", "Such a framework would help address the risk that measures taken with a purely domestic perspective have negative spillovers on other countries.", "A final issue concerns the interaction between the ESRB and the SSM, which is also likely to be complex.", "Should the ESRB be strengthened and made more independent from the ECB- SSM?", "Or should it be kept as a lean institution, in charge of coordination among SSM countries and other EU countries, and among central banks and supervisory authorities not represented in the SSM?", "The debate is in its early stages.", "Much will depend on how many EU countries join the SSM.", "While each solution has its pros and cons, the risk of an overcrowded arena in the MAP field is material.", "To maximize the effectiveness of the MAP framework in Europe, a principle that should be heeded is that strong microprudential supervision is a necessary precondition for effective macroprudential policy.", "Indeed, MAP policy is to a large extent the use of microprudential tools with a macro perspective.", "It is therefore crucial to coordinate the use of prudential tools for both purposes.", "As an example, consider the actions that the Bank of Italy recently undertook with the aim of increasing bank provisioning, in order to improve investor confidence in Italian banks.", "With a macroprudential perspective, in order to avoid procyclicality the Bank of Italy at the same time asked banks to increase internallygenerated resources by containing costs, disposing of non-strategic assets and aligning dividend policies to their balance-sheet and income strength.", "These actions should limit the risk that, in a context of weak economic activity and tight credit conditions, the increase in provisioning might lead to a deterioration in the availability of credit to the private sector.", "Conclusions Macroprudential policy may play a crucial role in preserving financial stability.", "But in this new field of policymaking, more than in others, we should keep in mind that no solution is obviously right or wrong.", "More experience is needed on the functioning of macroprudential authorities and the use of tools.", "As progress will inevitably follow from a learn-by-doing type of approach, policymakers should not shy away from carefully planned but bold experiments.", "Some countries are already moving in this direction.", "The signs of overheating that are emerging in some segments of the financial system may soon require appropriate macroprudential measures.", "Policymakers should not repeat the errors made in the run-up to the crisis, when many supervisors turned a blind eye to the imbalances that were building up in their economies.", "Some conceptual steps need to be taken.", "First, elusion and waterbed effects may hamper the effectiveness of MAP policies, especially when measures are narrow.", "A system of tight micro supervision can go a long way towards addressing circumvention.", "The simultaneous use of complementary macroprudential tools, rather than a single targeted tool, can also help.", "Effective cross-border cooperation is key to fight spillovers.", "Unfortunately, at present centrifugal forces seem to prevail, in Europe as elsewhere.", "Second, we need to explore carefully the degree of asymmetry of MAP tools over the financial cycle.", "In principle, MAP tools should be more effective during upswings, whereas during downturns market pressures may impose excessive constraints on intermediaries, making the policies of releasing the previously accumulated buffers less effective.", "In practice, however, during upswings incentives towards elusion are likely to be stronger.", "These two offsetting effects make it hard to establish whether MAP instruments are more effective during upturns than downturns.", "Also, for an effective release of some macroprudential tools in bad times, there must have been a substantial tightening in good times.", "The speed at which policy tools can be adjusted also deserves attention.", "Third, a prerequisite to make progress in all of the above areas is to have a reliable statistical framework.", "The amount of work needed to harmonize key indicators for MAP policy is immense, even within the EU.", "Finally, progress is needed in the definition of the institutional and legal framework for MAP policy.", "At the global level, the design of financial regulation involves, in different degrees, several authorities and supranational bodies (the G20, the FSB, the IMF, the BIS, to name just the main ones).", "The macroprudential arena is also very crowded.", "In Europe, tasks are today (or will be shortly) shared among the ESRB, the ECB, the European Commission, and the NAs.", "There is a material risk that such a proliferation of fora and decision-making bodies could end up complicating coordination and synergies.", "In this context, I believe that serious thought should be given to institutional simplification and a clear allocation of tasks.", "Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios for commercial banks,
