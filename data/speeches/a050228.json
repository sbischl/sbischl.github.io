factors, we should welcome them.", "It is satisfying that these days there are fewer complaints about the euro exchange rate than before.", "At the macro level, this is appropriate.", "Rather than with the rock-bottom level seen several years ago, the current level of the euro/dollar rate should be compared with the average level over a prolonged period.", "To assess our competitive position,
