Srinivas, General Manager and Shri.", "Saswat Mahapatra, Asst.", "General Manager in the preparation of this address.", "Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen I am glad to be in your midst today to share my thoughts on \"Banking, electronic payments and the road ahead\".", "In fact the subject of my address very well fits the theme of the conference \"Global banking: Paradigm shift\" and its emphasis on productivity excellence.", "I am sure the experts whom you would have heard and interacted with over the last two days would have shared their thoughts on the changes and challenges that banking in India and globally is undergoing and has undergone over these last few momentous years, leading as it were to a paradigm shift in the way banks are doing their business and retaining and increasing their customer base.", "The basic underlying current that runs through this changing landscape is the ever increasing reliance on technology to cater to the needs of customers and process vast number of transactions including payment transactions.", "In fact as you all are aware, payment and settlement systems form the backbone of any economy.", "They are the conduits or the arteries for conducting trade, commerce and other forms of economic activities including remittances in any country.", "An efficient payments system can be envisaged as the lubricant which speeds up the liquidity flow in the economy, thereby creating the necessary impetus and momentum for economic growth.", "The payments process is a vital aspect of financial intermediation; it enables the creation and transfer of liquidity among different economic agents.", "A smooth, well functioning and regulated payments system thus not only ensures efficient utilisation of scarce resources but also eliminates systemic risks.", "The payments and settlement system is, therefore, a crucial component of the financial infrastructure of any country and more so of a country like ours.", "The spectacular growth in financial transactions in the country has necessitated certain radical changes in the payments and settlement system, whether it be in the area of wholesale payments or retail payments.", "While the changes in the wholesale payments are devoted to providing an efficient channel for transmission of monetary policy signals, and for the smooth functioning of various markets, the changes in the retail payments are aimed at providing efficient and timely payment mechanisms to the citizens of this country.", "The payment system also assumes importance in the context of domestic financial sector reforms and global financial integration that the country is undergoing currently.", "Foreign investments (direct and portfolio) are encouraged by the availability of an efficient payments system, as also the need for a low cost remittance facility for migrants to send money to their kith and kin within the country.", "Improved, faster and cheaper domestic money transfers through the payments system is also a part of the emerging scenario.", "Given this scenario, let me through the remainder of this address devote myself to providing a bird's eye-view of the current payment system landscape in the country; the other significant initiatives that have been undertaken; the game changers that would provide further fillip to this endeavour; identifying the potential goldmine as it were for deepening this process; the enablers to take this process forward; the challenges faced at the industry level; the role of the regulatory framework which could serve as a catalyst; and conclude with what I would call the 5 A's of payment systems for providing an efficient, robust, safe, costeffective payment services to our fellow citizens.", "Section 1: payment system landscape in India The stage of payment system development in a country to a large extent depends upon the adoption of technology, introduction of new payment instruments and the confidence of the public in using these payment instruments.", "In India cash still continues to be the predominant payment mode.", "This can be gauged from the fact that value of bank notes and coins in circulation as a percentage of narrow money is very high at 60.07% for the year 2009-20101, when compared to other emerging economies like South Africa (18.51%), China(18.83%), Mexico (39.14%).", "Brazil comes close to India with 52.70% of the value of banknotes and coins in circulation as a percentage of narrow money.", "This is perhaps a pointer that we have been relatively slow in embracing cashless payment modes and using them as cash substitute.", "The pre-dominant use of cash could also be attributed to the fact that the process for adoption of non-cash mode of payments started relatively late in the country.", "Notwithstanding this, the Reserve Bank has been in the forefront both as operator and facilitator for promoting the use of cashless payment instruments in the country.", "The technology implementation in banks which have shaped the payment system in turn is largely driven by the recommendations of the various committees set up by RBI.", "Payment system modernisation started in late eighties with introduction of MICR based cheque clearing in mid eighties.", "Paper based clearing: Paper based Clearing accounts for 59% of the total volume of transactions while it represents only 10% of the total value of transactions.", "RBI has taken a number of initiatives to promote efficiency in paper based clearing such as widespread use of MICR technology at 66 major centres in the country.", "Simultaneously, the introduction of speed clearing in 2008 has facilitated collection of outstation cheques on a local basis leveraging on core-banking infrastructure of banks.", "Speed clearing is currently available in 240 centres across the country.", "Cheque Truncation System was operationalised in the National Capital Region, New Delhi in February 2008.", "Chennai has been

of CTS for Grid-based CTS at Chennai have been completed and the system is ready for roll-out by NPCI.", "A new automation software package called \"Express Cheque Clearing System\" (ECCS) has been developed.", "ECCS, being implemented jointly by SBI and NPCI, would replace the Magnetic Media Based Clearing Software employed in automation of Clearing Houses available at 1093 locations.", "It is expected to be rolled out across all these centres by September 2011 along with the speed clearing facility.", "Electronic Payment Systems: Electronic Payment Systems accounts for 41% of the total volume of transactions while it represents 90% of the total value of transactions.", "Introduction of electronic payment products such as Electronic clearing service and electronic funds transfer, which over the years have metamorphosed into National ECS and National EFT and RTGS have ushered in new ways of payment processing.", "National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT): NEFT was introduced in November 2005 now covers 77,821 branches and offers eleven hourly near real-time settlements on week days and five settlements on Saturdays.", "One of the unique features of the system is a mandatory

volumes are 8.05 million transactions (ECS Credit - NECS, Regional and local) and 13.40 million transactions (ECS Debit - Regional and local), while monthly values are averaging about Rs..43 billion and Rs..60 billion for ECS Credit and ECS Debit respectively.", "Real time Gross Settlement (RTGS): The RTGS system was introduced in March 2004 and now extends to 77,093 branches as at the end of June 2011.", "RTGS settles gross inter-bank and customer (Rs.", "lakh and above) transactions.", "On an average RTGS settles 1.8 lakh transactions with a value of Rs.", "4 trillion on a daily basis.", "Considering the importance of RTGS for settling large value payment systems, action has been initiated for putting in place a Next-Gen RTGS.", "Other retail payment channels: Credit/Debit Cards: One of the fastest growing segments is the card segment with 18 million outstanding credit cards and 228 million debit cards.", "During the year 2010-11 (April-March) 265 million transactions for a value

happens at ATMs with 4235 million transactions for a value of Rs.,144 billion.", "Pre-paid instruments: The pre-paid instrument issuers' universe is populated by both banks and non-banks.", "In fact after the enactment of PSS Act, most of the non-bank entities who have received authorisation to operate a payment system are in this business segment.", "Policy Guidelines for issuance and operation of pre-paid payment instruments in India have been issued to provide for a framework for the orderly growth of this nascent market.", "Further measures have been recently announced by the Reserve Bank of India permitting banks to issue prepaid payment instruments to corporates for onward issuance to their employees after adhering to the norms prescribed.", "Mobile Banking: The operating guidelines

have also been permitted to provide money transfer facility up to Rs.,000 from a bank account to beneficiaries not having bank accounts with cash payout facility at an ATM or Banking Correspondent.", "50 banks have been permitted to offer Mobile Banking transactions, of which 38 have started operations.", "The NEFT platform is used for settlement of all interbank mobile banking transactions.", "Inter-bank mobile payment system: The IMPS on the other hand is a service operated by NPCI which provides an instant, 24X7, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones.", "Publicly launched on November 22, 2010 this system facilitates customers registered with their banks for this service to use mobile instruments as a channel for interbank fund transfers in a secured manner with immediate confirmation features.", "This service is in consonance with the Mobile Payment Guidelines 2008 issued by RBI which stress on interoperability both across banks and mobile operators in a safe and secured manner.", "Currently 27 member banks participate in this scheme.", "National Financial Switch (NFS): The National Financial Switch as its name indicates is a national infrastructure with pan-Indian presence provides a switching service for connectivity across ATMs of banks.", "The NFS enables customers to perform their transactions (both financial and non-financial) using ATMs under the NFS network without reference to the card issuing banks.", "NFS which is the largest ATM switching network connects 80000+ ATMs with an average daily volume of

once implemented will bring significant benefits to all the key stakeholders like government, banks, primary dealers, FIs and the common citizens.", "CBS in RBI will enable anywhere banking (specially payments) to government departments, treasuries, sub-treasuries through online access and use of epayment modes / delivery channels.", "In other words, it would facilitate government to use RTGS, NEFT, NECS and other electronic delivery channels for making all its payments through a single bank resulting in reconciliation being that much easier.", "Banks and financial institutions will benefit from system of having a centralised account for funds and securities and an on-line transaction tracking mechanism linking funds and security legs.", "CBS is also intended to provide limited functionality of RTGS in case the RTGS services are not available for any reason.", "Section 3: game changers Having given a brief on the payment system landscape in India let me draw your attention to some of the trends which have within them the potential to drive our existing payment systems into the next orbit.", "Entry of non-banks in payment systems: Payment systems in India till recently have been the domain of banks.", "With the legislation of Payment and Settlement System Act, 2007 (PSS Act) the arena has been opened up for entry of non-bank entities.", "Currently 31 non-bank entities have been permitted to operate payment systems such as issuance of pre-paid payment instruments, providing cross-border in-bound money transfer, cards payment network and ATM networks.", "The entry of non-bank entities has the potential to change the payment system landscape as these entities can leverage on their product offerings with latest technological features to cater to wide segment of the market.", "Of course the Reserve Bank has laid down appropriate guidelines and safeguards to protect the customers' financial and other interest and promote orderly growth in the markets.", "Entry of non-bank entities will promote competition and thereby provide more choice to the customers.", "Unique Identification authority of India - Aadhaar project - The unique identity number (Aadhaar) is poised to be an important driver of financial inclusion initiatives.", "Aadhaar which will provide a unique identification valid through the country when integrated with payment system application has the potential to shape the payment system future in the country.", "Rapid improvements in the payment infrastructure: Last few years have seen expansion in the payment system infrastructure as a whole.", "There has been entry of new payment system operators, growing acceptance of new delivery channels, new products, increase in number of ATMs (80000+), PoS terminals

providers and merchant acquirers gaining ground in the industry.", "Setting up of National Payment Corporation of India Ltd: NPCI has been set up as an umbrella organisation for retail payments with an objective of integrating and consolidating various clearing houses in the country for cheques and electronic payments and introduce new payment applications with focus on electronic payments.", "NPCI has already introduced RuPay, an indigenous domestic card scheme.", "It has also started operating Interbank Mobile Payment System (IMPS) which offers an instant 24X7, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones.", "Domestic Card scheme - RuPay: The need for a domestic payment card the \"RuPay\" card is on account of two factors: (a) the high cost borne by the Indian banks for affiliation with international card associations in the absence of a domestic price setter and (b) the connection with international card associations resulting in the need for routing even domestic transactions, which account for more than 90% of the total, through a switch located outside the country.", "NPCI has since been granted approval to launch the \"RuPay\" affiliated cards for use at ATMs and Micro ATMs.", "NPCI has been advised to ensure that the use of these cards under the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) is in strict compliance with the DBOD guidelines on Business Correspondents (BCs).", "4 banks have started using the RuPay card.", "These include: Kashi Gomati Gramin Bank; Bank of India DhanAdhar Card; The Gopinath Patil Parsik Janata Sahkari Bank Ltd; NKGSB

Untapped market: It would become very evident from the following figures that financial inclusion should be seen not only as a social responsibility but also as a potential business model because of the huge untapped market that it seeks to bring into the fold of banking services.", "In India almost halh the country is unbanked.", "Of the 6 lakh villages in India, the total number of villages with banking services stands at less than 1 lakh villages as at end March 2011.", "India has a highest number of households (approximately 145 million) who are excluded from banking.", "Thus this \"bottom of the pyramid\" which comprises a huge section of the Indian population presents a large untapped market with a tremendous business potential.", "Therefore, the banks in India need to devise appropriate strategies for tapping the banking value that is represented by these large number of households at the bottom of the pyramid.", "Government transactions - Transfer of benefit schemes: The largest chunk of government transactions with the citizens comprise revenue collection and transfer of benefits under various social programmes.", "McKinsey Report 2010 \"Inclusive growth and financial security: The benefits of e-payments to Indian society\" estimates that an electronic platform for government payments to and from individual households could save an estimated Rs.,000 crore a year - representing almost 10 percent of the total payment flows between the government and households.", "The report states that \"delivering government payments electronically to the poor will not only pay for itself but will connect households to a formal and secure financial grid.", "The basic infrastructure and connectivity this provides will also create an attractive business proposition to encourage private players to enter this space and provide services to the poor\".", "The Reserve Bank has recently issued \"Operational Guidelines on implementation of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) and its convergence with Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP)\".", "These guidelines are expected to give a fillip to financial inclusion efforts and lead to a scalable and sustainable financial inclusion model.", "In fact as you may be aware the Union Finance Ministry has advised all state owned banks and financial institutions to make payments only through electronic transfers and not through cheques from 1st September 2011.", "This move is part of the e-governance initiative to move towards a paperless funds transfer system.", "For the banks as well this would be economical proposition as it would reduce paper handling costs.", "Potential triggers -

"\"7 In this context the efforts of the government, the Reserve Bank and the banking industry to provide banking services through financial inclusion have to be seen, appreciated and pushed forward with greater vigour.", "The challenge will be for the banks to integrate and reinvent their payment system infrastructure to cater to the customers at the extreme ends of the value chain especially at the bottom of the pyramid.", "I have already recounted some of the initiatives such as mobile banking, Aadhaar enabled payment systems, liberalisation of BC guidelines etc, which when deployed with a sound business plan can generate value not only to the customers but also to the banks.", "A simple example which readily comes to mind are the small ticket mobile prepaid coupons which are needed by customers at the bottom of the pyramid and are at the same time significant contributors to the revenues of mobile operators.", "So also is the case with single serve sachets of shampoo and toothpaste which are convenient and easy to use.", "Developing an interoperable payment ecosystem: I will touch upon another dimension to distribution of payment services.", "Can we visualize a state of interoperability where a customer walks into any bank branch or post office for meeting his normal banking needs without necessarily visiting the bank/branch where he has an account?", "Whether the issue of availability could be addressed through inter-operability in the payment systems by building an ecosystem consisting of banks, post offices, BCs and may be non-bank participants in the system.", "It is perhaps appropriate that we benchmark Benchmarking against global standards: ourselves against global standards as the world has become an integrated one with India becoming part of the global village.", "Cyber frauds are no longer restricted to onshore entities but could very well be triggered by offshore entities.", "In such a scenario it is extremely crucial that we benchmark our products, processes and designs with the globally available best practices and standards.", "Technology adoption and educating customers for appropriate use of technology is also part of this enabling process to usher in best practices and standards in the industry and the customer base that it serves.", "In this connection I may mention that RBI is member of the committee of payment and settlement systems, BIS, Basel which is the international standard setting body for payment and settlement systems.", "As part of this endeavour RBI is a member of steering group set up for framing the principles for financial market infrastructure (FMI).", "The principles for FMI' report has just concluded its public consultation and it is likely that the final report will be issued early next year.", "The principles for FMI report has 24 recommendations devoted to the public policy objectives of safety, security of FMIs.", "Section 7: regulatory framework to serve as a catalyst For the industry to prosper and for innovation to thrive a sound complementary regulatory framework is very much required.", "Such a framework should provide a level playing field for all providers to enable the customer to exercise his choices as regards choosing a particular service provider.", "Other important components for such a regulatory framework would also encompass customer protection issues, fraud prevention issues, security related issues and fair pricing.", "Having said this I draw your attention to the RBI's vision document for payment systems for the period 2009-2012 wherein the framework for operation of all payment and settlement systems in the country has been clearly stated as being more than the usual 3Ss+E viz.", "safety, security, soundness and efficiency coupled with the 2As accessibility and authorisation.", "Concomitant with this vision some of the regulatory measures taken by RBI include the creation and classification of the ATM network as a shared national payment infrastructure; mandating safety and security of transactions both paper based and electronic and card based payment systems; prescribing standards for cheques under cheque truncation; creating customer comfort through provision of positive confirmation, creation of customer facilitation centres, reducing the time taken for resolution of ATM failed transactions; telecommunication connectivity scheme for northeast region for expanding the reach of banking services; etc.", "The regulatory framework also promoted innovation and orderly developments of new payment products such as prepaid card and mobile banking etc.", "RBI has also undertaken selective intervention in pricing framework for various payment products to enhance their reach amongst the public.", "Section 8: 5 A's of payment system Before I conclude, let me attempt to provide a link with my topic with the next session, which is on cost efficient business model for low cost banking.", "In conclusion I would draw your attention to what I have generically termed as the 5 A's of a payment system.", "These are availability, accessibility, acceptability, affordability and awareness of the system and the product.", "Availability combines the notion of a level playing field for the service providers along with the availability of choice of products for the consumers.", "as a concept should be the cornerstone to expand the reach of the banking systems and the various payment products to all the sections of the society including the \"aam aadmi\" as part of the financial inclusion plan and efforts.", "Acceptability is the thought process which enables the customers to embrace the newer products and technology such that these become ubiquitous in nature just as mobile telephony has become in the country.", "Affordability is a key corner stone which should guide the product offering as being value for money for the customers with technology and innovation being the important drivers for providing cost effective and quality services by the service providers.", "Awareness - Creating awareness through financial literacy campaigns is necessary to increase the volumes in the payments business and to generate the necessary network effects for the successful operationalisation and implementation of newer technologically cost effective sound payment products.", "It is also necessary to simultaneously create awareness for inculcating security consciousness among the users of the various payment products to prevent instances of fraud and misuse.", "I would urge the IBA to take a lead in this regard and conduct payment system awareness campaign in tier II and tier III cities especially to spread this message.", "To supplement and to generate interest interactive software in the form of simulations and games could be part of this exercise.", "Even if I look back over the last couple of decades, I would commend the progress made by the industry collectively in building a modern payment system in the country.", "The payment system today is vibrant, robust and technologically superior with multiple payment instruments, multiple access points and delivery channels to choose from.", "However, the benefit of modern payment system is yet to fully percolate to all segments of the society.", "As a result, a substantial portion of the population is still outside the realm of the formal and modern payment system.", "Thus the stage is set for all of us especially the banks and the Indian Banks Association along with other stakeholders in the industry to collaborate with each other in a co-operative effort to expand the reach of banking sector and modern payment systems by making all efforts towards financial inclusion.", "In this endeavour, educating customers on the security comfort afforded by the payment products and the measures required to be taken by the customers for minimising fraud and misuse should also be an integral part.", "Only then would we be able to realise productivity excellence in this sphere which has a direct bearing on sustainable growth of the economy and the percolation of the benefits of this growth to various sections of our citizenry.", "I thank you for your patient hearing."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary
