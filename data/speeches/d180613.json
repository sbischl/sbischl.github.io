see Sargent, 1982).", "So, it comes as no surprise that the Czech National Bank is rarely applauded for cutting interest rates, while hikes are often welcomed by a majority of the population.", "An important publicrelations test arose for the Bank in 2013, when interest rate cuts proved insufficient to return inflation to the target.", "Inspired partly by one distinguished member of today's panel, the Czech National Bank adopted an exchange rate commitment to keep the currency from appreciating.", "The commitment was terminated a year ago.", "Since then, studies by the IMF and academics alike have pointed to large benefits of the policy in terms of reducing unemployment, lifting GDP growth, and preventing deflation.", "Within two years after the commitment's enactment, the Czech Republic - at least in part thanks to the commitment - turned from a de facto sick man of Europe to one of the fastest-growing economies with the lowest unemployment rate in the entire EU.", "When I attend conferences and seminars at other central banks, my foreign colleagues often assume that such a policy must have been tremendously popular.", "Indeed, the economics behind it is straightforward, and the resulting boost to peoples' wages is hard to deny.", "In spite of that, the exchange rate commitment caused the sharpest ever deterioration of public confidence in the Czech National Bank: from around 75% to around 50%.", "Confidence only recovered after the commitment was terminated.", "These were precisely the times when its hard-won independence had to be put to work.", "Thus, central bank independence built into the country's law code is a treasure without which price stability is rarely possible.", "But equally important is the perception of independence by central bankers themselves.", "This perception, in turn, depends on the compatibility of the monetary policy regime with the preferences of the population.", "It is often overlooked, however, that central bankers have an impact on these preferences.", "Rhetoric matters a great deal, and communication is now one of the most potent tools of monetary and other policy.", "True, enhancing financial literacy and altering public preferences in the process is a thankless, tiresome, long-term job, one that is often only appreciated years or even decades later.", "The man responsible for instilling a low-inflation mentality in Czechs, Alois Ras\u030ci\u0301n, was shot dead in 1923 by a young communist.", "At that time, Ras\u030ci\u0301n's policies were very unpopular among some groups of the population.", "But nowadays his legacy underpins the thinking of Czechs about inflation, for better or worse, and through that, the stability of the Czech currency.", "Thank you for your attention.", "Ichiro Iwasaki & Akira Uegaki, 2017.", "\"Central Bank Independence and Inflation in Transition Economies: A Comparative Meta-Analysis with Developed and Developing Economies,\" Eastern European Economics vol.", "\"The Ends of Four Big Inflations,\" NBER Chapters, in: Inflation: Causes and Effects, pages 41-98, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["central bank independence", "monetary policy", "inflation", "price stability", "communication", "financial literacy", "public preferences", "exchange rate", "deflation", "economic growth"]}
