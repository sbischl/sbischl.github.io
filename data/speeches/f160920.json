even though it was initially founded with the primary objective of fostering monetary stability - financial stability considerations ranked high at a very early stage.", "Today it is clear - and has been at least since 2008 -

the reform of the Financial Services Authority in 2001 was a landmark event in this respect - but also Germany and Belgium opted for a separate authority outside the central bank.", "Other countries, like Ireland, assigned unified prudential supervision to their central banks.", "Overall, however, before the financial crisis there seems to have been some preference for independent financial supervisory authorities, while after the financial crisis more countries went toward putting prudential supervision under the authority of their central banks.", "In this respect, the most radical changes took place in Hungary, and again in the U.K., where the prudential regulation of financial institutions was integrated back into the Bank of England in 2013.", "Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks.", "The issue is far from being settled, and in fact there are many reasons to think that there is not one-size-fits-all solution as every arrangement has to work within a specific economic and political context.", "It is with these questions in mind that I would like to conclude my introductory remarks and hand over to Jaime Caruana.", "I wish all of us a successful conference with stimulating presentations and discussions.", "Jaime, the floor is yours."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Monetary policy", "Financial stability", "Globalization", "Central banking", "BIS", "Financial crises", "Banking supervision", "Price stability", "Economic integration", "Exchange rates"]}
