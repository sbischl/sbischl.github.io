long-term nature than the surrounding Alps?", "And Lake Geneva represents a perfectly balanced level of liquidity - while central bankers have to deal with the contradiction of abundant global monetary liquidity and a shortage of market liquidity in certain asset classes.", "But without further ado, let me embark in today's topic.", "Need for clarification: the often forgotten strengths of the euro area Some countries in the euro area face a combination of high levels of indebtedness, budget deficits and weak or absent growth.", "Amid growing market turmoil and the risk of contagion an

Union experienced severe social frictions when they were exposed to the dynamics of pedigreed free markets without the prior set-up and implementation of a sound legal system.", "Beyond this

recently.", "All these reasons represent the foundation why Governments try to avoid a default by all means.", "By consequence sovereign bonds - in particular in industrialized countries - are generally regarded as a largely risk-free investment.", "They form the basis for the risk free rate not being backed by equity.", "As such they are also the anchor for many transactions and valuations

sovereign bonds would rise sharply affecting the whole specter of credit.", "Last but not least, there are legal considerations.", "Generally, if a government does not service its financial obligations it breaches its legal obligations (independent of the effective lack of enforceability by the creditors already mentioned).", "In the case of the euro area there is an additional trait.", "Article 126 paragraph 1 of the treaty (which is binding for all EU countries not only those whose currency is the Euro) clearly states that a Member State \"shall avoid excessive government deficits\".", "Although there is some scope for interpretation what \"excessive\" means it can hardly be doubted that a deficit that leads to a sovereign default was ultimately excessive.", "Working for the better: Closing the implementation gap ...", "These sound arguments call for the avoidance of a sovereign default by all means.", "But what is to be done instead?", "The superior avenue is a combination of crisis resolution to curtail the panic and prevention measures to regain confidence.", "In more detail this means: 1.", "Those countries under the rescue umbrella have to fully implement the conditions of the respective programs in order to return to a sustainable level of debt and regain competitiveness.", "During the adjustment process they receive financial aid from the Luxembourg based European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).", "In order to eliminate any doubts on the sufficient fire power of the EFSF, governments of the euro area Member States should provide

fundamentally unfounded distortions in the sovereign bonds markets.", "These distortions hamper the smooth functioning of the single monetary policy stance.", "Macroeconomic imbalances and unsustainable fiscal policies must be avoided in the future.", "The recent agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the \"Six Pack\" is a step in the right direction.", "The Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened; imbalances and competitiveness will be monitored at an early stage.", "But this economic governance package falls short of greater automaticity in decision-making that the ECB has long advocated for.", "For the time being, the implementation gap must be closed.", "Most of the above mentioned proposals are mirrored by decisions that have been taken already.", "As soon as possible the new governance rules must be applied completely and rigorously.", "Moreover, the governments of the euro area member states must implement all the decisions of the EU summit of 21 July.", "Swift implementation is a necessary condition to resolve the confidence crisis the euro area currently faces.", "... but being prepared for the worst: increasing resilience and ring fencing Nevertheless, if a countries debt burden becomes unsustainable, a restructuring of sovereign debt cannot be excluded as ultimate resort.", "To be prepared for the worst, several lines of defense have to be strengthened: 1.", "In order to mitigate foreseeable tensions in the financial industry, banks have to clean their balance sheets as quickly as possible.", "They need to build up a stronger equity position by retaining profits and moderation in remunerations, bonus payments in particular.", "Preferably they can search for recapitalization via capital markets.", "If this is not feasible, Government must step in to recapitalize solvent banks.", "Where it would be necessary, the EFSF can be approached to recapitalize banks.", "It must be crystal clear that in the unlikely case of a restructuring of one country, this would be a unique case.", "The impression that restructuring was a standard instrument of the crisis management tool kit must be avoided by all means.", "In order to do so, countries with elevated debt levels would have to speed up their consolidation efforts to send out signals of credibility to the markets.", "Sound and credible public finances are the best way to ring fence from markets suspicion.", "In any case it is advisable to avoid any restructuring that is not purely voluntary or that shows elements of compulsion, and to avoid any credit events and selective default or default.", "Rather, the Member States of the euro area need to demonstrate their determination to their own individual sovereign signature, in order to ensure financial stability in the currency union a whole.", "Concluding remarks The epicenter of the global financial crisis has shifted from the US to the euro area.", "The rapid spreading of the crisis is reducing the options at hand to tackle the crisis.", "Europe has already taken important decisions to improve its crisis resolution mechanism and to strengthen preventive measures to avoid macroeconomic imbalances and unsustainable fiscal policies.", "It is important to implement these rules now and make the institutions operational, as markets tend to lose patience.", "There is a strong appetite for a comprehensive solution.", "The banking sector must increase its resilience against sudden, external shock.", "This is particularly important in times of high market volatility and elevated uncertainty.", "Quick action is needed to clean up banks' balance sheets and recapitalize them, where it is deemed necessary.", "On top, countries with elevated debt levels and augmented budget deficits have to put public finances on a more sustainable path and spur growth by structural reform.", "Sovereign defaults should be avoided as the cost most likely would outbalance the benefits by far.", "The ECB has repeatedly objected to all concepts of debt restructuring that are not purely voluntary or that have elements of compulsion; any credit events and selective default or default should be avoided.", "A strong and transparent commitment to sound public finances is the best weapon to combat market attacks.", "Thank you for your attention."],
