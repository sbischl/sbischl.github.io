regulatory capital requirements for the insurance industry is only now being developed.", "Even when the Central Bank formally took over regulation of the industry, the legislation had limitations with respect to on-site supervision (and formally it still does not); While the legislation did not restrict related party transactions, there were significant deficiency or loopholes and this was, perhaps CLICO's greatest vulnerability; and It is silent on the issue of actuarial methodology, which allowed companies to use their own standards which could result in a lower Statutory Fund requirement.", "As the Bank and the industry proceeded to work on a new Insurance Act, we tried to achieve, by moral suasion, what would have been mandatory under appropriate legislation.", "Thus for We insisted on on-site inspections of CLICO; In the face of concerns about risk management and inadequate controls, we insisted on the appointment of independent directors and other measures to improve corporate governance; Concerned about the excessive reliance on short-term funding, the Bank required CLICO to cease sale and the renewal of a particular deposit product;
