a timely and ambitious document which requires cooperation also at Riigikogu level.", "Taking into account that government expenditure as a ratio to GDP has soared, budget adjustment must be done primarily on the expenditure side.", "Tax revenue increases may support the adjustment, but they should not play the main role.", "If only tax advances were used to finance costs at the current level, Estonia's long-term economic growth would be imperilled.", "Also, we support the principles of the current tax policy, according to which the share of indirect and pollution taxes would increase on account of direct taxes.", "I would like to emphasise once again that the measures taken over the past half a year in both the public and the private sector have improved Estonia's ability to exit the crisis.", "This is confirmed by the fact that most of the rating agencies as well as the IMF's recent mission to Estonia have expressed positive assessments of Estonia's economic outlooks.", "To
