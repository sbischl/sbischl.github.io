weather events are insured.", "That leaves 65% of economic losses uninsured.", "This begs the question: will these climate risks still be insurable for the sector or even be affordable for consumers in the future?", "And what can we do about those potential uninsured losses?", "Are we doing enough to address this issue?", "And then there is the transition to a sustainable economy.", "This transition also exposes insurers and pension funds to risks from adapting to new climate policies, rapidly advancing carbon-neutral technology and changing market conditions.", "But a low carbon

sustainability.", "A DNB study has shown that most Dutch institutions now publish an ESG report.", "I know that Dutch institutions are not alone in this.", "Institutions have developed a method to measure the carbon footprint of their investments and loans.", "They do this through the Platform for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).", "The Platform helps financial institutions to disclose and
