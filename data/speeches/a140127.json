complaints against charging of exorbitant interest rates, raising of surrogate deposits under the garb of non-convertible debentures, various types of preference shares, Tier II Bonds, etc.", "Aggressive practices in re-possessing of automobiles in the case of auto loans and improper/opaque practices in selling the underlying gold jewellery in the case of gold loans are the two categories in which relatively more complaints are received / are being received by the Reserve Bank.", "NBFCs are often found not to practice Fair Practices Code (FPC) in letter and spirit.", "Developing a responsive and proper grievance redressal mechanism is the more important agenda in the context of this action point.", ".2 Camouflaging public deposits NBFCs have been prone to adopt variety of instruments/ways of accepting camouflaged public deposits for resource mobilisation viz., use of Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares (CRPS)/ Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) / NCDs / Tier 2 capitals.", "These instruments are generally marketed as any other deposit products mostly by agents.", "Regulators should distinguish tiny differences in a clear manner to check and control NBFCs which are raising resources through camouflaged public deposits.", "Furthermore, complaints are received that deposit receipts issued to customers reveal that the deposits are accepted on behalf of other group companies, whose operations are neither known / are opaque.", ".3 Improving corporate governance standards To become real game changers, business transparency is inevitable for any financial entity.", "In the case of NBFCs, there is an imperative for adopting good corporate governance practices.", "RBI has already prescribed a governance code for NBFCs as part of their best practices; these include constitution of Risk Management, Audit and Nomination Committees, disclosure and transparency.", "When due diligence was undertaken on significant shareholders and directors at the time of registration it was observed there are no prescriptions for qualifications for directors, change in directors etc.", ".4 Capacity building NBFCs on both individual and collective basis need to work towards building a responsive ecosystem for capacity building; since in the medium to long term, it is the quality of staff which to a large extent, determines the health of the sector.", ".5 Greater innovation Although NBFCs have been designing innovative products to suit the client and market conditions, the sophistication of financial services has been gradually increasing in the recent past.", "There is an imperative need for NBFCs to aggressively involve in designing innovative products to become real game changers in the economy.", "In this context, a cue may be taken from the description of daily financial lives of poor people given in detail in \"Portfolios of the Poor,\" a prominent investigation into the everyday problems which they face (Collins, Kulkarni and Gavron (2009)).", "It is stated therein that typical low income families used some 10 different financial instruments, several channels of transport for money and multiple ways of keeping money safe.", "Their fundamental protection against financial risk is diversification, knowledge about counterparties and the judicious exploitation of relationships that are expected to last.", "NBFCs should closely study such behaviour of poor people taking advantage of the last mile connectivity which they do possess, to craft innovative products.", ".6 White label ATMs As NBFCs already have significant business presence in semi-urban and rural centres, there is a case for them to explore business potential by establishing white label ATMs in such areas.", ".7 Need for a single representative body for the industry In the case of NBFCs, there are multiple representative bodies such as \"Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) for Assets Finance Companies\", \"Association of Gold Loan Companies (AGLOC) for Gold Loan NBFCs\", etc.", "In addition, RBI has recently issued guidelines for \"Self-Regulatory Organisation for Micro Finance Institutions\".", "At this stage of development of the NBFC sector, in the interests of harmonious development of all its segments, establishing one representative body for the entire sector would be an idea worth exploring by subsuming the existing bodies.", "However, care should be taken to ensure that all segments are adequately represented in such an apex body, to promote harmonious and balanced growth of the sector and avoid internecine conflicts.", ".8 Coparcener with RBI and other regulators NBFCs should become coparcener with RBI and other regulators and disclose the challenges they are confronting in the markets and provide valuable inputs to regulators for developing conducive regulatory environment.", "Role of Regulators Regulators too need to act on certain issues to enable the NBFC sector to become Real Game Changers.", ".9 Regulators as consumer advocates and as also prudential regulators In the context of NBFCs, customer protection issues take the centre stage as can be seen from paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 above.", "Hence regulators need to wear two hats in the context of NBFCs viz.", "being consumer advocates as also prudential regulators.", "The need to become consumer advocates need hardly any overemphasis in the context of the various issues highlighted in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 above.", "As regards the role of a prudential regulator, they need to take care of individual NBFCs (micro prudential) as also the system as a whole (macro prudential regulations).", ".10 Enhanced monitoring The regulators should have a hands-on approach in unearthing the activities of unauthorised entities as also authorised entities undertaking non-permitted activities.", "In this context, wherever possible, laws may need to be amended to bestow the requisite regulatory and supervisory powers to the respective regulators.", ".11 Regulatory convergence All the concerned regulators should bring about regulatory convergence among themselves, to avoid any possible regulatory arbitrage by the players.", ".12 Higher level of co-ordination All the regulators should actively strive to bring about higher level co-ordination amongst themselves on a continuous basis, so that regulatory gaps and overlaps could be identified at the very earliest and immediate corrective action taken thereon.", "Section 6: The way forward & concluding thoughts NBFCs are already game changers, as can be seen from the analysis above in areas of financial inclusion, especially micro finance, affordable housing, second hand vehicle finance, gold loans and infrastructure finance.", "NBFCs can play a vital role going forward, in closing the loop as regards financial inclusion for individuals and MSMEs.", "As regards individuals, NBFCs can reach various financial products offered by the securities industry, viz., shares, mutual funds, depository services etc., as also insurance products both life and non-life together with their current product offerings.", "As regards MSMEs, NBFCs can become game changers by providing factoring and bill payment service which are of critical importance at the present juncture.", "The way forward is to ensure that both the NBFI sector and all the concerned regulators play an active part in attending on the imperatives mentioned at Section 5 above.", "The complimentary role of the financial sector and all the regulators hardly needs overemphasis in the context of NBFCs morphing as game changers for providing the last mile connectivity and closing the loop as regards financial inclusion.", "In this context, NBFCs have a special responsibility against the background of the need to improve the customer service by conducting their operations as per the best practices of corporate governance.", "In the ultimate analysis, adhering to best corporate governance and ethical practices is the only way for gaining the confidence of their customers in particular, and the society in general.", "Consequently, the NBFC sector would be able to garner greater trust of both its customers and the society.", "That would provide the springboard for increasing their business levels in the process of fulfilling their role as game changers in the areas mentioned above.", "NBFCs becoming true game changers would be a sweetener for financial inclusion efforts in our country."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
