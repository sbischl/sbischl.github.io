perhaps reviewing our medium-term target to a lower level, and economic growth.", "Monetary policy will remain vigilant to deal with inflation pressures should they emerge.", "Further, the Bank of Ghana has taken steps to build reserve buffers, to address potential risks from the external or domestic sectors.", "Currently, the country's gross international reserves is estimated at around US$8 billion and expected to increase with additional inflows from the cocoa syndicated loan.", "We are also deepening the foreign exchange market through the introduction of new products to improve liquidity and ensure stability in the local currency.", "Mr. President, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, beyond these broad policy objectives, I believe some of the pertinent issues that should help entrench macroeconomic stability and allay fears of the investment community and private sector will be fully addressed during the plenary sessions.", "These include sustaining macroeconomic stability through election cycles; infrastructural development to support the productive sector and trade; digitisation of the economy to enhance efficiency; scaling up human capital development which is critical for sustainable growth and development, and last but not least, sustaining financial stability after the clean-up exercise.", "I believe that we will have fruitful deliberations from the distinguished panellists assembled for the various sessions."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Macroeconomic stability", "Inflation", "Monetary policy", "Fiscal policy", "Economic growth", "Financial stability", "Banking sector", "Trade-offs", "Reserve buffers", "Digitisation"]}
