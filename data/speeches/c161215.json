managers may award themselves huge salaries or bonuses unjustified by their actual contribution to the success of the \uf0b7 managers of a firm might evade paying its proper tax liabilities.", "These actions are damaging not just because they transfer resources from outsiders to insiders of a firm, but also they create incentives for actions which are socially sub-optimal.", "For example, if minority shareholders fear that they will be cheated by controlling shareholders, they will not invest their money in a company and in a society in which the interests of minority shareholders are not protected, it will not be possible for firms to raise equity capital except through internally generated funds.", "The essence of corporate governance is to ensure that the actions of a firms insiders its managers and controlling shareholders are consistent with the legitimate interests of all of its stakeholders, and do not benefit the insiders at the expense of outsiders.", "Corporate governance is not the only defence against abuse by insiders; there are also legal restraints, for example there are laws to prevent fraud and ensure minimum standards of health and safety in the workplace.", "But it is not realistic to expect the legal system alone to prevent all possible abuses by insiders; this would be very costly and cumbersome.", "Hence there is a need for standards of corporate governance which extend beyond the strictly legal obligations of a firm.", "The banking industry presents unique challenges for corporate governance because the scope for conflicts of interest between insiders and outsiders is larger than in many other industries.", "The scope for conflicts of interest arises for several reasons.", "The balance sheets of financial institutions are opaque which makes it hard for outsiders such as depositors to evaluate their true financial condition.", "There are informational asymmetries with insiders having more accurate information than outsiders.", "Outsiders typically consist of atomised individuals which mean that they face \"collective action\" problems which impede their acting together in an optimal manner to defend their interests.", "As a consequence, the insiders of financial institutions have opportunities to exploit outsiders in a manner which creates negative externalities such as bank failures or even financial crises.", "For example, a bank may be managed in a reckless manner with any gains made as a result of taking excessive risks accruing to the owners and managers of the bank while any losses are borne by its depositors or taxpayers if they have to bail out the bank.", "To mitigate the conflicts of interest in financial institutions and avoid negative externalities, governments impose prudential regulations, such as minimum capital adequacy requirements for banks, and mandate a public agency to supervise financial institutions and enforce the regulations.", "But we also recognise that statutory bank regulation and supervision by a public agency such as the Bank of Uganda cannot be expected, on its own, to guarantee the sound management of banks.", "Moreover, excessively heavy handed regulation, although it might protect depositors, can also stifle innovation and risk taking in banks, which would be detrimental to economic development.", "In a market economy, the onus for sound management, including the proper management of risks, must lie with the banks themselves.", "Bank regulators cannot be a substitute for bad bank managers.", "As such good corporate governance is an essential complement to good bank regulation and supervision.", "The Financial Institutions Act, 2004, includes a framework for good corporate governance in financial institutions, which is supplemented by a set of corporate governance regulations which were issued by the BOU in 2005.", "Uganda's corporate governance regulations for financial institutions were influenced by the guidelines published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, based at the Bank for International Settlements, which is responsible for formulating global standards for bank regulation and governance.", "The corporate governance regulations for deposit taking financial institutions in Uganda focus on four key themes: i) The fiduciary responsibilities of the Board of Directors; ii) The importance of independent oversight of bank management; iii) The priority which must be attached to risk management; and iv) The need for independent audit functions.", "These are also themes which receive emphasis in the King IV report, which I believe should be viewed as a complement to the corporate governance requirements which are already in place for the Ugandan financial sector.", "The King IV report also includes features which, although not specifically covered in our own corporate governance regulations because they fall outside the ambit of prudential concerns, are nevertheless relevant for financial institutions as well as non financial corporations; these include the importance of corporations establishing responsible and transparent tax policies and organisation wide remuneration policies.", "The King IV Report should help to strengthen standards of corporate governance both in the financial sector and in the non financial corporate sectors of our economy.", "Prof. Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile GOVERNOR"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Corporate Governance", "Economic Development", "Positive Externalities", "Negative Externalities", "Bank Regulation", "Bank Supervision", "Financial Institutions", "Risk Management", "King IV Report", "Board of Directors"]}
