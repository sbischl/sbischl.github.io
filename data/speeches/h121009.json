Growth, competitiveness and innovation.", "At first I thought of how broad the topic was, especially when taken against the very specific mandate of the BSP.", "And then it dawned on me that because market innovation is driven by your members' \"animal spirits\", this topic squares quite well with the motivation to our work as a central bank...which has to do with the channels of transmission of monetary policy.", "The better known or more familiar channels of transmission of monetary policy are - interest rate, exchange rate, credit, asset prices and expectations.", "But there is one more channel that is less-talked-about but which has recently become prominent both in the literature and in global real world practice.", "This is the \"risk taking channel of policy\", which has gained ground during this prolonged period of low global interest rates.", "Let me illustrate why this has been so.", "First, the low interest rate environment encourages agents to take more risk than they normally would...just to enhance yield on their portfolio.", "Second, low interest rates affect asset valuations... and therefore modify credit worthiness of some corporates.", "These in turn encourage the structuring of financial products (through derivatives) for projects that may not normally meet credit standards.", "A global example of the risk taking channel is the now-familiar story of the mortgage crisis in the US.", "While a bank that securitized its mortgages freed up liquidity trapped in its non-tradable long-term receivables, the value chain of continued securitization and re-securitization proved to be very vulnerable to price shocks.", "Nobody quite imagined that the loss in the value of that single underlying collateral could become wholesale.", "Nobody quite foresaw that we would get a global crisis, the socio-economic dislocations arising from which would not have yet fully abated nearly five years since it began.", "Closer to home, the example we can cite is market behaviour reflected in the magnitude and speed of capital flows into the country.", "Accommodative monetary conditions in advanced economies, the weak US employment picture, and the still-unresolved European crisis continue to direct investors to re-balance their portfolios...
