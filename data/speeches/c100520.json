provides a better starting point.", "With ample state coffers, the Norwegian economy was to a considerable extent insulated from the effects of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.", "Norway has had room for manoeuvre because solid state finances secure credibility and because inflation expectations are firmly anchored.", "Even though oil prices fell from close to USD 150 per barrel in summer 2008 to almost USD 30 at the end of the year, Norway's state finances were not called into question.", "In addition, oil prices increased markedly as early as spring last year.", "The oil fund mechanism curbs the effects of oil price fluctuations on demand and output - as well as on inflation and the krone exchange rate.", "The Government Pension Fund Global is also an important source of funding for public spending in the next decades.", "Reductions in government welfare spending, which will probably be a matter of necessity with an increasingly ageing population, will be smaller than would have been the case without the fund.", "Challenges to the Norwegian economy In the period 1992-2008 the Norwegian economy experienced a long upturn.", "In the 2000s, the cost level started to rise, partly reflecting a sharp improvement in our terms of trade.", "Prices for Norwegian goods, such as oil, gas, metals, minerals and fish increased sharply while import prices fell.", "Looking

"Norwegian labour has never been as costly as today.", "Measured against Norway's trading partners, the cost level is almost 20 per cent higher than the average for Norway's oil age.", "Norwegian enterprises will often lose contracts abroad with the current high level of spare capacity in other countries.", "During the upturn, Norwegian enterprises fared well in spite of high costs because they increased efficiency and because sales were strong and prices high.", "Norwegian labour has been very costly, but nevertheless fully employed.", "Market conditions will become more demanding ahead.", "Even with a floating exchange rate, we cannot expect any substantial decline in Norway's relatively high cost level as economic conditions are even weaker in other countries in our region.", "The industry structure in Norway is different from that of other advanced economies.", "We benefit from growth in Asian countries because of our sizeable commodity exports and freight industry.", "We are vulnerable to a slowdown in growth in Asia, which could lead to a fall in commodity prices and deterioration in our terms of trade.", "Norway's high cost level may at the same time make it difficult for the business sector to shift to new markets.", "The economic geography of Norway will change over the next 10-15 years.", "The domestic cost level and low growth in Europe will bring pressure to bear on jobs and businesses in manufacturing communities.", "Job losses will have the most pronounced effects in areas where manufacturing has the highest concentration.", "Entire manufacturing sectors may be lost.", "The key policy rate was reduced substantially in order to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis on the Norwegian economy.", "This contributed to a pickup in economic growth.", "There are prospects that inflation over some time will remain fairly close to the inflation target.", "The downturn in Norway proved to be mild and unemployment has not moved up to a high level.", "Developments in Europe are also amplifying the uncertainty concerning the outlook for the Norwegian economy.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none",
