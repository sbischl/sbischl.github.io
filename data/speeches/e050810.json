China was founded, professor Huang Da began to conduct education and research activities on finance.", "With a scrupulous attitude, he has long conducted research on theoretical and empirical issues of China's money, banking, price, public finance and macroeconomic development, etc.", "His research work has been essential to the development of fiscal and finance research framework and the

topics are to be studied, giving rise to crucial tasks for scholars in the field of finance.", "Nevertheless, I would like to stress that researchers are also lucky as they are in a transition period

time.", "This is not only a precious opportunity, but also a great challenge.", "Modern economic and financial theory emerged in the western countries after long-term observation and research by western economists.", "The theory is subject to relatively strict conditions, which may not be appropriate in China's practice.", "Nevertheless, we believe that China's financial researchers will take a scrupulous attitude and not confine to the existing theories and historical experiences.", "With these efforts, theoretical development will be brought to a new stage on the basis of China's reform practice, giving rise to financial theory development in the world.", "Passion is needed in the reform, while cool mind is necessary for research.", "Researchers need to be objective, independent and scrupulous with the research work.", "Economic and financial performance involves the interaction of interests of different parties.", "The objective of financial theoretical research is to objectively describe the patter of interests and the rule of its change, providing guidance to economic and financial policy making aimed at establishing appropriate incentive mechanisms.", "In this vein, the China Financial Institute will take measures to further mobilize research resources to conduct pioneering study on important theoretical issues with respect to China's reform and development under the support of financial supervisory agencies, commercial banks, securities firms, insurance companies, publishing houses, schools and financial research institutes.", "In conclusion, I wish

theoretic study."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
