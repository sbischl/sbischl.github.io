or livestock.", "Women are less likely to have land titled under their name, even when their families own land, and are less likely than men to have control over land, even when they do formally own it.", "Biased inheritance rights often bestow land to male relatives, leaving both widows and daughters at a disadvantage (Agarwal, 2003).", "Cultural norms and family responsibilities Socially accepted norms and expected family roles have a profound effect on the type of economic activities that women can engage in, the technologies available to them, the people and agencies with whom they can interact, the places they can visit, the time they have available and the control they can exert over their own resources such as capital.", "Biased attitude of banks Women's access to financial resources is also limited by biased lending practices that emerge when financial institutions consider them inexperienced and therefore less attractive clients, or when institutions lack the knowledge to offer products tailored to women's preferences and constraints (Fletschner, 2009).", "Lack of collateral and start-up capital Access of collateral and asset-based lending generally constrains

concentrated in small firms and hence are likely to face greater financial constraints.", "Formal employment Women are significantly underrepresented in secure wage employment in both public and private employment.", "Those who have formal sector jobs are constrained by the reproductive roles they play.", "As a result, majority of women occupy low-level posts that offer them the flexibility they need to manage their households while working in the formal sector.", "They spend most of their time doing unpaid household work, which undermines their business potentials.", "Opportunities for increasing women's access to finance The opportunities for increasing access to finance for women are discussed in terms of the various initiatives of the government and allied agencies that support

banking industry have made in their to efforts to empower women.", "Government initiatives The Federal Government recently launched the Public Works and Women/Youth Empowerment Scheme (PW/WYE).", "The

managerial skills.", "An important priority for governments should be increasing the enrolment of girls across all levels of education complemented by efforts to improve the quality of education that they receive.", "While it is important to build the capacity of financial institutions to better serve women entrepreneurs, it is also imperative that women are provided with the opportunity to be financially literate, so that they can speak the language of finance.", "Women face peculiar exclusion as a result of cultural, religious and social biases that hinder their access to financial services.", "It will be pertinent to explore the possibility of enacting laws that address gender inequality, sexual harassment and discrimination as first step towards improving their access to

intended that a minimum of 60 per cent of the MSMEDF should be committed to providing funding to women in order to address their peculiar financial exclusion challenges.", "The key objectives include providing grants for capacity building of staff in microfinance institutions (MFBs, MFIs and similar institutions) and their apex bodies on women based lending, promoting the development of regulatory

Bank of Nigeria (CBN) appreciates the fact that financial access, inclusion and literacy are cornerstones for reducing poverty.", "To his end, we have taken the lead in developing Nigeria's National Financial Inclusion Strategy to ensure that a clear agenda is set for increasing both access and usage of financial services within a defined timeline for excluded groups including women.", "Indeed, the financial inclusion strategy provides for reducing the exclusion rate of women from 54 per cent to 20 per cent by the year 2020.", "To achieve this, special incentives and provisions would be made available to financial institutions to develop products that would meet the needs of Nigerian women.", "The CBN as part of its developmental efforts supports Entrepreneurship Development Centres (EDC) in the six geo-political zones of the country.", "The bank would endeavour to place more of a focus on women in the implementation of these centres.", "Promoting women into leadership and decision making roles The Bankers' Committee, which comprises of the CBN, Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Deposit Money-Banks and Discount Houses declared 2012 the year of \"Women Economic Empowerment\".", "I am also pleased to report that the Bankers' Committee also now has a dedicated sub-committee focused on women economic empowerment headed by the Chief Executive Officer of Standard Chartered Bank (Nigeria) Limited, Mrs. Bola Adesola.", "One of focus areas of this sub-committee is to facilitate the decision of the Bankers' Committee to ensure that women occupy more leadership positions in the industry.", "Presently, we have a situation where at the junior levels; we have a situation where about 42% of the junior roles in the industry are held by women.", "Unfortunately, as they move on to middle and senior management roles, this starts to diminish to 31 and 27 per cent respectively.", "We have collectively agreed that by 2014, 40 per cent of senior management and 30 per cent of board level positions should be occupied by women.", "As we strive towards the improvement of the lot of African women, we must continue to extend their participation in leadership positions in the public and private sectors.", "The Federal Government of Nigeria has shown some leadership in this regard through the appointment of 16 women as Ministers in the cabinet.", "The CBN in recent years has also provided some leadership for the banking industry through its appointment of up to seven female directors in some cases to head departments that have been seen as traditionally male dominated environments.", "It is instructive to note that the CBN is coming from a position where it has only had four directors between 1959, the year of its establishments and 2009, when it celebrated 50 years of existence.", "Ladies and gentlemen, as in other developing nations of the world, women in Nigeria are faced with numerous socio-economic challenges some of which were discussed in this paper.", "One of the potent solutions to these menaces is the empowerment of women for active participation in economic activities.", "Lack of finance has been identified as one major limiting factor to women entrepreneurship development.", "Therefore, I used this speech to highlight some of the challenges of accessing finance for women.", "I have also mentioned the available avenues for providing financial encouragement to women.", "It does not stop there.", "The Central Bank also encourages advocacy for institutional support to women empowerment.", "And as you are aware, small and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in market economies are the engine of growth and development.", "SMEs contribute to sustainable growth and employment generation in a significant manner due to their private ownership, entrepreneurial spirit, flexibility and adaptability as their potential to react to challenges and changing environments in a competitive market frame work.", "Women occupy pivotal positions in SMEs.", "Increasing access to finance for women-owned or operated businesses is a sound strategy for financial institutions if they are to establish a foothold in the SME space.", "Therefore, supporting women entrepreneurship by means of training and granting financial support is a key step to take towards guaranteeing the contribution of women to national economic development.", "I thank New Faces New Voices and the African Development Bank (ADB) for organizing this forum and the opportunity to speak and I would like to end by urging a concerted effort to
