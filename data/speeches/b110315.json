consistent with the African Landscape and to drive development in the sector.", "Allow me now to briefly share with you Kenya's experience on Ladies and Gentlemen: innovations in the banking sector.",

will also be able to use their positive credit history to negotiate for better terms and conditions from their banks.", "On the other hand, banks will benefit from the mechanism since it will address the problem of information asymmetry and by extension the problem of non-performing loans which has in the past threatened the stability of the banking sector.", "The traditional challenges of the moral hazard and adverse selections can hinder financial sector growth.", "Licensing of deposit taking microfinance institutions (DTMs), whose focus is the lower end of the market, which is

mobilization.", "\uf0b7 Several modalities including establishment Lowering the cost of doing business: of three currency centers in towns outside the key Kenyan cities to lower cash in transit costs

experienced a structural transformation.", "This transformation is evidenced by the following achievements: Exponential growth of bank branches from 740 in 2007 to 1,063 as at end of 2010.", "\uf0b7

financial sector has not Ladies and Gentlemen: been achieved on a silver platter.", "There has always been the task of surmounting prevalent challenges.", "Key among these is the need to balance the goals of financial efficiency, stability and integrity on one side with financial inclusion on the other.", "The pursuit of these goals requires delicate balancing given their importance.", "However, as already alluded, balancing of these goals is made easier when regulators embrace their new role of being a market developer in addition to their traditional regulatory role.", "A developing

adequate disclosure of information by providers of financial services, efficient dispute resolution mechanisms, comparability of offers and data protection.", "As financial regulators embrace innovations in their jurisdictions, there is need to ensure that the innovations have adequate consumer protection safeguards.", "Kenya's new constitution promulgated in August 2010 entrenches consumer protection in the Bill of Rights and mandates Parliament to enact consumer protection legislation.", "But in addition the constitution allows for strong institutions and protects them.", "Strong institutions define appropriate incentives and the rules of the game to encourage prudent behavior.", "This is good for the financial market to allow defined entry and orderly exit from this important market.", "Ladies and Gentlemen: As I conclude, let me reiterate that innovative solutions for strengthened regulatory framework for a financial sector lie with the players.", "The regulators, the regulated and market participants should think outside the box.", "They exist for each other and it is only through their acceptance to promote, advise and partner that a smarter regulatory framework is put in place that enables the private sector to prosper.", "With these remarks, Ladies and Gentlemen, I take this opportunity to wish you fruitful deliberations while I look forward to receiving the forum's report in due course for us to consider the relevant innovative solutions tailored to our circumstances."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
