as far as possible - avoid creating incentives for moral hazard behaviour.", "For domestic policy-makers, this means that international assistance must not be seen as insurance either against dangerous exchange rate experiments or against a loss of credibility.", "For the markets, there should as few incentives as possible to underrate country-specific risks based on the hope of a later bail-out.", "So, in the first place, financial crisis and systemic risk do not lead to the question of the lender of last resort.", "Instead, they lead to the question how to improve the framework.", "And that was the background to my report I presented to the Group of Seven (G-7) Ministers and Governors at their meeting in Bonn on February 20, 1999.", "Professor Illing asked me to add some remarks on that report.", "I will follow that suggestion.", "As you know, my proposal to the G-7 included convening a Forum of Financial Stability.", "What is the philosophy behind that proposal?", "Firstly, there is the conviction that sweeping institutional changes are not necessary.", "Instead, a process to improve coordination between existing national and international authorities and groupings is important for improving the functioning of the market and, in doing so, promoting the stability of the financial system.", "Secondly, a permanent body which brings together major experts on supervisory issues, either technical or political representatives, either at the national or at the international level has more potential to be a driving force for practical change than several ad-hoc-groups may have.", "How is the Forum composed?", "Members of the Forum are: representatives of the IFIs, the BIS and the OECD, representatives of key international regulatory groupings, namely the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, IOSCO, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, central bank experts concerned with market infrastructure from the Committee on Payment & Settlement Systems and the Committee on the Global Financial System and - not least - representatives of the national authorities - the ministries of Finance, central banks and senior supervisory authorities - initially of the G-7 countries.", "What is the Forum's field of activity?", "The G-7 report identifies three areas where improvement is necessary.", "The first potential area concerns the assessment of vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system.", "These kinds of information-pooling-and-processing activity must be clearly separated from normal macro-economic policy assessment.", "The Forum should obviously not attempt the IMF's systematic surveillance of individual countries, although cases may arise where financial vulnerabilities in individual counties merit the Forum's attention.", "A second potential area of activity for the Forum is identifying and overseeing actions needed to address the vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system, including encouraging the development or strengthening of international best practice and standards and defining priorities for addressing and implementing them.", "A third potential area of activity for the Forum is improving mutual coordination and the exchange of information among the various authorities responsible for financial stability (a sort of permanent round-table).", "In this respect, the forum should be a vehicle for the regular in-depth exchange of information among the international financial institutions and the international regulatory groupings.", "How should the Forum work?", "The Forum should not duplicate work being undertaken elsewhere.", "The Forum should, rather, work through its members, taking due account of their comparative advantages.", "Specifically, the Forum should bring together information about activities taking place in diverse groupings and coordinate overlapping activities.", "In addition, the Forum should identify gaps in existing work, and propose appropriate means of filling such gaps.", "Finally, the Forum should, wherever possible, aim to produce concrete, implementable recommendations, as distinct from analytical reports stating alternative views.", "And it should monitor the implementation of those recommendations.", "Two particular points have to be addressed further.", "Firstly, the involvement of the private sector.", "The Forum is asked to find flexible ways of drawing on private sector expertise.", "One way is for the Forum to meet with the private sector immediately before or after the meeting.", "It would also be possible for sub-groups of Forum members to meet the private sectors on other occasions.", "Secondly, countries outside the G-7 should be more involved.", "That can be done either be inviting qualified experts from outside the G-7 to contribute to the activities of the Working Groups.", "Or by inviting representatives from national authorities as guests in the forthcoming regular meeting of the Forum.", "In the meanwhile, the first meeting has taken place.", "Upon my proposal, the G-7 Ministers and Governors have appointed Andrew Crockett to be the Chairman of the Forum for three years.", "That guarantees the necessary experience as well as continuity.", "Three Working Groups have been - The Working Group on Highly Leveraged Activities and Institutions; Howard Davis (UK) has the chair.", "- The Working Group on Short-term Capital Flows; Mario Draghi (Italy) has the chair.", "- The Working Group on Offshore Centres; John Palmer (Canada) has the chair.", "The second meeting is scheduled for mid-September.", "I am personally following the work of the Forum with great interest, of course, but also at some distance because from September 1st onwards I shall be only an outside observer, but an interested one.", "And let me end with the following remark: if the Forum can help to improve the international financial framework, it may make a greater contribute to coping with systemic risk than a lender of last resort ever could."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "fiscal dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Systemic risk", "Lender of last resort", "Financial stability", "International cooperation", "Financial crises", "Financial markets", "IMF", "Moral hazard", "Financial supervision", "Global financial system"]}
