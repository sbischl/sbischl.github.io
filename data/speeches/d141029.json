provided for bilateral EOI-on-request, where a jurisdiction may request from another jurisdiction information on its tax payer that is foreseeably relevant to its determination of whether the tax payer has evaded taxes.", "Following that, there has been strong progress towards enhanced tax transparency - most recently, the G20 and OECD advocated the adoption of AEOI as the new global standard for tax transparency (the \"AEOI Standard\"), and urged all jurisdictions, including all financial centres, to implement the AEOI Standard swiftly.", "In fact, G20 members last month, endorsed the

Firstly, implementation must be done under a robust framework of law so as to maintain confidentiality and legitimate use of information exchanged; (ii) Secondly, there must be reciprocity in terms of the scope of information exchanged between jurisdictions; and (iii) Thirdly, AEOI must be endorsed and implemented among all financial centres to provide a level playing field.", "Enhanced tax

the trust industry.", "The critical role of industry 24.", "An AML/CFT regime, no matter how robust, cannot in itself fight against ML/TF activities.", "We need the commitment and active participation

continue working in meaningful partnership with the industry.", "Competency building is also imperative in raising AML/CFT standards amongst industry professionals.", "An effective AML/CFT system cannot be solely the responsibility of compliance professionals or experts, but must be an integral part of the firm's culture.", "Besides the Institute of Banking and Finance (\"IBF\"), certification
