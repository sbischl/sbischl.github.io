{"sentences": ["Last year was surely one of the most memorable years ever experienced by the home mortgage market.", "Owing largely to the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than three decades and rising home prices, close to 10 million of regular home mortgages were refinanced.", "I use the term regular mortgage to exclude both home equity and construction loans.", "The outsized dollar volume of these refinancings - by our estimates, $1-3/4 trillion net of cash-outs - was an all-time record and represented almost one-third of the value of all regular home mortgages outstanding at the beginning of last year.", "Total regular mortgage originations, at $2-1/2 trillion, also proceeded at a record pace.", "As part of 2002's process of refinancing, households \"cashed out\" almost $200 billion of accumulated home equity, net of fees, taxes, points, and commissions.", "That represented almost 3 percent of estimated total home equity at the beginning of the year, up slightly from the 2001 share.", "In no year prior to 2001, as best we can judge, did cash-outs exceed 1-3/4 percent of total home equity.", "Of last year's cash-outs, approximately $70 billion was apparently applied to repayment of home-equity loans, and a significant part was employed to reduce higher-cost credit card debt, judging from the slowed pace of growth in installment debt outstanding.", "Previous Federal Reserve surveys of the disposition of cash-outs indicate that a substantial amount - perhaps half - was used to finance home modernization and personal consumption expenditures, outlays that directly affect GDP and jobs, and that likely was the case again last year.", "Low mortgage rates doubtless motivated much of this spending, but the ready availability of home equity for extraction appears to have also played a substantial and independent role in prompting additional household expenditures.", "Even as recently as the late 1980s, a family that wanted to use housing wealth to finance consumption would have faced an expensive and time-consuming process.", "Although substantial home equity wealth has existed for many years, only in the last decade or so has secured borrowing against home equity become a cost-effective source of credit in a wide variety of circumstances.", "An even greater support to the economy than cash-outs last year was the extraction of home equity associated with a record 6.4 million existing home sales, including condos, at record prices.", "This pace of ownership turnover of the existing housing stock also reflected the near-record-low mortgage rates.", "We estimate that mortgage originations for existing home purchase last year topped $600 billion.", "Subtracting the home sellers' repayments of the remaining debt of their outstanding mortgages, we infer a net increase of approximately $350 billion in debt on the homes that turned over last year.", "That debt increase exactly matches the extraction of previously built-up equity on those homes plus fees and taxes folded into the loans.", "Not surprisingly, the change in mortgage debt is highly correlated with the realized capital gains on the turnover of those homes.", "We do not have a direct measure of how the equity extracted from last year's home turnover was expended.", "It is likely, however, that home sellers, after setting aside a down payment for the family's next home, expended a considerable part of their home equity extraction on goods and services.", "In addition to the extraction of equity financed by regular mortgages last year, approximately $130 billion was drawn through a net increase of home equity loans, also a record, and also presumed to be the consequence of low mortgage rates as well as accelerated appreciation of homes.", "Federal Reserve studies of the disposition of home equity loans suggest a slightly higher rate of repayment of credit card and other consumer nonmortgage debt than our cash-out disposition surveys concluded.", "All in all, the amount of previously built-up equity extracted from owner-occupied homes last year, net of fees and taxes, totaled $700 billion by our calculations, or more than 10 percent of estimated equity at the beginning of the year.", "Home equity extraction for the economy as a whole is, of necessity, financed by debt.", "In fact, the $700 billion of equity extraction is similar to the increase in mortgage debt last year.", "Despite the exceptionally large extraction of equity, the total remaining equity at the end of 2002 was higher in dollar terms than at the beginning of the year, owing to a 7 percent increase in existing home prices over the four quarters of last year and $300 billion in new home construction, net of mortgage extensions on those homes.", "Mortgage debt as a percent of the market value of homes accordingly rose somewhat more than 1 percentage point during the year.", "Mortgage debt service costs as a percent of the disposable income of homeowners last year were little changed from 2001.", "The estimated 10 percent of homeowners' disposable income allocated to mortgage debt service in the third quarter of last year was well below the highs in 1991, though the ratio of homeowners' mortgage debt to their disposable income rose to a record high.", "Refinance and home purchase originations, seasonally adjusted, peaked in the fourth quarter of last year.", "It is difficult to imagine that pace being maintained in the current quarter.", "Seasonally adjusted applications for refinancings, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association, are off their peaks but still impressively high.", "So are home purchase mortgage applications.", "This suggests a somewhat less robust market for mortgage originations this quarter.", "With home price increases now subsiding, and mortgage interest rates no longer declining at last year's impressive pace, some slowdown in the rate of mortgage debt expansion is to be expected.", "That is likely to be the case for equity extraction from home turnover as well.", "As I noted earlier, that extraction appears to parallel the realized capital gains on home sales, which mainly reflect the number of existing home sales.", "Home price change, of course, is also a factor, but it is the average change over the length of occupancy - nearly ten years for the typical homeowner - that matters, not recent price trends.", "Similarly, refinancing and the cash-outs associated with them accelerated last year as the decline in mortgage interest rates on new loans far exceeded the modest decline in the average rate on all outstanding regular home mortgages.", "This wider spread between the current mortgage rate and the rate on outstanding loans, as you all know, markedly increased the incentive to refinance.", "So any stabilizing of rates on new mortgages would narrow the spread as portfolio rates continue to decline as a consequence of continued refinancing at interest rates still below the portfolio average.", "A narrowed spread would likely reduce cash-outs, lessening the level of equity extractions from this source.", "We do not have estimates of total home equity loans beyond the end of last year, but lines of credit at commercial banks - approximately a fourth of total home equity loans - rose during the first 7 weeks of 2003, considerably more than the typical seasonal change.", "In summary, the frenetic pace of home equity extraction last year is likely to appreciably simmer down in 2003, possibly notably lessening support to household purchases of goods and services."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["home equity extraction", "mortgage rates", "home prices", "mortgage originations", "cash-outs", "home equity loans", "mortgage debt", "home turnover", "mortgage interest rates", "refinancing"]}
