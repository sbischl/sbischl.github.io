unemployment and directly promote economic growth.", "The theoretical basis for this was provided by the famous Phillips curve, which depicted an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in Britain; when unemployment was high inflation was low and vice versa.", "This appeared to have suggested that central banks could permanently reduce unemployment by tolerating a bit more inflation.", "In fact, many countries attempted to do so.", "We all have our experience in attempting to directly promote economic activities by releasing high powered money through various credit schemes and direct involvement in development activities.", "However, at the end we had more inflation, either visible or hidden, without an appreciable reduction in unemployment or improvement

necessarily guarantee economic and financial stability.", "With globalization and improvement in productivity, there has been a general tendency for inflation to remain relatively low.", "Though,

ensure financial system stability through an injection of high-powered money could greatly endanger the achievement of price stability.", "Mr. Volcker, former chairman of the Fed Reserve Bank of USA
