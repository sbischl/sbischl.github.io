economies, creating jobs and expanding exports.", "This ended abruptly in 1997, when the Asian Crisis swept through the region.", "But since then, Northeast Asia's economic performance has outshone Southeast Asia's.", "In Southeast Asia, growth has been weaker and more disparate, both direct and portfolio investments have fallen, and ebullience has been replaced by pessimism.", "There are three main reasons.", "A large part of Northeast Asia's strong performance reflects the continuing growth and transformation of the Chinese economy, which largely escaped the Asian Crisis.", "The past few years have witnessed rapid market liberalisation in China, as it prepared itself to join the WTO and bring 1.3 billion people into the global trading system.", "As the Chinese economy grew and showed tangible progress, MNCs have become euphoric over China's potential, both as a production base and an enormous market.", "Accordingly, foreign direct investments have poured into China.", "China still faces daunting problems, for example, in its banking system, state-owned enterprises, and intellectual property rights regime.", "But the dramatic and ongoing changes give investors hope and confidence that these problems will in time be overcome, making them feel that they cannot afford not to be in China.", "A second reason for Southeast Asia's under-performance is the regional political and security situation.", "The Asian Crisis precipitated major social and political changes in many countries, deterring MNCs from committing to new investments in an uncertain climate.", "These overriding political concerns also distracted the governments from tackling urgent economic problems and implementing painful structural reforms to remedy weaknesses uncovered by the crisis.", "In contrast, South Korea's aggressive post-crisis restructuring of its corporate sector has spurred a more rapid recovery.", "Most crucially, the Asian Crisis brought down the Suharto Government in Indonesia, and launched Indonesia on a new and uncharted path.", "For thirty years, a stable Indonesia, with a strong government focused on economic development, had provided a critical basis for confidence and peaceful cooperation in the whole of Southeast Asia.", "Suharto's fall changed this.", "The subsequent Indonesian government abandoned Suharto's longstanding policy of restraining

through violence and terror.", "The recent bomb attack in Bali was a tragic reminder that Southeast Asia is at the frontline of the worldwide war against terrorism.", "A third, more cyclical, factor

dependent on external demand, unlike China.", "But Southeast Asia's main export markets - US, Japan, and the EU - are all languishing.", "The timing and strength of a pickup in the US economy is uncertain, especially given the possibility of a war in Iraq, and the concomitant impact on oil prices and the international security climate.", "The Japanese economy is still mired in difficulties, with no imminent prospect of decisive fundamental change.", "With fiscal and monetary policies constrained by the Maastricht Stability Pact and a stringent inflation target, the EU economy too remains weak.", "Southeast Asia's response These three factors - China's rise, regional political and security problems, and weak external demand - explain Southeast Asia's under-performance, but they do not condemn Southeast Asia to perpetual stagnation.", "How can Southeast Asia overcome these problems?", "First, Southeast Asia should not see China only as a challenge, but also as an opportunity.", "A

Southeast Asia.", "But that does not mean that Southeast Asia will revert to agriculture and primary production.", "Attractive as China is to investors, it will not soak up all manufacturing investments, nor will it out-compete all other countries in every industry and every product.", "More likely, Southeast Asia and China will complement each other in an international division of labour, for example, with Southeast Asia providing the components and intermediate processing, and factories in China doing the final assembly for the Chinese market.", "The desire of MNCs to diversify their investments beyond one or two countries will also promote such an outcome.", "For our part, Singapore is actively positioning itself to benefit from China's growth.", "When Chinese

cloud of suspicion, and the non-Muslims do not treat their Muslim fellow citizens any differently than before.", "Muslim community leaders have come together to publicly condemn the extremists as

external demand by strengthening their access to the major developed markets.", "In the short term, there is little we can do about the cyclical downturn.", "But for the longer term, favourable and

strategies to continue to thrive.", "This is why we convened the Economic Review Committee (ERC), to carry out a comprehensive review of our economic policies, and to identify ways to develop a

better.", "We need to imbue our young with entrepreneurial instincts and attitudes, through their school education and life experiences.", "At the same time, the government should cut red tape, create more economic space for private enterprise, nurture high-potential local enterprises and develop a culture tolerant of risk-taking, experimentation and honest failure.", "A self-renewing, self-sustaining entrepreneurial culture will not emerge overnight, but we are making some headway.", "Ten Singapore companies made it to this year's list of Forbes' Global 200 companies with revenues

identify, nurture and promote new areas of growth in both manufacturing and services, the two complementary engines of our economy.", "The continuing emergence of lower-cost locations spurs us to

uphold corporate governance standards and protect stakeholders' interests.", "I am happy to announce that the government has accepted all the recommendations of this Committee.", "They will ensure that our company law is market-driven, supportive of entrepreneurship and aligned with international best practices.", "The Ministry of Finance will release further details.", "Finally, just as we are encouraging greater corporate disclosure, the government is also working towards raising levels of transparency through consultation and collaboration with the private sector.", "Consultation lengthens the policy-making process and entails commitment of effort and resources on the part of the industry and the public.", "But it also helps to pre-empt implementation problems, minimise unintended consequences, and foster better industry understanding and support.", "The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has introduced guidelines to make public consultation a standard procedure whenever significant changes in the financial services regulatory framework are planned.", "Over time, these changes will further improve the operating environment for the financial sector.", "The MAS will release further details.", "Singapore has not shied away from tough measures to remake our economy and maximise our chances in a difficult environment.", "These measures will enhance our

slump broke the recovery trend.", "But ASEAN economies weathered the downturn fairly well, with most still managing positive GDP growth.", "Most are running current account surpluses, in contrast to the large deficits that prevailed in 1997.", "From a macroeconomic standpoint, the countries have held up well and even shown a certain resilience.", "Reflecting this, ASEAN stockmarkets have generally performed better than their counterparts in the rest of the world thus far this year.", "Part of Southeast Asia's negative image is attributable to political and security concerns, which are indeed real.", "A week or so after the Bali attack, these worries naturally loom large.", "Many observers, seized by the mood of the moment, are now forecasting the worst for the region.", "But we should adopt a longer-term, more nuanced perspective.", "Southeast Asia's economic fundamentals remain positive - a sizeable market with a collective population of 500 million people, high savings, abundant natural resources, under-developed consumer appetites and a strong work ethic.", "The political problems can be overcome, provided governments act swiftly and resolutely to counter terrorism and restore order and confidence.", "Those countries which do so will regain investor interest, while those investors shrewd enough to discern which countries and projects deserve support will be amply rewarded by the risk premiums.", "Provided Southeast Asian countries adapt themselves to their new environment, remedy their economic weaknesses, and grasp the new opportunities, this region can once again become a vibrant part of Asia."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
