(137th out 137 countries) and to work (136th out of 137 countries).", "High tax rates actions encourage the shift of activities towards the shadow economy and provide incentives for tax evasion.",

of state property and improving the tax administration.", "These actions will lead to a fairer distribution of the fiscal burden and will facilitate the reduction of the excessively high tax rates.",

the next two years are ambitious compared to last year, implying that banks will need to step up their efforts and make full use of the available toolkit for private debt resolution.", "Moreover, banks will be facing new challenges in 2018, most notably the implementation of IFRS 9, stricter treatment of loan-loss provisions, as well as stress test to be conducted by the ECB.", "Thus, banks need to step up their efforts to attain their operational targets for reducing their NPLs and, ideally, over-achieve them now that the economy has returned to positive growth.", "In this context, they need to broaden the scope of the workouts they offer to borrowers and make more drastic decisions, in particular with respect to the restructuring of viable businesses, identification of strategic defaulters and the liquidation of nonviable businesses.", "Improving further the business environment and the insolvency framework to enable faster reallocation of productive factors to more productive opportunities.", "Rebalancing of the economy towards tradables heavily relies on the ability to freely and quickly move capital from less profitable to more profitable sectors.", "An

OECD average and the recovery rate is 35%, half the level of the OECD average.", "According to OECD research, Greece has the highest share of capital (and labour) trapped in non-viable companies among OECD countries (27%).", "This suggests that there is a high degree of capital misallocation in the economy, which contributes to lower productivity.", "A necessary condition 6.", "Promoting innovation, education and knowledge-based capital.", "for sustainable growth is the achievement of higher TFP growth.", "In order to foster TFP growth, policy must focus on improving the quality of labour (i.e.", "skills), attracting investment in new technologies and improving the quality of capital through the creation of an institutional framework that supports innovation.", "Given the decline in the cost of labour relative to the cost of capital and the tight financing conditions of companies, the major risk looking forward is that investment will be concentrated in labour-intensive, low-productivity sectors.", "This, however, would trap the economy in a state of low productivity and low growth.", "Hence, innovation, ICT investment and technological progress are important in order to boost productivity in the long run.", "Given the decline in disposable income due to 7.", "Speeding up privatizations to attract FDI.", "the recession and the increased tax burden due to fiscal consolidation, domestic savings are insufficient to meet investment needs which, after a long period of very low investment rates, are significant even though capacity utilization remains low in some sectors.", "Thus, conditions should be established to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).", "One way to do that is by completing quickly privatization projects which are at a mature stage, as well as stepping up the pace of the overall privatization and real estate development programme.", "FDI, besides closing the investment gap, promotes greater trade ties with countries and companies with cutting edgetechnologies.", "This will allow integration of Greek companies into global value chains, increasing openness of the economy and improving both the quantity and quality of Greek exports.", "Supporting the unemployed and enhancing employment and training programmes.", "With unemployment at very high levels, it is essential to provide immediate support to the unemployed and those marginally attached to the labour market by using active labour market policies and targeted social transfers to counter temporary income losses and shorten job transitions.", "In the medium term, emphasis should be placed on skill upgrading and retraining policies to get people back into work.", "Final remarks A major issue in the coming months is the consolidation of confidence and the improvement of which will allow the return of the Greek sovereign to financial the country's creditworthiness, markets on sustainable terms after the end of the programme in August 2018.", "The steps that will make an effective contribution in this direction are: \u2022 First, the implementation of the reform and privatization programme and the preparation for the which will mark the end of the timely conclusion of the fourth and final review, \u2022 Second, the specification of medium-term debt re-profiling measures, which will enable Greece's access to bond markets on sustainable terms and will facilitate the inclusion of Greek government bonds in the ECB's quantitative easing programme.", "\u2022 Third, the complete lifting of capital controls, in connection with the improvement of the economic outlook and depositors' confidence in the Greek banking system.", "New bond issuances, while still in the ESM programme, coupled with the forthcoming ESM disbursements (in line with the June 2017 Eurogroup commitment) could be used to build up a cash buffer to support investors' confidence and facilitate Greece's market access.", "Such a cash buffer would be particularly useful in the event that Greece's credit rating has not improved to investment grade by the end of the programme in August 2018 (currently, five notches lower).", "However, notwithstanding the existence of a cash buffer to consolidate confidence over the medium term, it is important to clarify the environment in which the Greek economy will Under the EU legal framework, Greece will be move after the end of the ESM programme.", "under surveillance at least until it repays 75% of the official loans received from euro area countries, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).", "Therefore, it remains to be clarified first, the form of supervision in the conduct of economic policy and, second, whether and on what conditions precautionary financial support from the partners will be available after the completion of this program.", "According to the Bank of Greece, such a precautionary support framework could assist the Greek economy by further driving down borrowing costs, as it will provide assurance of Greece's access to financing after the end of the programme in August 2018, especially if international financial market conditions deteriorate.", "It will also allow the ECB to maintain the waiver on Greek government bonds after the end of the programme and eventually include Greek government bonds in its asset purchase programme in the normal or/and in the reinvestment period.", "Maintaining the waiver is, in the Bank of Greece's view, important for the smooth financing of Greek banks as long as Greece's credit rating remains lower than investment grade, as even repo operations are facilitated by the waiver.", "The ongoing reform and fiscal adjustment effort is bearing fruits.", "The macroeconomic imbalances have now been corrected, important and long-needed reforms have been implemented, competitiveness has improved and the banking sector is adequately capitalized.", "However, we still have some way to go in order for Greece to tap the financial markets on sustainable terms after the end of the programme in August 2018.", "I am confident that the actions I have just described will improve Greece's creditworthiness, boost the investment and business climate, facilitate the return to financial normality, and will contribute to the sustainable
