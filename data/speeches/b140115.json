"Congress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978.", "The amended Federal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC \"shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\"", "Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at full employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to manage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in the long run.", "Economic conditions In order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the FOMC must monitor economic developments.", "So, let me turn to an assessment of our economy.", "As we enter 2014, I think the bottom line is that the economy is on firmer footing than it has been for the past several years.", "Real output grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter of last year, the strongest gain in nearly two years and a marked acceleration from the first half of 2013.", "Some of this growth came in the form of inventory investment, which is volatile and is less likely to have contributed as much to growth in the fourth quarter.", "Still, personal consumption and fixed investment provided positive contributions, and economic prospects at the end of last year and the beginning of this year are positive.", "Personal consumption, which accounts more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter.", "Some observers have lamented at the lack of stronger growth in consumption.", "But I would note that consumption growth has not fluctuated that much over the course of the recovery.", "I am encouraged by the U.S. consumers' persistence in the face of many challenges, including a payroll tax hike last January, a government shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and the implications of health-care reform.", "Consistent job growth has added to wage and salary growth, which has supported spending.", "The December employment report released last Friday, which showed payroll gains of 74,000 jobs, came in below many analysts' expectations.", "Yet, I caution you not to read too much into one month's number.", "December's number was likely affected by the unseasonably cold and snowy weather, although it is not yet clear by how much.", "The number is also subject to revision, and such revisions can be significant.", "Because of the month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too much into the most recent number but, instead, look at averages over several months, and here the news remains positive.", "Firms added an average of 182,000 jobs per month last year, comparable to the pace in 2012.", "This consistent pace of job growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in December.", "This means that the unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points last year, and, importantly, it is at a lower level than the FOMC anticipated it would be at this point when we started the current asset purchase program in September 2012.", "That is, the labor market has performed noticeably better than expected, according to the unemployment rate measure.", "Some people, however, feel that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of progress being made in labor markets because it reflects declines in labor force participation as well as increases in employment.", "There is even concern that the unemployment rate will move back up significantly when discouraged workers reenter the labor force.", "Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned about this possibility.", "First, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates have been declining since 2000.", "The declines are driven mostly by demographic changes, including the aging of the baby boomers.", "This trend is ongoing and was expected to accelerate.", "Second, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey's micro data indicates that much of the decline in participation since the start of the recovery can be accounted for by increased retirements and disability.", "Some of these increases might have been driven by the state of the economy as some baby boomers perhaps moved their retirement decision forward after losing a job.", "Nevertheless, few of these former individuals are likely to reenter the labor force.", "In addition, there has been an increase in the number of people out of the workforce who are going to school, which means there is less concern about skill depreciation for these people.", "So while I do expect some discouraged workers to reenter the labor force as the expansion picks up and while they search for a job there could be upward pressure on the unemployment rate, I would not overinterpret the decline in participation as a lack of progress made in labor market conditions or as a problem that must be corrected.", "There are fundamental changes in the structure of the labor market that are likely real and sustained.", "The progress in the labor market has led to growth in household income.", "In addition to income growth, household balance sheets have strengthened as well.", "Overall household wealth, in nominal terms, advanced 11 percent year over year through the third quarter.", "The improving housing market has been an important contributor to that growth, with owners' equity in real estate surging 29 percent in 2013 over 2012.", "House prices are rising; the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages and the number of mortgage delinquencies are down.", "I expect these improvements will help to support consumer spending going forward.", "Business balance sheets are also healthy.", "Industrial production was very encouraging in November, when it advanced 1.1 percent on gains in all major categories.", "That growth was the most rapid in 12 months and brought the overall index higher than its prerecession peak for the first time.", "The Philadelphia Fed's Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing, which is a reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends, has also been in positive territory for seven months, and our firms expect continued expansion in manufacturing activity over the next six months.", "This gives me some hope that business fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of the recovery, will pick up somewhat this year.", "Inflation has been running below the FOMC's long-run goal of 2 percent.", "The year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation, is the Fed's preferred measure.", "It has drifted downward over the past year to about 0.9 percent in November.", "Core PCE, a measure that removes food and energy prices that tend to be volatile, was a bit higher at 1.1 percent.", "I believe we must defend our 2-percent inflation target from below and above.", "However, I believe inflation is likely to firm up as some of the factors that have held it down, such as the cut in payments to Medicare providers and generally weak medical costs, are likely to abate over time.", "I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and consistent with our 2-percent target.", "So, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target over time.", "Indeed, given the large amount of monetary accommodation we have added and continue to add to the economy, I think that there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.", "I anticipate overall economic growth of around 3 percent this year, a pace that is slightly above trend.", "This is far from the robust growth that many would like to see; nevertheless, it does represent steady progress and an improving economy.", "My forecast is largely in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent projections had a central tendency of growth of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, and accelerating to 2.8 to 3.2 percent in I believe this growth will continue to lead to declines in the unemployment rate over the next year and should result in an unemployment rate of about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014.", "This makes me somewhat more optimistic than most of my FOMC colleagues, who reported a central tendency of 6.3 to 6.6 percent by the end of 2014.", "So, let me turn to some observations about monetary policy.", "Over the past five years, the Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions to support the economic recovery.", "The Fed has lowered its policy rate - the federal funds rate - to essentially zero, where it has been for more than five years.", "Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing.", "We are now in our third round of these purchases, or QE3.", "These purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet.", "The Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the public about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future.", "In its December statement, the FOMC indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the FOMC's 2-percent target.", "On asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the purchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability.", "The Fed has structured its latest round of asset purchases as a flow-based program, with the idea that policymakers could fine-tune the rate of purchases in response to the economy.", "The FOMC decided in December to reduce the purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month.", "Thus, we are still adding monetary accommodation but at a slightly slower pace.", "Asset purchases are not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on the FOMC's economic outlook.", "However, the FOMC did indicate in December that if economic conditions evolve as expected, with improved labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its goal, then the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings.", "Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in his December press conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and continued job gains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014.", "The December employment report has not changed my belief that the economy has already met the criteria of substantial improvement in labor market conditions.", "So my preference would be that we conclude the purchases sooner than this, but I am glad that we have taken the first step on the path to ending the program.", "Eventually, monetary policy will be normalized, but the way in which that is done will depend on what operating framework we plan to use in the normalized environment.", "I believe that the exit strategy principles laid out by the FOMC in June 2011 still apply.", "More specifically, we need to return to an operating framework in which a market interest rate is our policy instrument.", "We also should shrink the size of our balance sheet, which is now about $4 trillion, and return to an all-Treasuries portfolio as part of the normalization process.", "This sounds easy in principle, but I believe the size and composition of our balance sheet will make it challenging to execute smoothly.", "There are now more than $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system.", "These reserves are not inflationary until they are converted to money and flow out into the economy.", "But as market rates rise in an improving economy, banks will find it advantageous to begin to increase lending or acquire assets using their reserves.", "The challenge for the Fed is to control the flow of reserves so that we can successfully maintain our 2-percent inflation target.", "This may require raising interest rates more quickly than currently anticipated.", "We have the tools that would enable us to raise rates if we chose to do so.", "However, the Fed may be subject to political pressures or pushback from various interest-sensitive sectors that could result in a more measured response than required.", "One of the consequences would be higher inflation.", "History suggests that the Fed tends to be behind the curve when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, and in the current environment, that delay could prove to be more costly than when reserves are in limited supply.", "Thus, it's a matter of our will rather than our ability.", "In summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.", "We are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014.", "Prospects for labor markets will continue to improve gradually, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its decline to 6.2 percent by the end of 2014.", "I also believe that inflation expectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the next year.", "On monetary policy, the reduction in asset purchases from $85 billion a month to $75 billion a month is a step in the right direction.", "I believe the economy has met the criteria of significant improvement in labor market conditions for ending the program and that further increases in the balance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable benefits for recovery.", "Even after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly accommodative.", "The work of the Fed, however, is far from over.", "Monetary policy still faces considerable challenges as we seek to normalize policy.", "The task should be to return to a framework in which a market rate is our primary policy tool, to reduce the size of our balance sheet, and to restore our portfolio to all Treasuries.", "The challenge will be to do so in a way that ensures that inflation remains close to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the seeds of another financial crisis."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
