description of a phenomenon of nature.", "Through an appropriate framework of data collection and well-organised planning of a scientific inquiry in any field of life, it helps in presenting complex information in a suitable tabular, diagrammatic and graphic form for an easy and clear comprehension, and helps in drawing valid inference about the population parameters from the sample data.", "If a problem can be properly formulated and measurement data can be generated, whether it arises in physical, biological, social sciences or any other discipline, statistical tools can be designed to provide a scientific solution.", "Thus, it is widely recognized that the proper use of statistics is a key element of scientific enquiry.", "At this stage let me emphasize that quality and integrity of data is the most important element in the success and utility of statistics.", "Uses of statistics 11.", "Let me give some examples of its uses.", "It plays a critical role in agriculture in

understand what is meant by \"misusing statistics,\" it is important to describe the role of statistics in the scientific method and relate the concept of \"misuse\" to other ethical concepts, such as \"misconduct\" or \"incompetence\" or \"negligence.\"", "Some misuses of statistics can be considered misconduct, although most misuses should be viewed as negligence or deficits of competence.", "While on the ethical dimension, I shall elaborate further, I shall deal with the other dimensions of \"negligence\" and \"incompetence\" as part of information illiteracy slightly later.", "How

on statistical concepts and methods.", "Even in theory, much of science and engineering involves natural variability.", "Variability, whether great or small, must be carefully examined both for random error and for possible researcher bias or wishful thinking.", "Because society depends on sound statistical practice, all practitioners of statistics, whatever their training and occupation, have social obligations to perform their work in a professional, competent, and ethical manner.", "The results of statistical investigations are usually stated in numerical form and are, therefore, in the public mind, assigned a degree of definiteness usually associated with mathematical technique.", "The careful investigator, however, is constantly aware of the fact that the preciseness of his numerical result varies directly with the degree of care used in selecting, from the larger universe, the sample upon which his study is based.", "The numerical conclusions derived from a study of the sample are held to be characteristic and representative of the universe.", "A very common error in statistical investigation is the selection of a sample which is not an accurate cross-section of the larger universe but merely a particular, unique segment.", "Conclusions drawn from the biased sample will not, of course, accurately reflect the larger universe.", "The misuse occurs when such conclusions are held to be representative of the universe by those who either deliberately or un-consciously overlook the sampling bias.", "An article about cats appeared in The New York Times' on August 22, 1989.", "It stated, \"The experts have also developed startling evidence of the cat's renowned ability to survive, this time in the particular setting of New York City, where cats are prone at this time of year to fall from open windows in tall buildings.", "Researchers call the phenomenon feline high-rise syndrome.\"", "Statistics were like this: from June 4 through November 4, 1984, 132 such victims were admitted to the Animal Medical Centre and most of the cats landed on concrete and most survived.", "From the data on the distance of the fall for 129 of the 132 cats, it was observed that the falls ranged from 2 to 32 stories.", "Only one of 22 cats that plunged from above 7 stories died, and there was only one fracture among the 13 that fell more than 9 stories.", "But how a cat will survive of a fall from a great height defying gravitation?", "Such description generally does not push one to scrutinize the statements till it was understood that majority of the cat owners do not report these incidents to any medical centre and believe that other people probably don't report their cats' deaths, either.", "Therefore, the error seemed so obvious that sample was not representative and there was data reporting problems.", "Let me cite another example on the wrong notion of conditional probabilities, which appear in Statistical Science 2005, a type of intentional and unintentional misinterpretation of statistical information.", "It says when discussing fatalities on highways on page 78: \"Four times more fatalities occur on the highways at 7 p.m. than at 7 a.m.\" This of course does not imply, as some newspaper had suggested, that it is more dangerous to drive in the evening than in the morning.", "Recast in the language of conditional probabilities, that P(accident | 7 p.m.) should not be confused with P(7 p.m. | accident).", "One more example, a study of the deaths arising out of road accidents revealed that 98 percent deaths occurs while driving on the left side of the road, whereas, only 2 percent death occurs in case of people travelling in the middle of the road.", "Hence, it was wrongly inferred that it was safer to travel in the middle than on the side of the road.", "Another area of concern has been the misuse of statistics coming from spurious correlation and attributing such relation to type of cause and effect phenomenon.", "In most cases a common variable, most importantly \"time\" works as a link.", "Let us take another example.", "Number of people watching TV serials and number of buffaloes will register a high correlation.", "If one tries to link them and finds a causal relationship is simply absurd.", "It is easy to get carried way.", "One of the prime misuses of statistics is finding a strong relationship between two variables when actually such correlation is spurious.", "However, exploration of such behaviour has also led to path breaking developments in econometrics.", "For example, most of the macroeconomic series have strong time trend and thus have strong correlation.", "Prima facie one may suspect the existence of spurious correlation.", "However, further exploration in such relationships led the foundation of the concept of cointegration.", "If two variables have a common trend, then there could be a possibility of a long-run equilibrium relationship between them.", "This statistical finding opened up a new dimension of modern economics and CWJ Granger was awarded Nobel prize in economics for this in 2003. .", "Let me now give you an example from the banking world.", "The concept of inflation is often misunderstood by people.", "You would often hear this refrain from many persons that despite RBI claiming that inflation has come down in the recent past, the prices have not come down.", "So, what is the truth?", "Well, the truth is simply that inflation is indicated as a percent change, so even when this percent is declining, all it means is that the prices are rising at a slower rate, but they are still rising!", "The prices would come down only when the inflation becomes negative.", "In conclusion, we must ask ourselves as to why a quotation like \"Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics\" as mentioned by me earlier is made about the subject of statistics.", "In my opinion, it is because the society is illiterate, i.e.", "it is information illiterate.", "Information literacy, which most people misunderstand, is the third generation of literacy.", "The first generation of literacy is when you know how to read and write.", "The second generation of literacy is when you are computer literate, but it is not enough to be just first or second generation literate.", "When transiting to a knowledge society, it is critical for all of us to be information literate or be third generation literate.", "And, one of the purposes of statistics is to bring about information literacy in the society.", "If that does not happen then statistics can be used to prove or disprove anything and it is the subject of statistics which would bear the burden of ridicule.", "So, it is up to all of us, faculty, students and practitioners alike, to redirect our efforts towards spreading information literacy in the society.", "Institutions associated with teaching and training of statistics have a more important role to play in that direction, and I am confident that students, teachers and practitioners of statistics associated with Department of Mathematical Sciences at BHU will take greater responsibility in spreading information literacy in the society.", "And this will be your greatest service to the memory of \"Mahamana\" and to the discipline of Statistics.", "I wish you good luck in this effort."], "classifications": ["none",
