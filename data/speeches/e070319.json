forum takes the theme of \"A harmonious society - the social responsibility of China's financial sector\", which is of great significance, because this theme not only reflects the characteristics of

financial sector can play and what social responsibilities it should take as the core in the modern economy.", "It is fair to say that each of us as financial practitioners, especially those in leading positions, must take this issue seriously.", "Not long ago, I published an article entitled \"Push forward the construction of a harmonious socialist society through developing a financial system for the disadvantaged\".", "Today, I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about the background against which this concept is put forward, the definition of the financial system for the disadvantaged, and its key aspects.", "Background of the concept As is known to all, in a modern society, finance and the economy are interdependent.", "Since China's reform and opening-up, the economy has been growing at a stable and fast pace.", "While our overall national strength keeps improving, some deep-rooted problems have emerged and accumulated, leading to structural imbalances in

imbalances\" is an emerging and growing group of disadvantaged regions, sectors and people.", "The support and involvement of the financial system is one of the important factors defining the development of this disadvantaged group.", "The financial sector has made great endeavors and undertaken some pilot programs in this area, in particular in supporting the development of the central and western China, the development of agriculture, rural areas and farmers, reemployment of laid-off workers, poverty reduction initiatives and student loans.", "We've put forward theories, carried out trials, and gained experiences, both positive and negative.", "But in general, the theories, practice and experiences are driven by isolated events instead of a systematic plan.", "There is no theoretical conclusion made from the strategic perspective of constructing a harmonious socialist society, and no practice under the guidance thereof.", "Because of the absence of a systematic financial theory, institutional and policy system to guide and push ahead the construction of a harmonious society, it is difficult to display the synergy of the entire financial sector in this

requirement for the financial sector to support the harmonious economic development, but also a responsibility.", "As such, I believe it necessary to put forward the concept of \"developing the financial system for the disadvantaged\" to fully display the functions of the financial sector in the construction of a harmonious socialist society.", "Definition of the concept \"Finance for the disadvantaged\" refers to the financing activities for the underdeveloped areas and groups.", "So far in China, it is meant to be the support rendered to the disadvantaged sectors with agriculture as the primary one, less-developed regions mainly in central and western China, and disadvantaged groups of farmers and laid-off workers in urban areas.", "It is fair to say that finance for the disadvantaged represents a revision to traditional finance that seeks immediate return.", "Generally speaking, in countries with immature financial systems, the opportunities are only available to a small group of the population with certain capital accumulation, while those short of capital accumulation are deprived of development opportunities, and subsequently of the benefits from economic growth.", "However, for a mature financial system with various financial institutions and appropriate institutional arrangement, it is possible to give financial support to those people or regions lack of capital accumulation but equipped with productive skills or resources in one way or another, so that they have opportunities to grow and develop.", "Therefore, while conforming to the principle of efficiency in the market economy, finance allocates resources to backward regions and industrial sectors, and helps improve the welfare of disadvantaged groups, make them benefit from
