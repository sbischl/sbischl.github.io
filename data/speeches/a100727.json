access to sources of financing.", "In the first place, resources must be procured by capital writedowns, the sale of assets and the reduction of exposures to unsecured creditors.", "This can be

is not full, if supervisors' powers are limited.", "Countries will submit to peer reviews of their supervisory standards, coordinated by the FSB.", "The impact of the new Basel rules on Italian banks The Bank of Italy's selective standards for admitting hybrid instruments in the calculation of regulatory capital have been reflected in the comparatively high quality of Italian banks' capital, which should facilitate their adaptation to the new, stricter Basel standards.", "The instruments already issued based on the current rules will nonetheless continue to be eligible for a sufficiently long period.", "The level of attention paid to the quality of capital must be raised further.", "We have already invited banks to refrain from issuing instruments that will no longer be recognized under the new standards.", "Since the Italian banking system remains anchored to the core business of traditional lending, the tougher capital requirements for trading and the introduction of financial leverage caps will have a lesser impact than in other countries.", "The various proposals to deduct deferred tax assets from regulatory capital are likely to have greater effects.", "Their value is high in Italy owing to uncommonly severe constraints on the tax deductibility of loan loss provisions.", "If it is deemed appropriate in order to avoid the further penalization of Italian banks,

demonstrated that rules on liquidity are also indispensable.", "We have already urged banks to prepare for the new standards.", "European supervision The reform of the European supervisory architecture envisages: a new macroprudential supervisory body, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), entrusted with the prompt identification of vulnerabilities and risks to financial stability and with recommending policies for containing them, and three sectoral supervisory authorities assigned to apply the rules and institute common supervisory practices.", "Beyond the rules, uniform and incisive controls are also essential.", "When one national supervisory authority adopts a lax approach, a dangerous breach is opened, through which potential vulnerabilities may be quickly propagated

supranational authorities to be endowed with the requisite powers of coordination.", "A leading role within the ESRB must be secured for the ECB and the national central banks: this would boost the Board's technical capabilities, fully exploiting the synergies between monetary policy and macro-prudential policy.", "Stress testing of banks' balance sheets In the spring of last year, the stress tests at the major US banks revealed, under the responsibility of the prudential authorities that had conducted them, the scale of the risks of individual banks, above all those in connection with the \"toxic\" assets on their balance sheets.", "This transparency drive was amply repaid by the markets: these banks, several of which had been assisted initially by public money, succeeded in raising over $200 billion in private capital, an unthinkable figure prior to the publication of the test results.", "Stock exchange assessments and fund-raising also benefited from the release of the results.", "Now Europe, albeit in less severe market conditions, has decided to proceed down the same road and will confront the US exercise.", "But the European tests examine more risk factors than those contemplated in the American case.", "In addition to adverse macroeconomic conditions, they also assume an increase in the market's perception of sovereign risk.", "The stress test hypothesizes: GDP growth three percentage points lower than that currently estimated by the European Commission for the two years 2010-11; and a larger rise in medium- and long-term interest rates than that recorded during the Greek crisis in the early days of May of this year.", "Compared with the US exercise, which involved 19 banks and three supervisory authorities, the European stress testing is much more complex, involving 91 banks in 20 countries.", "It is being carried out by national supervisory authorities in accordance with common guidelines and coordinated by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors with the participation of the ECB.", "The effort made by the authorities and the banks themselves has been exceptional.", "We hope that communications will be marked by a high degree of transparency.", "The results of the tests will be published on 23 July.", "By that date European governments will need to be ready to adopt appropriate measures if the results point to capital weaknesses and market solutions are not available.", "The Italian banks The tests on the Italian banks participating will inevitably produce a range of different results, but I am confident they will show individual banks' capital to be adequate.", "In the first quarter of this year the ratio of new bad debts to total bank lending remained stable at 2 per cent, a high value by comparison with the last ten years.", "We expect the flow of new bad debts to remain substantial in the coming months.", "The conditions of the markets and the economy continue to impinge on banks' profitability.", "The low interest rates compress the margins on traditional banking business.", "In the first quarter the operating profit of the five largest Italian banking groups was the same as in the first quarter of 2009.", "Loan losses absorbed more than half of this aggregate.", "In this newly delicate phase on the markets Italian banks' ability to raise funds has not diminished.", "Their one-month liquidity position continues to be more than satisfactory, thanks among other things to their ample endowment of assets eligible for refinancing operations with the ECB.", "Bank credit is showing signs of recovery.", "In the three months ending in May, lending to firms grew by an annualized 2.1 per cent on the three preceding months and that to households by 5.0 per cent.", "Firms' demand for credit is on the rise.", "Customer protection To protect retail customers, who represent the strength of the Italian banking system, is an objective the Bank of Italy is pursuing with great determination.", "In the last few years we have issued radically new rules in this field, laid the foundations for banks to supply simpler and cheaper products that make it easier for weaker consumer to access financial services, and prepared guidance that helps even the least expert customers to make choices consistent with their needs.", "Where - as in loans and overdrafts - the risk of opacity is greatest, we have introduced additional defences, carried out investigations and put forward proposals to improve the law.", "The Banking and Financial Arbiter (ABF), for which the Bank of Italy provides the resources for its operation, has ruled in favour of the customer in 60 per cent of the cases it has examined.", "The customers who incurred losses have been indemnified.", "The ABF's rulings strengthen the protection of customers not only in individual cases but also more generally because they guide banks towards correct behaviour.", "The checks made at banks' branches, head offices and websites assess not only formal compliance with the new provisions on transparency but above all the degree to which customer relations are correct in substance.", "The checks on non-bank intermediaries and their distribution channels are more severe today, and the requirements for entry in the register referred to in the Consolidated Law on Banking are stricter.", "We have intervened in the situations where the anomalies were most notable: loans secured by pledge of salary, revolving credit cards, the issue of guarantees, foreign exchange dealing and money transfers abroad.", "We have stepped up cooperation with the Finance Police, especially in the sectors most involved in criminal investigations.", "Additional safeguards for consumer protection are now being discussed.", "We have worked with the Government on the transposition of the European directive on consumer credit.", "The intention, properly, was to take this opportunity to carry out a broader reform, one that would also tackle the regulation of non-bank intermediaries and their channels of distribution.", "The reform bill is now before Parliament: it is essential that the proposed self-regulatory bodies have the tools and the means to work to good effect; that only reliable intermediaries inhabit the market; and that the granting of credit be restricted to institutions subject to supervision, with extremely limited exceptions.", "The crisis has shown the importance of promoting the acquisition of adequate financial knowledge.", "In this area, too, the Bank of Italy has stepped up its activity.", "The experimental financial education programme for schools developed together with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research has continued during the past academic year; the considerable improvement in knowledge that has been observed encourages us to pursue and expand the programme.", "Measures to combat money laundering The infiltration of criminal elements into economic activities has become diffuse, partly as a result of the crisis.", "The banks are the cornerstone of the battle against this degeneration.", "They must have a thorough knowledge of each customer and assess the risk of their involvement in illicit dealings.", "The Bank of Italy has tightened the application of rules and controls further.", "The inspections performed at numerous bank branches - 120 in late 2009 and early 2010 - have brought to light widespread shortcomings in the scrutiny of clients, the training of personnel, and the procedure for reporting suspicious transactions.", "The role of the senior management of banks is crucial: combating money laundering must be made part of corporate culture, including suitable systems of incentives and compensation."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal
