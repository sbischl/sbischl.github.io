open to trade in goods and services, but also to investment, to people and to ideas.", "Global integration is not the solution to all our problems, but acting to restrict it or to insulate us from its

course, is not enough.", "Our capacity to adapt to change depends in part on the effectiveness of government policy in a range of important areas.", "Education seems the most obvious of these, but policy in health care, in public infrastructure, and many other areas will also play an increasingly important role in determining the relative strength of the U.S. economy in this more integrated world.", "The U.S. educational system combines the strengths of high completion rates for secondary education, a rich variety of post-secondary school educational options, and exceptionally strong

more than two times the level in Japan.", "In a world in which economic performance depends increasingly on flexibility and adaptability to change, we probably need to move to a system in which a

important role in how well markets function.", "The test of policy is not just in the incentives we create for competition and innovation, but also in the clarity and stability offered by the regulatory framework and in the quality of public goods that governments deliver.", "Any one who travels outside the United States today returns with an appreciation about how rapidly public

"Financial markets outside the United States are now deeper and more liquid than they used to be, making it easier for companies to raise capital domestically at reasonable cost.", "These financial markets are at an earlier stage in the process of capital market development, and they will therefore experience rapid growth in securitization and the role of derivatives.", "These factors, more than other differences in tax, accounting, or legal regulatory regimes, account for the bulk of the declines' share of equity and debt raised in the United States by companies around the world.", "And this shift is something that we benefit from, not just in the direct sense that U.S. financial institutions play an important role in those markets, but in the broader sense that we will gain from the improvements in economic growth that come from financial market development around the world.", "But in this context, we need to be more attentive to the risk that specific aspects of our system, regulations or other constraints, create a greater disincentive to locate a financial business here, or to invest here, or to raise capital here, than would have been the case five or ten years ago.", "We need to take a careful look at how we regulate financial activity in a world where capital is more mobile, and the structure of the financial system has diverged substantially from the system for which our regulatory framework was designed.", "That does not mean we should contemplate weaker regulation or lower standards.", "The strength of the U.S. system is in part the result of the

brief points on the broader imperatives of macroeconomic policy.", "The United States faces very substantial gaps between our fiscal resources and our expenditure commitments.", "The size of these gaps, these deficits, have been masked in recent years by a substantial, unanticipated and probably transitory surge in revenues, and by an unusually long period of unusually low long-term interest rates, in part the consequence of foreign official capital flows.", "But these gaps remain substantial and the U.S. fiscal position is unsustainable.", "We are going to have to begin to develop a
