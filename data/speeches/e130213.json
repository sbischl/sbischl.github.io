for instance - in growing instabilities in real estate markets, and the necessary macro-prudential tools are only now becoming available.", "It is certainly very important to develop the new macro-prudential instruments and policies -

supervision links.", "Thanks to having access to signals from the central banking community of potential major liquidity problems in Icelandic banks, the Finnish Supervisor was able to act quickly in full cooperation with the Icelandic authorities and minimise the damage for depositors and the Finnish banking sector more broadly.", "Hence, information from the central bank was very useful for the supervisor to prepare timely actions.", "[Even though the banking sector remained stable, people were nevertheless nervous and -
