should it actually be introduced - ought to complement each other as well.", "Both are central bank money, just in different guises.", "According to a survey published in May by the Bank for International Settlements, to which a total of 81 central banks responded, nine out of ten are exploring central bank digital currency ( CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)).", "[1] More than one-quarter of the central banks surveyed are in the process of developing a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) or running pilot projects, and over 60% are conducting proofs-of-concept or experiments with CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) concepts.", "The Bundesbank, together with the other central banks in the Eurosystem, is also analysing the opportunities and risks that the possible introduction of a digital euro would entail.", "So let me start by talking today about \"why\" a digital euro might be useful.", "Afterwards, I will look at \"what\" it could deliver before finally discussing the future timetable - in other words, \"when\" a decision is expected to be made.", "Why do we need a digital euro?", "So \"why\" is the Eurosystem exploring the topic of the \"digital euro\"?", "The first reason is to do with strategic sovereignty in European payments.", "ECB (European Central Bank) President Christine Lagarde summed this objective up neatly, saying: \"In a more digital economy, we also need to ensure the strength and autonomy of European payment systems.\"", "[2] This is because European payment service providers have so far not developed any simple, SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)-wide solution for retail outlets, e-commerce or small, straightforward person-to-person payments.", "Instead, users often have to use international card systems and applications offered by bigtech firms.", "These firms leverage the reach of their platforms and often set their own rules and standards, making them able to restrict third-party use and access rights.", "This puts competition and efficiency in the world of payments at risk.", "For example, the European Commission has already noted that US (United States) technology company Apple was having an exclusionary effect on competition and restricting innovation by reserving access to NFC (Near Field Communication) [3] to contactless payments using Apple Pay.", "Germany was ahead of the field in this regard, having already adopted legislation on this issue at the national level back in 2019.", "However, to be a position to act not just after the fact but also pre-emptively, European legislators have now developed the Digital Markets Act.", "[4] Its aim is to clamp down on gatekeepers, enable more competition again and safeguard data protection and consumer protection.", "This has thus sent out an important signal internationally, too.", "The second reason why a digital euro might make sense is that people are paying less often with cash.", "This trend has also been observed in Germany for some time now, as confirmed by the Bundesbank's latest study on payment behaviour in July 2022.", "While 36% of amounts transacted at retail outlets are settled using coins and banknotes, in 2017 the share of daily expenditures accounted for by cash was still almost half.", "[5] In addition, there is a growing volume of sales in the e-commerce market, which is expanding to encompass more and more areas.", "The aforementioned payment behaviour study shows that online purchases as a percentage of recorded turnover quadrupled between 2017 and 2021.", "Shoppers now spend almost every fourth euro on the internet, an arena in which cash does not usually work.", "The digital euro would give the public access to secure central bank money, even in the digital age.", "This brings me to the third reason: a digital euro could support digital processes on a large scale.", "This would potentially make automated payments based on smart contracts an option in the future, and machine payments on the internet of things would also then be conceivable.", "In principle, private crypto tokens such as Bitcoin or Ether could also be used for this purpose.", "However, their strong fluctuations in value prevent them from being used as a payment instrument.", "Many private crypto tokens had a massive amount wiped off their value in recent months.", "While, at their peak in November 2021, their global market cap stood at almost \u20ac3 trillion, it was down to just one-third of this total latterly.", "[6] This is a powerful demonstration of the fact that crypto tokens are primarily a speculative investment instrument and not a means of payment.", "Could stablecoins, which are also based on distributed ledger technology, be an alternative?", "Their issuers promise to keep their value stable by pegging them to an official currency.", "Of course, whether or not they can actually deliver on this promise is something that needs to be carefully examined on a case-bycase basis.", "If it cannot be proved beyond doubt that they have the necessary reserves, they could certainly also be subject to exchange rate fluctuations.", "Indeed, the events surrounding the Terra stablecoin have clearly highlighted in recent months that tokens of this kind, too, can plummet in value and lead to substantial losses for investors.", "By contrast, a digital currency issued by the central bank could serve as a payment instrument, unit of account and store of value even in cyber space, thereby fulfilling all functions of money.", "This is because CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) would be as stable in value as other forms of central bank money, i.e.", "(that is) cash and commercial banks' balances with the central bank.", "Some countries, such as Nigeria and the Bahamas, have already brought CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) into circulation.", "In China, the e-yuan is undergoing wide-scale practical testing.", "We need to continue to keep an eye on these developments.", "For example, the e-yuan -
