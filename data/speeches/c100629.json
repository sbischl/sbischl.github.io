Tarullo, member of the FED Board of Governors finds the reasons in replacing the basic regulatory framework established after the Great Depression 1929-1933, which mostly limited the commercial banks to traditional lending activities, with the regulatory framework that in the 1970s started to install deep changes in the organization and regulation of the financial markets, culminating with the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill in 1999.", "He says that \"with the innovations, the traditional commercial banking business model was put under strong pressure on both sides: on the liability side in the balance sheet of the banks in the form of more attractive savings instruments, such as the funds for investing on the money market, and on the assets side, with the growth of public companies and international competition\".", "Until the end of the century the restriction cluster on the commercial banks from the great depression era was replaced with a regulatory setting in which they could operate on a national level, to involve in a much broader set of activities and to practically join with every kind of financial companies.", "Tarullo says, that is how the highly complex financial holding companies were started... the independent investment banks grew in a group of big, complex and highly indebted companies... the financial engineering was quickly changing the character of the entire financial services sector.", "Securitization and accompanying instruments united the capital markets and traditional lending activities, fueling the growth of the so-called shadow banking system.", "(3) Allan Greenspan in his latest paper \"The Crisis\" wrote about the reasons for it: a.", "\"it was the global proliferation of securitized, toxic U.S. subprime mortgages that was the immediate trigger of the current crisis\".", "But, he says: \"the roots of the crisis reach back, as best I can judge, to the aftermath of the Cold War\".", "Later he explains actually the large increase of the aggregate demand which came from, formerly the third world nations, especially China, which replicated the export-oriented model of the so-called Asian tigers, argumenting it with data that \"the savings rate of the developing world soared from 24% of nominal GDP in 1999 to 34% in 2007, far outstripping its investment rate\".", "b. that \"subprime mortgages in the United States for years had been a small appendage to the broader U.S. home mortgage market, comprising only 7% of total originations as recently as 2002\"...that \"most such loans were fixed-rate mortgages, and only a modest amount had been securitized...\" that \"..,.", "starting in late 2003, began to accelerate the pooling and packaging of subprime home mortgages into securities...\" that \"subprime mortgages securities outstanding in 2007 totaled more than 900 billion USD, a more than sixfold rise since the end of 2001\".", "c. that \"a classic euphoric global bubble took hold\", \"that by 2007, yield spreads in the overall debt markets h\u0430d narrowed to a point where there was little room for further under pricing of risk\".", "... \"that the bubble has reached such a size partly due to the fact that the dot-com bubble burst with very little footprint on global GDP\"...that as late as April, 2007 the IMF noted that \"global economic risks have declined, the overall U.S. economy is holding up well\"; that \"many quantitative firms whose number crunching sought to expose profitable market trading principles were successful so long as risk aversion moved incrementally (which it did much of the time)\";

countercyclical provisioning (China, India); (ii) loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (China, Hong Kong SAR, The Republic of Korea, (iii) direct controls on lending to specific sectors (The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore) oriented toward managing the aggregate risk throughout the business cycle (i.e.", "procyclicality);

(vii) loan to deposit requirements (China, The Republic of Korea), as a tool for managing the aggregate risk in every point in time (systemic oversight).", "These examples show that the macroprudential tools could have an effect on the vulnerabilities by increasing the financial sector resilience.", "The Basel Committee has already proposed the following tools: - countercyclical capital framework.", "This will require from the financial institutions to build up capital in good times, that can be drawn upon in periods of stress; - forward looking provisioning.", "Banks are encouraged to allocate provisions based on expected losses, as opposed to allocating provisions on the basis of incurred loss.", "This approach is less procyclical than the so-called \"incurred loss\" provisioning model.", "This measure includes activities aimed at restricting oversized payments of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation payments by financial institutions.", "Capital requirements are undoubtedly the foundations of the microprudential regulation, but they also have a macroprudent dimension related to the procyclicality of the financial sector.", "Capital buffers which should confront procyclicality should meet two objectives: first, they should help the banking system handle the risks which could materialize in periods of crisis, and second, they should mitigate the reduction of the economic activity in a situation of downward movement of the economy.", "Nevertheless, several key issues remain open for discussion.", "Should the discretionary interventions on the buffers be reduced to the minimum, in order to prevent regulatory capture?", "On which geographical level should the aggregation be adopted in order to calibrate the buffers?", "\"For example (Giovanni Carosio, June, 2010) says, in the euro area should it be linked to area-wide variables (credit growth), to address level playing field concerns, or should we leave the door open to disaggregated measures, as I will argue below?", "And would market pressures allow banks to run down the buffer in a downturn?\"", "As for the systemic risk which arises from the liquidity dry-ups, Carosio writes that no uncontroversial solution has been found yet.", "The Basel Committee proposed new standards (for example, The liquidity coverage ratio and Net stable funding ratio).", "It seems, Carosio says, that they are powerful instruments, but are still very micro-prudential in nature and do not necessarily address the \"fallacy of composition\" that is typically of liquidity...In principle (he continues) the systemic dimension of liquidity risk could be addressed by designing a countercyclical liquidity buffer, similar to the capital buffer ..., possibly without raising overall liquidity requirements.", "An important advantage of this option would be to eliminate the procyclicality of the micro-prudential liquidity regulation in its current formulation; a disadvantage would be an added layer of complexity.\"", "(Tobias Adrian and Markus Brunnermeier) According to Carosio, another solution would be the one proposed by Perotti, Enrico and Javier Suarez (2009) \"to levy charges on banks funding maturity, a proxy for systemic liquidity risk\" and the one proposed by Tobias Adrian and Markus Brunnermeier, \"to tie levies to measures of systemic risk\" or the one proposed by Nicoletti Alltimari, Sergio and Salleo (2010), \"to devise market instrument that make liquidity available on a contingent basis, when a systemic trigger is activated\".", "Undoubtedly, these issues require additional analysis and work.", "In the area of the microprudential regulation, the Basel Committee, as we all know, in December last year proposed an impressive collection of reforms aimed at increasing the resilience of the individual financial institutions in case of panic and stress.", "Without elaboration, I would only mention the following: First, increasing the quality and the quantity of the capital; Second, increasing the capital charges on the basis of the trading portfolio; Third, introducing of a leverage ratio for the financial institutions.", "Fourth, improvement of risk management and disclosures, as the crisis has revealed the weaknesses of the so-called \"improved\" risk management techniques on the basis of the internal risk models.", "Fifth, special attention should be paid to the so-called counter party credit risk from OTC derivatives.", "It became evident that these markets bear risks both for the individual financial institutions (microprudential) and for the financial system (macroprudential).", "Namely, OTC derivatives are traded bilaterally between banks, other financial institutions and corporations.", "They are not traded through the stock exchange, making difficulties in discovering where the last risk is located, i.e.", "who bears the last risk.", "Another set of tools should find a solution for the systemically important financial institutions, extremely complex question, extremely important for the systemic stability of the financial sector.", "Except for the general agreement about the need of adequate harmonization of the prudential regulation, as the systemically important financial institutions are almost all \"crossborder\" by their nature, so far no higher consensus on solutions regarding this matter has been reached.", "In the current discussion, basically there are two distinctive approaches, starting from three key features of the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs): their size, complexity and inter-linkedness.", "According to one of the approaches, no institution is too big, complicated or linked to fail.", "In this sense, there are proposals to limit the size of the banks and to separate commercial from investment banking, disintegrate conglomerates by living wills, etc.", "Some argue that \"this reasoning is controversial as the effectiveness of these measures depends on the specific features of a relatively small number of SIFIs; different countries will probably come up with different solutions\".", "(Carosio) Although it is possible, he says, to reach an agreement on some of these proposals, in particular on resolution mechanisms, others (e.g.", "breaking up institutions according to some criterion) would require a broad international political consensus, which seems unlikely at this stage.", "The second approach would be directed toward seeking additional capital requirement, or a tax, according to the measure for systemic relevance.", "Taxation seems, according to Carosio, more adequate in a burden-sharing perspective.", "\"The solution, in my judgment\", says Greenspan \"that has at least a reasonable chance of reversing the extraordinarily large 'moral hazard' that has arisen over the past year is to require banks and possibly all financial intermediaries to hold contingent capital bonds, that is, debt which is automatically converted to equity when equity capital falls below a certain threshold\".", "\"However, should contingent capital bonds prove insufficient, we should allow large institutions to fail, and if assessed by regulators as too interconnected to liquidate quickly, be taken into a special bankruptcy facility\".", "So, he supports the second approach, and in that light is the latest legislation in the USA which is about to be adopted, as well as the proposals in Europe which envisage measures of this kind.", "Namely, \"Restoring American Financial Stability Act\", which was passed in the US Senate on May 20, would impose significant new obligations and restrictions for the SIFIs, envisaging a possibility for the FED to introduce rising strict rules for capital, leverage and liquidity.", "On the other hand, on May 26, the European Commission proposed the Member States to establish national funds, financed from taxes imposed on the financial sector, in order to assist in closing or reorganizing the unsuccessful banks.", "The macroprudent tools mentioned so far, do not by any means exhaust the list of suggestions.", "Exploring adequate instruments continues, and we are all waiting to see what will be delivered both in the form of ideas and in the form of operational tools.", "The crisis has proved that the price stability is not sufficient to achieve financial stability.", "Basically, with small exceptions that have no impact on the adoption of political decisions, the dangerous influence of the growing imbalances in the financial system was not conceived.", "The central banks were happy for registering low inflation rates, so it seemed to sidetrack the rapid credit growth; the lower risk aversion; the increase in asset prices, and consequently, the mounting vulnerability on the financial market.", "That is why, O. Blanchard and others, (2010) say that: \"the crisis has made clear that policymakers have to watch many targets, including the composition of output, the behavior of asset prices, and the leverage of different agents.", "It has also made clear that they have potentially many more instruments at their disposal than they used before the crisis.", "The challenge is to learn how to use these instruments in the best way.\"", "Recently, Petra M. Geraats (M\u0430y 2010), concluded in the same direction: \"Recent financial crises have revealed that a 'nice' (non-inflationary, continuously expanding) economy can mask the build up of toxic imbalances that threaten the financial system.", "So it is vital for policymakers to proactively pursue not only price but also financial stability.", "Although the pursuit of both objectives could give rise to uncomfortable trade-offs, these can be bypassed by supplementing the main instrument of monetary policy, with tools for prudential policy, in line with the Tinbergen rule.\"", "Accordingly, asking whether the central banks should have double mandate and answering affirmatively, she (Petra M. Geraats) says: \"Although the twin goals sometimes give rise to dueling demands, with an appropriate policy framework central banks can accomplish both and achieve a dual mandate of price and financial stability\".", "Definitely, the consensus for this point of view is mounting, since larger number of authors are basically on the same line.", "\u0422his highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen the macro-prudential supervision role of central banks (de Larosiere, 2009).", "Macro-prudential policies could aim to contain the build up of financial imbalances and ensure that the financial system is sufficiently resistant to withstand a disorderly unwinding (Papademos, 2009).", "Considering the important informational synergies between micro-prudential supervision and systemic risk analysis, bringing micro-supervision under the same roof as other central bank functions seems an attractive proposition.", "Central banks can benefit from, and rely on, extended access to supervisory information and intelligence, especially on systemically relevant intermediaries, in order to better assess risks and vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole (A. Orphanides, May 2010).", "It is not necessary to say, because it is obvious, that I share the same opinion.", "The crisis also showed that there is no financial stability by pursuing profligate fiscal policy.", "The latest developments in Europe whetted this issue.", "The decisions of the governments, as one of the basic economic actors, have enormous influence on the aggregate demand.", "Therefore, the fiscal policy has key role as a shock absorber, contributing to the maintenance of the financial stability.", "However, we witness that many governments are ignorant to that.", "Why it is so, is not hard to guess, but watching this \"sobering\" in Europe, it is obvious that the crisis helped to firm up the following perspectives: 1) The fiscal policy should be countercyclical.", "It should have cyclically adjusted balanced budget rules adopted; 2) The fiscal policy must not be a source of shocks.", "If looking over the fiscal deficits in certain countries, it can be perceived that, there, it is far from that; That is why the old ideas for the need of establishing independent fiscal agencies and minimal framework which will guarantee independence to the statistical agencies competent for the national accounts, resurrected.", "It is impressive what Germany commenced.", "To incorporate fiscal stability through the highest act in the country, the constitution.", "V. As usual, the establishment of a new action framework is one thing, while whether this framework will become operational, functional, and to what extent, is another thing.", "It is obvious that the bunch of new ideas, new tools we talk about forced by the crisis, are focused on establishing a concept for managing systemic risk.", "Therefore, the questions whether it will function, on what the result depends most, are logical. )", "First, the systemic risk is not too hard to define.", "It is harder to provide operative contents, because of its different dimensions: procyclicality;
