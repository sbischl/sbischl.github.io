a detailed review of the CMU, but I would like to mention two issues that I consider critical from the perspective of a 'global euro'.", "The first problem is the lack of a European safe asset.", "Medium-term trends show that access to market-based finance for companies has deteriorated, the amount of loans transformed into market instruments such as securitization has fallen significantly,

the list goes on.", "A scarce supply of safe euro-denominated assets is perhaps the single most important constraint on the CMU, and hence on the global reach of the euro.\"", "The issuance of the Next Generation EU bonds is a first and welcome step in this direction, but a one-off programme is not a game changer: to stimulate the development of the CMU and strengthen the IRE, we would need a steady, predictable supply of 'safe assets'.", "The second problem is that we do not have a fully-fledged banking union (yet).", "The creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism after the financial crisis was a quantum leap in this respect, but it was not sufficient to create a single banking market.", "The European banking sector remains largely segmented along national lines: in 2021, banks held domestic assets worth more than four times the value of their non-domestic euro-area assets.", "*' This poses a problem for the creation of a genuine CMU, as banks play a central role in all the major financial centres.", "They operate - and often lead - in key segments such as asset management, bond underwriting and initial public offerings, they provide financial advice and they trade actively in securities markets, often providing critical market-making services.", "It is therefore difficult to imagine a genuine CMU without banks that are able to operate smoothly throughout the euro area.", "Improving in these dimensions is as important as ever.", "In the coming years, Europe may have to navigate a more challenging global political environment than in the past.", "It will also have to deliver on its ambitions in areas such as defence and the green and digital transitions.", "As I have argued elsewhere, a fully functioning CMU would greatly
