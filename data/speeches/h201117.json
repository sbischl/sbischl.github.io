our strategic priorities for the next three years to become stronger kaitiaki, enabling us to assist the longer-term wellbeing of New Zealanders for years to come and to meet our vision of being a

how we operate is providing a foundational opportunity to transform the Bank.", "Reviewing and modernising the current 30-year old legislation is a crucial part of ensuring that the Bank remains fit for purpose.", "We have been working with the Treasury since June 2018 on Phase 2 of the Review of the which sets out the Bank's future institutional Reserve Bank Act.", "A new Act, and governance arrangements, was introduced to Parliament on 28 July 2020 and we expect it to receive Royal Assent in 2021 and become effective from 1 July 2022.", "Once enacted, some of the key provisions of the Act include: Establishing a Governance Board similar to the independent crown entity model, responsible for the oversight and governance of all the functions of the Bank, except those undertaken by

which I am pleased to share with you this morning.", "In order to facilitate economic growth, the public need to be confident that deposit takers (i.e.", "banks and non-bank deposit takers) and

legislative changes which will strengthen the Bank's prudential regulation and supervisory powers.", "Firstly, the Deposit Takers Act.", "This Act is expected to modernise, strengthen and unify our regulatory framework for all deposit-takers both banks and non-bank deposit-takers, including the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme, updated crisis management tools, and strengthening our

for registered banks is a crucial tool for maintaining financial stability.", "In December 2019 we announced the final decisions following a comprehensive review.", "The decisions include increasing regulatory capital buffers relative to current prudential settings.", "Strong capital buffers reduce the likelihood of bank failures by increasing the capacity of banks to absorb losses, essentially making our banking system safer for all New Zealanders.", "In response to COVID-19, we decided to delay the implementation of the new capital framework for at least 12 months to ensure banks could support their customers with provision of credit to households and businesses.", "Banks already have strong buffers of above current regulatory minimums as capital levels have increased steadily over the past ten years.", "We have encouraged banks to use these buffers to support their customers and economic recovery.", "There is still a high degree of uncertainty around the economic outlook and it is possible that bank resilience will be tested in the coming months as loan losses rise materially from current low levels.", "We will continue to monitor these developments closely.", "We expect to

oversee FMIs, set legally binding standards, including information collection and crisis management powers.", "This will enable us to better ensure payment and settlement systems are strong, robust, and resilient.", "All these changes together will modernise and strengthen the regulatory regime, the firms we regulate and oversee and support a regulatory approach that is proportionate to financial stability risks.", "We recognise that introducing new legislation might come with a degree of uncertainty for the institutions that we regulate and that there might be concerns about increased compliance costs.", "We are committed to be a more active regulator one that will continue to engage with industry and relevant stakeholders in an open and constructive manner and to carry out cost benefit analysis to keep those costs to a minimum.", "In addition to these legislative changes, we are also looking at improving the cyber risk awareness and resilience of the financial sector in New Zealand.", "Earlier this week (October 20) we released a consultation paper on risk management guidance for cyber resilience including our initial views on the role of information gathering and sharing in building cyber resilience.", "We welcome your feedback on this important work.", "Supporting and developing culture A strong legislative framework can only go so far in instilling the right culture and behaviours in financial institutions, and the communities they serve.", "We are maintaining a careful watch with our fellow financial regulators on how our financial institutions are responding to customer needs in this recovery period.", "As I have mentioned earlier, for us, this has meant talking to banks about courage and customer outcomes, ensuring that risk appetites of our financial institutions are appropriately calibrated to today's challenges.", "We are pleased to see that banks are taking on board our recommendations from the Bank Conduct and Culture Review18 FMA in

intend to meet those.", "We welcome these guidelines and look forward to seeing the positive changes for New Zealanders.", "While we have been focused on enabling banks to prioritise relief and good customer outcomes, especially to those who have been financially impacted by the pandemic, we recognise that many of these challenges will exist for a number of years.", "That is why we are keeping an eye on members of our society who are more likely to be vulnerable and our objectives as New Zealand's central disadvantaged.", "Critical to our success in meeting bank is ensuring that we drive wider economic wellbeing for all New Zealanders.", "To achieve this, we are undertaking work which focuses on enabling social cohesion and financial inclusion.", "Social cohesion creating a framework which

global discussion on indigenous economics with other central banks and relevant organisations.", "Translating the key metrics of our Financial Strength Dashboard into Te Reo is also underway as part of our ongoing commitment to Te Reo and Tikanga Ma\u0304ori.", "We have created new financial kupu (words) for the Dashboard which will be added to the online Ma\u0304ori dictionary - Te Aka - later this year.", "By recognising all New Zealanders, we are harnessing diversity and inclusion, and collaborating to better understanding the economy so to best promote the economic wellbeing of all New Zealanders.", "Supporting the right culture requires us working more collectively and courageously with financial services and other regulators to continue to be active, relevant and a cornerstone of New Zealand's economy and society.", "We maintain an active dialogue with industry stakeholders on how best to do this.", "These discussions have been in co-ordination with our CoFR partners the FMA,
