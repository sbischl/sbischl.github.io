"By 2050, Asia and the Pacific will be home to 62% of the world's elderly population, with one in four persons aged 60 and above.", "This will lead to greater demand for health insurance, annuity and

growth - to become a global insurance marketplace at the heart of Asia.", "The journey to a regional underwriting hub In the early days, the Singapore insurance industry was focused on servicing domestic business, with life insurance being the mainstay.", "In fact, MAS had adopted a closed-door policy to direct insurers since 1990.", "In 2000, MAS liberalised the insurance industry, lifting the closed-door policy on direct insurers and the 49% foreign shareholding limit in locally owned direct insurers.", "Singapore's development as a regional insurance hub took off.", "Since 2000,

deeper understanding of Asian risks.", "For example, prior to the devastating floods of 2011, Thailand had not been viewed as catastrophe-prone.", "The scale of the floods and the knock-on effects of natural catastrophes on global supply chains came as a rude surprise.", "The floods damaged more than 7000 industrial and manufacturing plants in 40 separate provinces.", "This affected countries with significant manufacturing capabilities in Thailand, most notably Japan.", "The majority of the insurance losses therefore came not from property damage, but from business interruption claims arising from the disruption to manufacturing and supply chains.", "It is therefore important that insurers have senior experts in the region who understand Asia's multi-faceted and inter-connected risks.", "This will enable the industry to better price and underwrite regional risks, and achieve sustained growth.", "MAS will seek to increase the depth of expertise in Singapore by continuing to work with

offices in any ASEAN member country.", "The framework is expected to be discussed at the ASEAN Finance Ministers' Meeting next year.", "Second, increasing the pool of Asian risk data.", "Modelling and loss simulation are key tools to help insurers manage and price their exposures.", "Accurate and timely data are critical for risk models to predict the impact of a loss event.", "For example, to predict the vulnerability of an insured risk to catastrophes, a wide variety of data is required, such as geographic location, soil structures, rainfall, construction materials and urban density, just to name a few.", "However, there is a severe paucity of data on Asian risks.", "Singapore is addressing this gap by setting up several research institutions to gather and analyse data in specific areas of risks.", "For example, the Institute of Catastrophe Risk Management (ICRM) at the Nanyang Technological University is currently undertaking research projects for flood and earthquake risk assessment in selected Asian cities.", "\u2022 In addition to collecting and analysing the data, ICRM conducts on-site studies and risk assessments of the cities in question, and develops hazard maps

play host to over 70 insurance brokers.", "Four of the top five brokers in the world have their regional hubs in Singapore.", "Today, brokers are not just intermediaries, but also high-value service providers who drive innovation and collaboration in the industry.", "Many brokers provide a wide range of risk management services.", "These include dynamic financial analysis, risk management and actuarial consultancy, portfolio and financial modelling, and catastrophe modelling.", "Some brokers have also begun to tap alternative risk transfer solutions to manage more complex and larger risk exposures and liabilities.", "We are keen to encourage brokers to use Singapore not just as a placement centre, but also as a centre of excellence for innovation.", "A good example of this is Aon, which recently established its Analytics and Innovation Center in Singapore to provide analytics solutions to the Group's business units on a global basis.", "Second, encouraging a subscription market.", "To underwrite large and complex risks, insurers need to collaborate.", "Risk sharing enables market participants to diversify their portfolios.", "We want to promote a true subscription market, where insurers not only share risks, but also expertise.", "The subscription concept leverages both the deep expertise of the lead insurer and the supporting capacity of the other insurers to cover a variety of large and complex risks.", "Such deep collaboration requires contract certainty.", "Contract certainty ensures the finalisation of terms and conditions of the policy prior to inception of risk and therefore, serves to minimise ambiguity and disputes over claim and coverage.", "I am pleased that our industry players have come together to form a workgroup, which issued earlier this year a set of guidelines and best practices for reinsurance contract certainty.", "The workgroup is now monitoring the industry's progress in achieving contract certainty via monthly submissions by industry players on the level of contract certainty in their reinsurance transactions.", "\u2022 This is a sterling example of industry collaboration.", "MAS supports this initiative and has been working with the industry to implement the new standards.", "Third, creating more platforms to bring buyers and sellers together.", "This conference is a good example.", "The Singapore International Reinsurance Conference has become Asia's version of the Baden-Baden Meeting and the Monte-Carlo Rendezvous.", "It is a key platform for insurance players not just to share knowledge, but also to negotiate renewals and explore opportunities for collaboration.", "Foster a conducive business environment Finally, I will touch on our efforts to foster a conducive business environment for insurance.", "There are two critical success factors.", "The insurance industry already has in place some good talent development programmes at the undergraduate and fresh graduate levels.", "Take for instance, the Global Internship Programme (GIP) offered by the General Insurance Association.", "This is a structured internship programme which gives selected undergraduates exposure in general insurance companies both locally and overseas.", "MAS, in partnership with the industry, has recently developed an Insurance Talent Development Framework, which maps out training and career progression pathways for both new entrants and existing insurance professionals.", "New industry-wide programmes will be launched in 2014 across a spectrum of roles and seniority levels.", "At the entry level, we will have two programmes.", "The Insurance Executive Assistant Programme (IEAP) will prepare diploma holders for junior entry-level positions.", "It will complement the GIP, which is targeted at university graduates.", "The Insurance Management Associate Programme (IMAP) will place and train top-tier fresh graduates through a structured apprenticeship programme.", "For existing industry professionals, there will also be two new programmes.", "The Insurance Specialist Programme will deepen participants' specialist and technical knowledge in key functions such as underwriting and claims, as well as in specialist lines such as trade credit, political risks, aviation and marine risks.", "The Hi-Po Leader Programme will provide those with leadership potential with a series of programmes to prepare them for senior management roles in the insurance industry.", "The second critical success factor is Regulation.", "Strong prudential and regulatory standards have always been a source of Singapore's competitive advantage as a financial centre.", "Through promoting sound risk management and a safe environment, regulation fosters confidence in the industry and helps attracts business.", "Singapore was one of the early movers to a risk-based supervisory and capital framework for insurance, in 2005.", "Since then, MAS has been actively refining the regulatory framework and approach.", "We are currently undertaking a comprehensive review to enhance the risk-based capital framework, taking into account evolving international standards and market developments.", "In particular, we are seeking to improve the comprehensiveness of the risk coverage and the risk sensitivity of the framework.", "The operating environment - be it for individuals or enterprises - is becoming more complex and uncertain.", "Managing risk has become an increasingly important part of our existence, and doing it well has become a key determinant of success.", "Insurance - at its core - is about managing risk.", "You are in an industry that serves a larger public purpose.", "You are also in an industry that has great promise.", "Asia offers tremendous opportunity for the insurance industry.", "As the leading insurance and reinsurance hub in Asia, Singapore is well-equipped to serve the growing needs of the region.", "But to become a global marketplace for insurance, we have to continually reinvent ourselves.", "The industry's support and partnership are critical to the achievement of this vision.", "Let us work together to build a truly global insurance marketplace in Singapore."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
