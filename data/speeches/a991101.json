transportation was slow.", "In the county of Va\u0308rmland, for example, there were sixty different sites for the production of iron in 1870.", "When the railways had been constructed, it was easier to concentrate production to fewer sites; by around 1900 there were only six sites and they were accordingly considerably more efficient.", "This is just an example to illustrate how the railways played a major part in Sweden's industrial upswing in the late 19th century.", "Productivity and growth rose.", "For the Internet, this phase of the process probably lies ahead.", "The new technology has not yet seriously altered either production and distribution processes or consumer behaviour.", "Progress is still a little hesitant as more and more people use the new technique for surfing and learn the new technology.", "The potential will also be limited as long as the technique is not entirely user-friendly.", "IT generates pressure for change When the new information technology really catches on, it will probably lead to a rapid expansion and transformation of capital stocks.", "The entire economy will then be involved in intensive investment and high productivity growth.", "Old technology will be replaced by new and each unit of capital equipment will then require a smaller input of labour.", "Unprofitable units or firms will be closed down, accompanied by new establishments.", "Structural changes generate developments that are often referred to at present as a \"new economy\".", "The marked improvement in productivity maintains profits and keeps prices down.", "During the transformation, a good circle is created but it is difficult to tell how long it will last.", "It can be described, if you like, as a period of extensive rationalisation and heightened efficiency.", "The growth trend is raised for an indefinite period, enabling the economy to expand more rapidly without inflation taking off.", "It should be born in mind that the adaptation to the new information technology does not occur automatically.", "It is not the case that one day we suddenly find the new technology has begun to be implemented in ways that are leaving their mark on economic developments in general.", "The late 19th century provides important lessons about the necessary conditions for this good circle.", "At the beginning of the 1800s Sweden was still a poor country with an unstable form of government, a chaotic monetary system and a general shortage of credit facilities.", "Ninety years later the Swedish economy had undergone a dramatic transformation.", "Inflation was low, with an orderly monetary system.", "The nation was bursting with vitality in every field.", "An impressive range of products, many of them world leaders, were being developed on the basis of Swedish inventions.", "Swedish financial experts were engaged in the exploitation of the inventions at an early stage.", "Employment was provided for more and more people, living standards rose and growth was among the highest in the world.", "Opinions about the causes of the pronounced change in the Swedish economy are not completely unanimous.", "The stable prices presumably played a part.", "When inflation is low or the price level is stable, those who have to plan for the longer run face less uncertainty.", "Another significant factor was probably the credit system's development in the 1800s.", "Banks were established and the abolition of interest controls was followed by more financial expertise.", "That made it possible to exploit the inventions and finance investments in the emerging industries.", "An increasingly stable form of government presumably contributed, too.", "A series of constitutional reforms provided a guarantee of stability.", "Economic activities benefited from the abolition of trade guilds, freedom to trade and the reform of joint-stock companies.", "The reform of elementary education was, of course, another important step that ultimately promoted human capital.", "This catalogue is not intended to be a complete account of all the factors behind Sweden's transformation from a poor country into a rapidly expanding industrial nation.", "The point I want to make is that a variety of institutional changes seem to have been needed to provide a stable framework for the subsequent process of industrialisation.", "It is just this stability in the fundamental conditions for economic activities that was no doubt important for the process that resulted in the industrial revolution, which in itself was full of commercial risks and uncertainties.", "Improvement in opportunities for change but ... A similar gloss can be applied to the realignment of economic policy from the second half of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.", "There have been a number of reforms aimed at creating stability and opportunities.", "The credit and currency markets have been deregulated, components of the social security system have been reformed, a tax reform has been implemented, targets have been established for government finances, price stability is enshrined in law and the Riksbank has been given an independent status.", "All this represents good possibilities of the Swedish economy facing a stable future as we step over the threshold to a new millennium.", "The question is, however, whether the new information technology will be implemented in the far-reaching ways that are necessary in order to reap the really large benefits.", "Let us look at another period in Sweden's economic history when things did not go quite as well.", "After World War II, when activity in the industrialised countries recovered and competition grew, partly because trade barriers were lowered, it became necessary to realign production in Sweden.", "The need for change resembled what we are beginning to discern on the horizon today.", "For much of this post-war period, however, wage costs rose at a rapid rate.", "Profitability in Swedish business was accordingly under pressure from two fronts: growing competition from the rest of the world and rising wage costs.", "Firms countered the pressure on profits by rationalising in an attempt to cut production costs rather than by investing in new products.", "The diminishing profits simply did not provide the stimulus that was needed for a prompt renewal of the capital stock in response to the pressure for change.", "A process of change involves shedding, but development is equally important.", "Most things still looked good to begin with.", "The 1960s was a fantastic decade for growth.", "But the strategy proved to be defensive and stagnation set in during the 1970s.", "Rationalisation has its limits as a means for growth.", "Without renewal, growth normally slows sooner or later.", "Measures are called for in periods of growth but it is easy to be deceived and lean back to enjoy the fruits.", "The long-term growth trend did indeed begin to turn downwards more markedly than in other countries.", "Economic policy responded with a series of devaluations in an attempt to maintain growth in the traditional industries.", "The latest devaluation was invariably described as the last, but the cycle of rising wage costs and a devaluation was repeated time and again.", "The endeavour to compensate for the lack of change in Sweden's corporate sector, which had its roots in the 1960s, simply did not work.", "If anything, the devaluations meant that the problems persisted and were accentuated.", "The lack of investments in new products and the dependence on a gradually outmoded structure of production helped to impose an adjustment of the entire nation's material standard.", "For many years growth in Sweden was weaker than in the world around us.", "This example shows how a \"new economy\" at that time resulted in problems for the Swedish economy rather than opportunities.", "The lack of change, because wage formation did not function properly, led to a weaker economy that was more inflation prone.", "The period clearly illustrates how globalisation, increased competition and new technology can result in lower growth and higher inflation if changes are not made in time.", "If the economy is under pressure from strong competition as well as poorly functioning wage formation, there is a risk of economic renewal lagging behind.", "Concluding remarks As I have said, the new information technology is making rapid progress.", "As far as we can see today, it will affect production and distribution processes as well as consumer behaviour.", "That in turn makes the environment more competitive and calls for changes in Sweden's corporate sector.", "Put to good use, this transformation can probably create stronger potential growth, lead to higher productivity growth and lower inflation, and favour employment.", "The favourable changes that have occurred over a number of years in the Swedish economy since the 1980s suggest that such a development is within our grasp.", "But as I just mentioned, if wage formation does not function properly, firms will be under pressure from two fronts.", "Profitability will be depressed both by increased competition and by rising wage costs.", "Investment will be held back and the transformation will proceed too slowly or not at all.", "There will then be no quick renewal of capital stocks.", "Firms will not make good use of the new information technology.", "I have cited wage formation as a conceivable factor that may hamper a transformation, but of course there are other factors as well, for example the tax system, the educational system, etc.", "It is not a function of the Riksbank to point out specific factors that can affect the pace of structural change.", "But perhaps we can contribute to a broader discussion of the new economy.", "Various factors that hamper or check an adjustment could thus result in the Swedish economy following a lower, not a higher, path for long-term growth, with a stronger, not a weaker, inflation propensity and a continuation of high unemployment instead of a reduction to the low level that most people want.", "These risks seldom feature in the general discussion about the new economy.", "The changes that many people refer to as the new economy unquestionably present a number of challenges to the Swedish economy in the present situation.", "My comments have indicated, moreover, that the notion of a new economy is not correct; that is not what it is all about.", "It is rather a matter of a new challenge in the long series of challenges the Swedish economy has had to face ever since the dawn of the industrial era more than a century ago."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
