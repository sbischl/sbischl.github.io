I understand they are going to test around 65 lakh candidates in 2011-12. .", "Professor Debashis Chatterjee, Director of IIM Kozhikode has an interesting take on the testing that we conduct for recruiting people.", "He says that these psychometric tools and classic tests are not useful because we can't distinguish between problem-solving on paper and problem-solving in the field.", "Talent, as he puts it, is transferable from one context to another but not from one person to another.", "While the Indian banking industry faces the daunting task of recruiting freshers in droves, I would earnestly request the organisers of this Seminar to have a serious introspection on the kind of talent that the Indian banking industry requires and spend some time in devising ways and means to spot the right kind of talent.", "Studies at Harvard have shown that there may be no correlation between academic performance and performance in the field.", "I am sure that all of us would prefer to get it right from the start by assessing exactly what we're after in terms of talent and ensuring we have what it takes to judge the candidates who want to join us.", "And, believe me, in the banking industry, we do need a variety of talent.", "Take someone whom some of us may call a congenital nagger.", "You might find, surprisingly, that he or she would do extremely well at tele-marketing or selling insurance.", "It's about one thing being negative in one context, yet positive in another.", "The stubbornness that Gandhiji displayed in class is also what helped him fight the British.", "But we seem to be lagging behind in this respect.", "For instance, despite all the emphasis on financial inclusion, I have not come across any study that indicates what kind of skills or talent the business correspondents should have though we are going to need may be more than 2,00,000 business correspondents and, they will be the lynchpins of the system that will make financial inclusion a success.", "I will be very happy if the IBPS does some work in this regard.", "The fight for talent 14.", "After we have identified the kind of talent that we are going to require, we are faced with a fight for talent.", "Before that, we have a fight for manpower itself.", "We are living in a knowledge age and our workforce will predominantly comprise of knowledge workers.", "From the time when people were just expected to know how to do work - to people who were expected to know what they are doing - we have now come to an age when to be a knowledge worker he or she must not only know how and what of the work but also why he/she is doing that.", "In a knowledge age and in a knowledge society, it is not only the banks that will need knowledge workers - every organisation will need knowledge workers and, therefore, there is a fight for talent.", "How do we get to acquiring people with the right kind of talent?", "Unfortunately, it is the same limited talent pool that will be targetted by Banks, FIs, Insurance and Telecom and other industries which are on fast growth track and in need of talented manpower.", "While my friends in the Banking industry are busy developing \"on-line\" application forms and \"on-line\" tests, we need to probably question if we are even targetting the right kind of talent pool.", "I would like to have a study on how many people in remote villages, at the taluka / tehsil level, appear for the recruitment tests that are conducted.", "Because these might be the people who could drive our financial inclusion agenda.", "Currently in the PSBs, talent acquisition at the base level is only a small part of the overall crunch.", "As per estimates, close to 1,00,000 employees of Public Sector Banks will be retiring by 2015.", "These are seasoned, experienced people of whom around 7% would be in Executive Grade.", "Replenishment at leadership positions is also a major requirement and in Public Sector Banks, we have EDs and CMDs even for one or two years.", "We need a larger pool of leaders to work as General Managers, Executive Directors and CMDs of Banks.", "Are there enough people within the PSB system with necessary talent and requisite experience to fill up these positions?", "Did we spot and nurture say, a pool of 200 or 500 people who would fill these positions?", "On the contrary, we keep hearing that experienced, senior people leave PSBs for greener pastures.", "While at lower levels, programmes can be developed for equipping the recruits with the right kind of skills, it would be challenging to get leaders.", "If there is freedom to leave the organisation at any level, and talented people do indeed leave, then the solution would be to acquire the talent back from the market place - go in for lateral induction/ recruitment at senior levels.", "If they do not do this, then obviously the PSBs or any such organisation will be at a distinct disadvantage.", "Banks may also have to consider direct induction at senior levels from unconventional talent pools.", "Spot the right talent and provide them with a challenging work environment that the PSBs can certainly provide.", "Another important aspect in the talent acquisition exercise would be to adapt to the new generation and strike a blend of fresh and experienced talent.", "Now, it would be difficult for us to get people who join us and stay their whole lives with us.", "This being the case, we will have to look at diverse range of arrangements for the work force that we need.", "There could be people working part time, people working as interns, people working on contract, etc.", "Talent management challenges 18.", "For HR practitioners, the times are going to be very challenging.", "The work force will get complex and there will be a need to juggle a wide variety of people with varied needs and preferences, resulting in an array of relationships between the organisation and those who work for it.", "I am an avowed fan of Peter Drucker, and he had more than a decade ago, expressed the need for what he called \"non-traditional\" work relations: flexible schedules, contract arrangements, and virtual teams etc.", "In the knowledge age, our entire management theories which are aimed at being more productive in the industrial society and the ethics around it will need to undergo a 360 degree change.", "When we talk of talent management today, it is about managing knowledge workers and there are some prerequisites for it: \uf0b7 They cannot be treated as subordinates, but associates \uf0b7 They cannot be managed, but led \uf0b7 They will work flextime and flexi place but would need a \"home base\" Above all, they cannot be purchased or bribed, they have to be empowered.", "Then, the challenging task of \"Talent Management\" will have to be handed over to a central HR function - away from the line managers.", "The human resources function, would serve as the \"home base\" for the organisation's workforce - attracting, tracking, developing and orchestrating this complex talent corps.", "Like staffing managers in professional service firms or talent agencies in the film industry, this new talent management function would help connect the right people with the next challenging job.", "Meanwhile, traditional line managers would evolve to roles more similar to programme managers or film directors - setting direction and running the team of employees who have been assigned to the task or department at that moment in time 21.", "As I mentioned earlier, there is a whole industry growing around \"Talent Management\" today - most of it technology driven.", "But how do we make sense of the choices available today?", "There is emergence of new social media-driven solutions, to acquisitions and additions of new functions by the big technology players, the landscape is constantly changing.", "These so called \"Talent Management Systems\" broadly have the following components: (b) On-boarding / Induction (c) Training and Development (d) Performance Management (e) Succession Planning (f) Employee Retention Initiatives and finally; (g) Employee Separation While I have no quarrels with the overall structure of the Talent Management process, I do not think that there can be a one-size-fits-all kind of an approach.", "There will certainly be some common core elements of strategy but it is important that an organisation's talent management strategy is tailored to suit its culture, values, goals, size and geographic spread.", "The core elements could be: \uf0b7 Consistent, documented and transparent talent assessment criteria, processes and definitions to identify top talent, high potentials and successors.", "\uf0b7 Career and development discussions to ensure managers know their direct reports' advancement and relocation desires.", "\uf0b7 Talent review meetings that are designed to increase talent visibility and to calibrate succession plan and high-potential selection decisions.", "\uf0b7 Follow-through of development action plans as identified in the talent review meetings to prepare successors and high potentials for career movement and advancement.", "Having listed the core elements of the talent management strategy, I want to add a new dimension.", "We often define high potential employees as ones who have the talent to move above the level of their current position.", "Say two levels above their current position.", "Why don't we slightly tweak this and include the candidate's capacity to move across, say, two or three other functional areas as well?", "A true high-potential employee should also be willing to take on the risk and challenge associated with career movement in new positions outside of his or her core area.", "Further, as Banks have a large geographic reach, high potentials should also be willing to relocate to other geographic or international regions to build their global knowledge and expertise.", "Now, should we be working on identifying top performers alone?", "All of us are keen to identify top performers, but how many of us want to identify the weak performers?", "In any system it would not be possible for us to have only top performers.", "There will be average performers and weak performers as well.", "Why do we need to identify weak performers?", "Not because they should be sent home - not that I have a problem if you want to send them home.", "They need to be identified and worked upon - it is they who can really make a big difference.", "For example, if a teacher works hard on a student scoring 95% marks, the maximum that can happen is an increase by a couple of percentages, whereas, if he works hard on a student getting say 35% marks, there is a possibility of him or her moving up by 15-20% if not much more.", "In the end, let me say that when dealing with talent: (a) Create clear cut deliverables (b) Create creative tension (a little pressure) (c) Encourage mobility - both horizontal and vertical, and within and outside the organisation and; (d) Delayer the organisation Also, as we are talking of talent management, let me add an element of work culture - we, all of us, somehow tend to ignore the role of culture in talent management.", "Let us develop a culture in which people who perform are celebrated as heroes.", "If you incentivise the heroes, also disincentivise those who do not perform.", "After having talked so much on talent, as an antithesis, I want to let you ponder over what Albert Einstein said about his talent: \"I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent; curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas.\"", "Ladies and gentlemen, I hope whatever you have learnt today will put you in good stead and you will put them to good use in your organisations.", "I wish the follow up of the action points of this Seminar a success and thank you.", "Select References : You Don't Grow Talent, You Spot It -
