to raise loans in domestic currency, particularly loans with long maturities.", "Attempts were made to keep inflation and the magnitude of foreign debt in check by pegging the domestic currency to the

implementation of reforms in the debtor country as part of an adjustment program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).", "Since 1956, the Paris Club has negotiated 417 debt reduction agreements with 87 countries.", "The Paris Club primarily negotiates debt relief with countries - often poor countries - that do not have access to traditional international funding markets.", "There is no supranational body for debt negotiations for countries that have borrowed in international capital markets.", "Some years ago, the IMF attempted to draw up a regulatory framework for governments and creditors, but did not receive the necessary support from member countries.", "The IMF's work has, however, led to more frequent inclusion of clauses in international loan agreements that facilitate constructive debt negotiations.", "In our economic system, the bankruptcy system is a useful instrument.", "It enables businesses to put earlier mistakes behind them and reemploy real capital and labour.", "Debt arrangements for governments can play a similar role and counteract downward spirals.", "(See Chart: Inflation.)", "There are two forms of debt default.", "Breach of contract is one form where the borrower fails to honour the contractual obligations, as illustrated in the example here.", "For debt denominated in domestic currency, the state can also default by pursuing an inflationary economic policy, reducing the real value of the loan.", "Over the past 100 years inflation in Norway surged during the two world wars and during the Korean War.", "The last period of soaring inflation was in the 1970s and 1980s, which resulted in a sharp fall in the real value of the bonds issued in the 1950s and 1960s.", "I would also like to cite a curious example from our own monetary history9: The Norwegian state took advantage of a fall in the value of money when it was to redeem government bonds issued between 1896 and 1909.", "France was one of the primary bondholders.", "The bonds were issued during the gold standard period when the value of the krone was directly linked to the value of gold.", "The lenders were promised repayment in \"monnaie d'or\" (gold coins).", "When the bonds fell due, the Norwegian government insisted on repaying the debt using banknotes that had lost a substantial share of their value.", "The case was brought before the Norwegian Supreme Court in 1962, and the Court invoked a law from 1923 stipulating that the gold clause, i.e.", "repayment in gold coins, did not apply when the redemption obligation was suspended, which it was definitively in 1931.", "The Supreme Court also invoked \"society's vital interests\" in its argumentation behind the decision.", "The cost of repaying the gold coins that were borrowed 60 years earlier would have been excessively high for Norwegian state.", "The ruling is probably an example of the limited benefit to be gained by a creditor when such a case is tried by the debtor country's legal apparatus.", "For Nicolai Rygg, governor of Norges Bank from 1920 to 1946, the value of money was a moral issue.", "The aim of the policy of gold parity in the 1920s was to bring the krone back to the value prevailing before World War I: \"Our monetary regime is enshrined in law.", "(...) The regime is anchored in our legal system, which we cannot break down.", "Inherent therein is a moral obligation to restore the monetary system to its previous condition.", "(...)

his eyes to the fact they are very serious.", "But the life of the people is eternal and this involves a decision of significance across generations.", "What is a sustainable sovereign debt load?", "A debt level that is high in one country can be sustainable for another.", "When Norway experienced payment difficulties in 1816, government debt stood at 6 million speciedaler, or about NOK 700 million at today's value of the krone, and was probably considerably smaller than annual GDP in the country at that time.", "Germany met its tolerance threshold after World War I.", "The Treaty of Versailles obliged Germany to pay war reparations to the allies after the war.", "The total sum of reparations was estimated at twice Germany's national income at the time.", "The annual payments, which were linked to export revenues, came to 5-6 per cent of Germany's national product.", "The economist John Maynard Keynes argued that it was impossible for the country to make these payments and that the reparations demanded would have fatal consequences, not only for Germany, but for all of Europe.", "\"I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.", "\"11 The countries that have defaulted on debt in the past two decades have systematically experienced problems when debt has reached around 50 per cent of GDP.", "Today, average sovereign debt for advanced economies is around 80 per cent of GDP.", "Japan's gross public debt - one of the world's wealthiest nations - is almost 220 per cent of GDP, but given its considerable assets net debt is about 110 per cent of GDP.", "Sustainability of government debt is to a large extent determined by a country's governance system, tax system and growth capacity.", "Developed democracies with sound public financial management and solid institutions have a considerable capacity to collect taxes to service debt.", "In developing countries and emerging economies, where tax collection and institutions are weaker, debt tolerance is lower.", "In addition, borrowing costs tend to be higher.", "On the other hand, they have greater scope for growing out of high debt.", "(See Chart: Debt at the time of default.)", "When the euro area was established, the Growth and Stability Pact stipulated that a country's budget deficit should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP and that debt should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP.", "When France and Germany were among the first countries to breech the criteria in 2003, the rules of the game were changed.", "This influenced the discipline of the other member states.", "It would almost seem that several countries viewed the limits as a floor rather than a ceiling.", "The crisis set in motion a dangerous debt dynamic, which can be illustrated by the following simple formula13: where changes in public debt (on the left) are determined by the variables on the right: the interest rate on the debt, nominal economic growth in the country and the budget surplus or deficit excluding interest expenses, referred to as the primary balance.", "If the changes in debt (left side) are set at zero, the right side of the formula yields various conditions that must be met to achieve stable sovereign debt.", "If the interest rate is equal to GDP growth, the debt will be stable when the government budget excluding interest expenses is in balance.", "If the interest rate is higher than the rate of growth, the debt burden will be heavier and the government budget will have to be settled in surplus before interest payments.", "If GDP growth is higher than the interest rate, the country's economy can grow out of its problems and sovereign debt will remain stable even with some degree of fiscal deficit.", "The formula also provides an answer to the question of why sovereign debt rose so rapidly in many countries.", "The term indicated by the circle is known as the snowball effect and depends on the difference between the interest rate level and GDP growth.", "Low growth or a fall in GDP results in a rising debt burden.", "When debt approaches an unsustainable level, investors will demand higher compensation for new loans and interest rates on loans will rise, hence the snowball effect.", "(See Chart: Fiscal deficit and Public debt.)", "Large deficits have a direct impact on sovereign debt.", "In the same period, public debt rose from 66 per cent of GDP to 85 per cent, and there are prospects that debt will approach 100 per cent of GDP in the next few years.", "Fiscal deficits in the UK and the US will reach 11-12 per cent this year and public debt is rising rapidly to high levels.", "In order to rein in this development, fiscal tightening must be implemented and government budgets must be brought into surplus.", "This can be particularly costly in downturns.", "Several European countries have recently announced tax increases and cuts in expenditure.", "This typically involves raising the retirement age, broad-based wage reductions and lower welfare spending.", "These sharp measures may well boost growth capacity in these countries in the long term, but in the short run they will result in lower demand for goods and services and probably lower activity.", "Since several countries are tightening fiscal policy at the same time, export markets may also shrink.", "However, reduced fiscal deficits will hopefully restore confidence in economic policy so that growth in household and corporate consumption and investment resumes.", "(See Chart: Sweden and Finland in the 1990s.)", "There are examples of heavily indebted countries that have stopped the snowballing process before it led to default.", "The banking crisis in the early 1990s left Sweden with a substantial fiscal deficit.", "Lower tax revenues, increased social security expenditure and rescue measures for banks brought the deficit close to 11 per cent of GDP in 1993.", "Sweden's public debt rose to 80 per cent of GDP.", "Fiscal consolidation continued for several years and resulted in stabilisation of government debt and provided room for its eventual reduction.", "The UK and Finland conducted a similar process in the 1990s.", "The Nordic countries in crisis at that time learned their lesson and have kept public finances in order during this crisis.", "The euro area countries are in a special position.", "They have a common currency and a common monetary policy.", "Governments raise loans in the area's single currency.", "Monetary policy - management of the euro's value - is a common policy, conducted by the European Central Bank with a view to maintaining price stability.", "The countries have common guidelines for fiscal policy, but as mentioned earlier, these have not been followed.", "On the contrary, lack of discipline has been inherent in the system.", "Confidence in monetary policy and general economic policy has been strong in the area and thanks to this confidence - and as free riders - countries have been able to raise loans at low interest rates.", "A committee headed by Herman Van Rompuey, President of the European Council, is assessing how coordination and monitoring of EU economic policy in the various countries can be improved.", "The goal is to reduce deficits and at the same time ensure that conditions are favourable for future economic growth.", "Without stretching the comparison too far, management of public finances in euro area countries can perhaps be compared to the management of Norwegian counties and municipalities.", "Under the law, they cannot go bankrupt.", "The government stands behind them.", "They have access to funding markets and can make use of the Norwegian central government's creditworthiness.", "There is an obvious temptation here to borrow too much - to act as free riders - that is reminiscent of the temptation faced by the euro area states.", "But the Norwegian system is balanced.", "If local government administrations in Norway borrow too much, the central government intervenes.", "Municipalities and counties with a budget imbalance must apply to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development for approval when decisions are made on borrowing or long-term leasing agreements.", "The county governor, as representative of the state, supervises the municipalities.", "About 10 per cent of Norwegian municipalities are currently in this position and are on the Norwegian ROBEK list.", "A firm hand such as this is lacking in the euro area.", "The Norwegian government's long-term obligations The Norwegian government's financial position contrasts sharply with developments abroad.", "While government debt in Europe is approaching 100 per cent of GDP, the Norwegian government has net financial assets exceeding 100 per cent of GDP.", "We have been lucky because we discovered oil and gas.", "The Norwegian state with its large territory - or should we say territorial waters - has been adept at reaping the economic rent from petroleum activities and managed to set aside a large portion of our petroleum revenues.", "Although the Norwegian government is not in a net debt position, it does have obligations under welfare schemes.", "These are not liabilities in the same legal sense as debt, but nor are they schemes that can easily be changed.", "The Supreme Court has established that future national insurance entitlements are protected, in principle, by Article 97 of the Norwegian Constitution prohibiting legislation with retroactive effect, but that changes to national insurance entitlements will only be in contravention of the Constitution if they are \"clearly unreasonable or unjust\".", "This gives the political authorities the freedom to adjust their obligations.", "Public occupational pension schemes seem to enjoy slightly stronger constitutional protection than national insurance pensions, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the authorities' need for freedom of action when it comes to making changes to pension schemes.", "The Norwegian national insurance scheme is a pay-as-you-go system.", "This means that a given year's pension payments from the scheme are covered by government budget revenues that year.", "When the national insurance scheme was introduced in 1967, a fund was established to provide for an expected reduction in private saving.", "However, pensions were still included in the central government budget at an early stage and financed by current tax revenues.", "Transfers to the National Insurance Fund were soon discontinued.", "Nevertheless, confidence in the pension system has actually remained intact, reflected in a low level of household saving, primarily through home investment.", "Perhaps there is some element of miscalculation here.", "A fall in value may occur if many homeowners free up (See Chart: Government Pension Fund Global.)", "housing capital to cushion old age.", "It was only when transfers to the Petroleum Fund were introduced in 1996 that funds were accumulated that could also be used to cover future pension payments.", "The Fund, which has since changed its name to the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), has grown to almost NOK 3 000 billion.", "Its rapid growth was neither expected nor planned and was due to the sharp improvement in government finances during the economic upturn from the late 1990s.", "After the turn of the millennium, the rise in oil prices also provided a boost.", "The size of the Fund is now equivalent to approximately 18 months' mainland GDP and may double in the next five to ten years.", "Total public expenditure is equivalent to less than half of total GDP.", "If the government spends 4 per cent of the Fund annually - the expected real return - this will finance close to 20 per cent of public expenditure ten years ahead.", "The return on the Fund will by then have become such an important source of funding that it is difficult to imagine that the government authorities would find any sound arguments for drawing on the accumulated capital.", "It is also a flow of revenues that does not have an (See Chart: Pension adverse effect on private sector production capacity, unlike taxes.", "obligations and the Government Pension Fund.)", "However, only a share of future pension payments will be matched by revenues from the Government Pension Fund.", "The Government Pension Fund is estimated to cover around half of the national insurance scheme's retirement and disability pension obligations.", "(See Chart: Pension costs and expected fund returns.)", "Over the next few years, the return on the Pension Fund is expected to rise roughly in line with government expenditure on retirement pensions through the national insurance scheme.", "Revenues from petroleum activities will nonetheless gradually decline, pulling down growth in the Fund.", "Over time, therefore, the national insurance scheme's retirement pensions will grow considerably faster than the expected real return on the Fund.", "(See Chart: Generational account.)", "However, it is wrong simply to compare the Pension Fund and obligations under the national insurance scheme.", "The government has the option of taxing households and businesses, and this naturally also has a considerable net present value.", "Generational accounts allow for this.", "These accounts show whether there is a need to raise taxes or lower expenditure for the government budget to balance in the long term, based on forecasts for benefit and pension payments and oil revenues.", "The generational accounts reveal that there is currently a need for fiscal tightening equivalent to 10 per cent of GDP or of the order of NOK 200 billion.", "Longterm forecasts from the Ministry of Finance, that also take the pension reform into account, show a shortfall of around 6 per cent of mainland GDP.", "Calculations by professors Alf Erling Risa and Erling Va\u030ardal here in Bergen paint a similar picture.", "The need for fiscal tightening roughly corresponds to current spending of oil revenues.", "Estimates of this kind are highly uncertain by their very nature and, as we can see, have varied over time.", "Although Norway is in a stronger starting position than other industrialised countries, with considerable wealth at the government's disposal, these calculations show that there are certainly clouds on the horizon.", "Increases in oil revenue spending cannot be sustained for much longer.", "Production of oil and gas will decline.", "At the same time, we have been through a period where the need for welfare services has been relatively stable.", "The dependency ratio has shown little change.", "Demographic developments will not be as favourable in the coming decades.", "Although we have built sound institutions for the management of our petroleum wealth, it is too early to say whether Norway is managing its wealth soundly.", "And although there has now been considerable pressure to increase oil revenue spending, there is good reason to believe that future generations will
