uncertainty about the future for those who have to plan for the long term.", "Confidence in the commitment to price stability was gradually built up after parliament in 1830 decided to base the

globalisation.", "Realignment of Sweden's economic policy It may be asked whether the good growth at present can also be attributed to a realignment of Swedish economic policy.", "There are no doubt those who consider the political decision-makers could have gone further in this direction, just as there are others who think they have gone too far.", "I shall not enter that discussion but simply note that a number of important decisions have been made in the past ten to fifteen years.", "They include the deregulation of credit and foreign exchange markets, the reform of the tax system, changes to components of the transfers system and the enhancement of competition.", "All this has helped the Swedish economy to function better.", "Moreover, price stability is now monetary policy's statutory objective and the Riksbank, now also formally independent, has been made accountable for this.", "Other steps, in the form of a far-reaching consolidation of the government budget, provide a stable and credible framework for this objective.", "As a further move in the new direction of economic policy, Sweden joined the European Union in 1995.", "This opened up sectors that previously had been protected from international competition.", "Competition grew in many fields and prices for some goods and services began to be adjusted downwards towards European levels.", "The economic policy realignment, which began some time in the 1980s, has coincided with larger changes in the global economic environment.", "The Swedish economy has therefore been in a position to benefit from the

of the countries where the IT sector is relatively large.", "This sector is also contributing a growing share of our annual output.", "But we are also one of the countries with a relatively high level of spending on the introduction of new information technology in various parts of the economy.", "The introduction and development of information technology in Sweden has been facilitated by an efficient capital market, particularly as regards the supply of venture capital.", "So, as I have tried to show, the favourable economic development at present has many aspects.", "But it should not be forgotten that the fundamental economic laws still apply, just as they did in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.", "That makes it important to prevent a build-up of imbalances that can create tensions and jeopardise a continuation of good economic growth and low unemployment.", "This brings me to the subject of stabilisation policy.", "Strong economic activity We can look back on several years of strong economic growth.", "This has occurred in an environment where price and wage increases have remained comparatively low even though the economic upswing is now in its seventh year, with annual GDP growth averaging around 3%.", "In recent years, annual demand growth has been in the region of 3 to 4%.", "A common, though not entirely certain, estimate is that in the long run the Swedish economy can sustain an annual growth rate of 2 to 2.5%.", "So the economy has been expanding faster than the supply side can cope with in the longer run.", "This is liable to result in problems with bottlenecks.", "That in turn can generate growing tensions and accelerating rates of price and wage increases.", "In the worst case, the result could be a recession, with falling output and rising unemployment.", "It goes without saying that that must not happen.", "The \"maintain price stability\", Riksbank is required by the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament) to which involves ensuring that the rate of price increases is kept stable around the 2% target.", "If we can manage this and take timely measures that prevent imbalances from arising, economic growth will normally follow the long-term trend.", "As the economy has been expanding above its sustainable rate, the spotlight falls on the amount of unutilised resources.", "When resource utilisation is liable to generate upward pressure on prices, the economy must wind down from the strong upward trend to a stable rate that is more sustainable.", "A rapidly expanding economy is liable to encounter bottleneck problems because new production facilities are not always available just when demand is rising.", "Experience from the 1990s suggests, however, that firms are more flexible than they used to be.", "This applies both to the utilisation of the existing capital stock and to investment in machinery and plant and the introduction of new technology when demand does pick up.", "The amount of unutilised capital resources may therefore not be the important factor at present.", "Instead, an analysis of the amount of unutilised resources in the Swedish economy should probably focus on the labour market.", "Another reason for this is that in a macro analysis of price trends, wages are the largest component of costs, being equivalent to over two-thirds of GDP.", "In an economy that is moving closer to full resource utilisation, one can accordingly expect certain phenomena to occur with a greater intensity and frequency.", "This refers, for instance, to companies reporting difficulties in recruiting competent labour.", "It can also take the form of a greater propensity to resort to disputes, both regular strikes and unlawful action.", "Firms are also forced to compromise when recruiting and employ less qualified personnel in order to cope with demand for goods and services.", "The matching of job seekers with job vacancies has functioned better than expected and to date this year the wage statistics show increases that, if anything, are slightly lower than expected.", "During the past year, however, there have been certain signs of incipient tensions between demand and supply.", "Firms are already having difficulties in recruiting some categories of labour.", "Shortages have not yet reached alarmingly high levels in general but each measurement is higher than the previous one.", "Moreover, the situation is more strained in some parts of the country than in others.", "It also seems to be considered that those in work have increased their negotiating strength.", "How else is one to explain that, according to the negotiating parties, wage demands in the coming round are higher than on the previous occasion?", "That at least is the picture which has emerged in recent weeks.", "Could this be a sign that the Swedish economy is approaching the point at which the increase in wage costs begins to accelerate, albeit from moderate levels?", "If that is the case, it can be concluded that, if the present rate were to continue, the Swedish economy is moving towards a situation where resource utilisation will be unduly strained.", "A gradual adjustment of demand to the long-term growth trend can result from a spontaneous slowdown in the economy, for instance because external demand slackens.", "It could also come from more subdued household demand for durable goods after the extensive purchases in recent years.", "Another possibility is a damper on demand from a diminishing effect of the positive supply shocks that have depressed prices and thereby benefited real wages.", "To some extent there have been a number of signs of more subdued growth in the rest of the world, above all in the United States.", "Moreover, new statistics suggest that Swedish households are not quite as optimistic as before.", "Somewhat weaker car sales may be an indication of more subdued demand for durables.", "Asset prices also seem to be in a calmer phase.", "All of this may point to some slowdown in the development of demand.", "It is still a matter of forward indicators and we have not yet seen any clear outcome in the statistics.", "Neither does there seem to be any notable fall-off in labour demand.", "The number of new job vacancies continues to be comparatively high, at least to date.", "In the absence of a sufficient slowdown in demand, an adjustment to the long-term growth path will need to be achieved with interest rate increases by the Riksbank.", "It seems to me that it is deliberations of this type that the Riksbank will face at the coming monetary policy meetings.", "Consideration will also have to be paid, of course, to the inflation risks associated with the high price of oil and the high dollar rate.", "These were some of the risks we highlighted in the October Inflation Report.", "This type of discussion about the direction of stabilisation policy basically deals with how, after some favourable years in the late 1990s, we should act so that growth and employment in the Swedish economy can be sustainably high and stable.", "The Riksbank's assignment from the Riksdag requires that we do what we can to ensure this."],
