or they have lost their place of pride in the home - to home entertainment units packed with latest movies, music and Play Stations, to mention but a few.", "This situation has been compounded by the non-availability of sustainable library services in our schools, colleges, universities and public libraries.", "At the moment the better library services are being provided mainly in the urban areas, for instance, by development partners such as the British Council in Lusaka.", "This clearly needs augmentation by all interested stakeholders to set up libraries both in the urban and rural areas.", "The other aspect that, therefore, needs to be addressed, in relation to the theme of the Book Fair, is the availability of appropriate reading materials.", "Achieving a sustainable economic future requires the active participation of a dynamic private sector.", "Such dynamism requires the availability of relevant and specialised reading materials.", "The agricultural sector, for example, is an important part of the Zambian economy whose success holds the key to the rapid reduction in poverty that must be achieved if Zambia is to take its place amongst the community of progressive nations.", "Higher literacy levels in the rural areas will help to propagate better farming methods and conservation techniques.", "These are methods that contribute to sustained economic growth and protect the environment.", "Master of Ceremonies, Ladies and Gentlemen, The development of a reading culture in our nation should be placed high on the national agenda if we are to achieve a sustainable economic future as a country.", "I am aware of the initiatives that the government through the Ministry of Education has come up with to encourage reading at an early stage.", "The primary reading programme and the concept of reading tent by the Zambia Library Service are some of the initiatives aimed at inculcating the habit of reading at an early age.", "Other partners in development such as the private sector and our cooperating partners have also been active.", "Important examples include the introduction of a reading bus by the British Council.", "All of these initiatives will contribute positively to the development of the reading culture.", "They certainly are encouraging, but more needs to be done.", "Particularly, the other key stakeholders who are parents and guardians of our school going children who should take interest in ensuring that children develop a culture of reading and writing.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, In closing my opening remarks, I wish to point out that currently most Zambian publishers are pre-occupied with the development and publication of core school textbooks where the market is readily available.", "I wish to challenge publishers to invest some of the profits in the publication of more diverse reading materials including Braille, music and physical education books.", "As you may be aware, a literate citizenry is a key prerequisite for a sustainable economic future.", "It is now my honour and privilege to declare the 2008 ZAMBIA BOOK FAIR officially open.", "I thank you all for your kind attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Reading", "Sustainable economic future", "Literacy", "Education", "Books", "Zambia", "Economic development", "Central banks", "Communication", "Financial system"]}
