capital markets.", "These respective components have been progressively liberalized over the years, allowing for more foreign presence in the market to become internationally more integrated.", "This

Islamic finance through the development of Malaysia as an international Islamic financial centre (MIFC).", "We also recognize the fact that the global business community of Islamic finance needs to grow in order for the broader global community to benefit from its value proposition, as only then can its growth potential be fully harnessed.", "With this in mind, Malaysia actively engages the global community to develop Islamic finance together by sharing our experience and providing the technical know-how on the industry.", "Deriving strength from our progress and achievement on the domestic front, Malaysia offers a workable model of development which can be deployed not only in other traditional Muslim countries, but also in other centres seeking to work together in developing a specific segment of the market.", "Indeed Islamic finance has now entered a new phase of development, where participants and businesses have become more internationalized.", "Another priority in facilitating global integration of the Islamic financial system which is high on our agenda is in ensuring Malaysia's continued active and meaningful role in contributing to the development of

advanced education in Islamic finance, while, the International Shariah Research Academy (ISRA) was founded to promote research and rigorous intellectual dialogue among Shariah scholars and practitioners on Islamic finance.", "Let me now turn to the development of our legal framework, which has been one of the key factors contributing to the competitiveness of Islamic finance in Malaysia.", "Our legal infrastructure consists of effective regulatory and substantive laws, as well as dedicated adjudicative platforms to undertake legal redresses arising from disputes revolving around Islamic financial transactions.", "The legal infrastructure in Malaysia evolved in different phases over the years.", "Our initial focus was to establish dedicated enabling substantive laws for Islamic finance, such as the Islamic Banking Act 1983 and Takaful Act 1984.", "The enactment of these laws provided the platform for separate regulatory framework for the industry and importantly, established the foundation of the Shariah governance framework through two key provisions.", "These are the requirements imposed on Islamic banks and takaful operators to ensure that their business aims and operations are Shariah-compliant and the need to form separate Shariah board within their respective institutions.", "Our experience has shown that dedicated laws governing institutions authorised to conduct Islamic finance are critical elements in instilling and maintaining public confidence in the system.", "After establishing the necessary legislative measures to establish a more conducive environment for Islamic finance to thrive, the next phase was aimed at creating the critical mass which was essential to develop Islamic finance in Malaysia.", "Amendments were made to the Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 to allow the conventional banks to operate Islamic windows which brought about new players in the industry.", "At this stage we also saw the establishment

transactions which has benefited our players, consumers and the development of Islamic finance as a whole.", "The policy, which was later emulated by many countries around the world, ensures

conventional banking.", "The most recent development of Malaysia's legal infrastructure for Islamic Finance was the enactment of the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009.", "Our Central Bank of Malaysia

the development of Islamic finance.", "Importantly, a supportive judicial system helps create an environment where players and consumers are able to execute financial transactions efficiently, with sufficient certainty and enforceability.", "In recent times, we have witnessed a number of legal disputes involving Islamic Financial transactions that have been brought to the common law courts for settlement.", "These recent cases tried in the English courts have highlighted the hesitancy on the part of the common law judges to deliberate on issues concerning Shariah principles in Islamic finance transactions.", "This is quite understandable given the lack of expertise on the matter.", "While evidence on Shariah matters can be admitted from subject matter experts but such evidence or advice is not binding.", "The scenario in Malaysia is different.", "We have a dedicated High Court for Islamic finance related cases and our judges shall refer to the SAC for questions or rulings relating to the Shariah and these rulings are binding.", "Malaysian courts, therefore are well equipped to uphold the sanctity of the Islamic financial contracts as they have the avenue to make references.", "They have the capability to preside over such cases and give firm, consistent decisions with the backing of SAC rulings.", "As part of our collaborative effort to expand human capital development initiative, measures are being made to ensure that players within the industry including judges and lawyers are trained in Islamic finance.", "Moving forward, with the existence of a

impediments that might hinder Islamic finance.", "What lies ahead is to harmonise existing laws such that it accommodates and facilitates Islamic finance in the most legally efficient way possible.",

our laws have to be facilitative and contemporary.", "Countries that intend to promote Islamic finance must also have laws that are clear and easily enforceable.", "In this respect, having common laws, or a reference point for laws on Islamic finance, would serve to benefit the industry worldwide.", "To this end, we are pleased to announce the formation of a Law Harmonisation Committee.", "This committee comprised members from among key government stakeholders, including the Attorney General's Chambers as well as industry players and experienced Islamic finance legal practitioners.",

reliable forum for settlement of legal disputes arising from Islamic financial transactions.", "The support provided by the legal fraternity to Islamic finance has been instrumental to the progress of the industry.", "Crafting legislation to facilitate the growth and development of Islamic finance requires dedication and skill, and the ties that have since developed between lawyers, regulators,

close collaboration to continue so that more pioneering progress can be achieved in paving the way towards greater international integration and expansion of the Islamic finance industry.", "Towards this end, the legal practitioners should work together to create a network to foster its development.", "This might involve the setting up of a specific association of international groupings of
