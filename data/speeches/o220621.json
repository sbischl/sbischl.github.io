in the euro area it is 6.8 per cent.", "As is evident, the circumstances are very different.", "\u2022 The rise in U.S. inflation is, to a significant extent, being driven by demand pressures.", "In the euro area, inflation mainly reflects supply-side factors, especially energy shocks and supply side bottlenecks.", "\u2022 As you know, monetary policy is not very efficient in the face of supply-side shocks.", "Inflation is also projected to return to significantly lower levels in the medium-term.", "\u2022 Accordingly, the ECB Governing Council has decided to normalise monetary policy at a gradual and flexible pace.", "\u2022 Can monetary policy normalisation afford to be gradual?", "\u2022 The answer is positive.", "During the past 20 plus years the ECB, like the Federal Reserve, has built up credibility.", "\u2022 This credibility helps explain why long-term interest rates remain far below those of the late 1970s and early 1980s when central banks had not earned credibility.", "\u2022 The credibility also explains why all measures of inflation expectations remain firmly anchored near our 2 per cent objective, while there is no evidence of significant second round wage effects.", "\u2022 What this means, however, is that policy makers must keep their focus on their medium-term inflation objective.", "As long as inflation expectations are in line with that objective, we are able to normalise our policy stance in a gradual way.", "\u2022 At the same time, in last week's Governing Council statement, we expressed our resolve to address tightening financing conditions and fragmentation risks.", "We will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, or PEPP, in order to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy impulses across the entire euro area, which is important for delivering on our price stability mandate.", "In addition, a new instrument is also under consideration to temper fragmentation episodes.", "\u2022 High uncertainty due to the economic and financial consequences of the war in Ukraine, combined with the fact that the euro area is a complete monetary union but an incomplete fiscal, banking and capital markets union, that is an incomplete economic union, is very likely to cause fragmentation episodes.", "\u2022 In this new and highly uncertain environment, we look to academics and researchers to guide us through uncharted waters.", "\u2022 The Bank of Greece has an active Research Department which pursues several avenues of economic and financial research, both theoretical and empirical.", "Some of these are: -the stabilising properties of alternative interest rate rules in the face of exogenous demand and -the effects of the zero lower bound on the properties of alternative international monetary -the macroeconomic implications of inflationary shocks that originate from the imports and the non- tradable sectors -the pandemic as a reallocation shock -time-varying estimations of the Philips curve -the effects of central bank balance sheets and central bank liquidity support -and explorations of newly available micro-level price data \u2022 I am looking at your seminar programme for the coming two days and I see a rich and diverse list of topics, covering climate risks, international capital flows, liquidity management over the global financial cycle, as well as issues pertaining to global and local supply chain bottlenecks, TFP and regional trade.", "\u2022 I'm sure that your seminar will provide plenty of food for thought and for stimulating discussions, which may help shed some light on the uncertainties facing policy makers today.", "\u2022 I would think that the session on the aggregate effects of global and local supply chain bottlenecks during the last two years and the session on inflation effects of stockouts will be especially relevant for policymakers.", "I am aware that NBER researchers are bound by the restriction that they may not make policy recommendations.", "That restriction, of course, does not prevent others, including policymakers , from using the NBER's research findings.", "\u2022 I wish you an interesting and fruitful seminar, and a pleasant stay in Athens."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Monetary policy", "Inflation", "Ukraine war", "Supply shocks", "Fiscal policy", "Euro area", "Central bank credibility", "Fragmentation", "Research", "Supply chain bottlenecks"]}
