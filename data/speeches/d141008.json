even if they do meet the indicator limit within each half-year.", "Spreading the refinancing requirement reduces the risk that many borrowers will see their interest rates fixed at a high level at the same time, while also reducing the volume of bonds that can experience maturity extensions at the same time.", "However, the Supervisory Diamond is not suitable for limiting the individual household's use of deferred amortisation.", "The mortgage banks have granted many households deferred amortisation loans right up to the LTV limit of 80 per cent.", "That makes the mortgage credit system vulnerable if house prices fall.", "It is essential to design the mortgage credit system in such a way that bonds remain secure and the system is still robust in periods when house prices fall.", "The level of interest rates has a strong impact on house prices.", "If interest rates remain at the current very low level for a long period, prices may rise substantially, but if interest rates go up, house prices could fall sharply.", "The wide- spread use of variable rate loans means that many homeowners have no protection of their home equity if interest rates rise.", "That requires a certain degree of financial resilience.", "So it is important for homeowners to build up home equity over time, thereby moving away from the maximum LTV ratio.", "To supplement the Supervisory Diamond, Danmarks Nationalbank therefore recommends introducing legislation to reduce the maximum limit for deferred amortisation loans as a ratio of the value of the home at the time of mortgaging.", "This may cause house prices to rise a little more slowly for a while, but the effect will be limited.", "The reduction should apply to deferred amortisation loans underlying covered bonds, covered mortgage bonds or mortgage bonds issued by banks and mortgage banks.", "In this way, borrowers will automatically build up a certain distance to the maximum LTV ratio over time.", "That will further underscore the mortgage credit system's high degree of security -

preferably at an early stage when habits have not become ingrained yet.", "Outside the banking union, anything could happen.", "Suppose that all sorts of decisions are made by those in the union - why should they consider the wishes of a marginal little player from the north who does not even want to join in?", "They will not have evil intensions, but on the other hand they are hardly likely to worry too much if gains within the union come at a price for those outside the union.", "If Denmark joins the union, it will be a different situation altogether.", "Can the mortgage credit sector participate in this cooperation?", "Yes - I cannot imagine Denmark joining the union at expense of the mortgage credit.", "Besides the fact that the ECB has a general obligation to take different business models into account, I believe there is a real chance of obtaining further security in the form of an explicit statement in a potential Danish participation agreement.", "The ECB would have to help find sensible solutions for the Danish mortgage credit sector, and along with the familiar faces from A\u030arhusgade they will be paying you supervisory visits.", "Overall, this provides the best conditions for spreading awareness of the Danish mortgage credit model.", "Today, on the anniversary of the referendum on Danish membership of the EC, I think it would be appropriate to highlight an important aspect of the banking union that is sometimes overlooked in the debate on the single supervisory and resolution mechanisms: the banking union extends and strengthens the single market for financial services.", "It offers increased competition on prices and products to the benefit of Danish citizens and firms.", "For competitive financial enterprises based in Denmark, growth opportunities increase because the banking union provides a level playing field.", "I realise that Denmark will not be joining the banking union in 2014.", "But in 2015 we will know more about how it functions and which banks it comprises.", "I would be greatly surprised if Danmarks Nationalbank does not have the same point of view then as now.", "We are firmly convinced that Danish participation in the banking union will serve the interests of ordinary Danes best.", "Ultimately, it is for the politicians to decide whether Denmark should participate in the banking union.", "But it is important that we have an in-depth debate in Denmark about this significant issue before the decision is made.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["mortgage credit", "housing market", "interest rates", "euro area", "Danish economy", "banking union", "ECB", "supervisory diamond", "house prices", "inflation"]}
