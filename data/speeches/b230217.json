pleasure to be here in Edmonton.", "We have all been going through challenging economic times recently.", "Almost exactly three years ago, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Canada, suddenly shutting down large parts of our economy.", "This upended our lives and livelihoods and created a huge disruption in financial markets.", "Fiscal and public health policies led the charge in tackling these dangers.", "The Bank of Canada played a key supporting role by reducing its policy interest rate to near zero and unblocking a financial system that was clogging up.", "The recession caused by the pandemic was unprecedented.", "Canada lost over 3 million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 14% in May 2020.", "And, as many here likely recall, oil prices even briefly turned negative.", "Fortunately, though, when the economy reopened after the mass closures, the rebound was also unprecedented.", "By the end of 2021, Canadian employment was 250,000 jobs above its pre-pandemic level, and the unemployment rate had fallen to 6%.", "But a storm was brewing.", "Supply chain bottlenecks, higher energy prices and a massive shift in global consumption patterns came together to spur inflationary pressures.", "The disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine only added fuel to this fire.", "In response, the Bank raised its policy interest rate to 4.5% in a series of rapid hikes.", "These interest rate increases are working.", "Over the past few months, inflation has started to come down.", "Recently it reached 6.3%, down from a peak of 8.1% last summer.", "This is a welcome improvement.", "But inflation is still too high and far from 2% target.", "At its current level, it continues to cause hardships for Canadians, especially the most vulnerable among us.", "While Canada may have turned the corner on inflation, we know that it will take time to get back to the inflation target.", "So, I'd to take this opportunity to talk about the importance of staying the course in the fight against inflation, despite the short-term pain that high interest rates can cause.", "First, I want to talk about the benefits of returning to the 2% inflation target.", "Specifically, emphasize how inflation dynamics tend to be self-stabilizing when inflation is near the target and how that helps the economy function better.", "also stress how low, stable inflation leads to better employment outcomes.", "Second, I'd to highlight the dangers of straying from the 2% target.", "talk about how the stabilizing forces I just mentioned can turn into de-stabilizers.", "The high and volatile inflation that can result is troublesome for many reasons, including the fact that it makes the price system less informative.", "This can undermine efficiency and weaken the competitive forces that help the economy achieve its full potential.", "Finally, I want to place the current Canadian situation in a global context.", "Although most of our trading partners are also experiencing high inflation, their paths back to their own inflation targets may end up being different than ours.", "Should this be a concern?", "We'll dive into that question.", "The benefits of being near the 2% target The Bank is fully committed to returning inflation to the 2% target.", "For three decades, this target has served Canadians well.", "And since it represents a sweet spot on the inflation spectrum, it remains the centrepiece inflationtargeting framework.", "Keeping inflation stable and predictable at that low level is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the economic and financial well-being of Canadians.", "To better understand the value of a 2% inflation target, we first need to delve into some of the forces that influence price-setting behaviour.", "These are illustrated in Figure 1, which will serve as a roadmap for much of my talk today.", "Inflation dynamics are driven largely by the cost pressures that firms face.", "These pressures can come from both domestic and international sources.", "Domestic cost pressures tend to appear when the economy is in excess firms face levels of demand beyond what they're able to demand-that is, when supply on a sustainable basis.", "As firms strain to meet that excess demand, they not only increase their prices but also bid up wages and the prices of other inputs as they compete with other firms for workers and materials.", "And since the goods produced by one firm are often inputs for other firms, this can lead to a second round of effects that further broaden and amplify domestic cost pressures.", "In this speech, I mainly compare 2% inflation with higher rates of inflation.", "However, the Bank has also studied the costs and benefits of lower rates of inflation.", "A key takeaway from that work is that the 2% inflation target provides a reasonable buffer against the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates.", "In contrast, lower rates of inflation entail a higher risk of ELB episodes.", "See, among others, Bank of Canada, Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target: Background Information-November 2011 (2011) and Bank of Canada, Renewal of the InflationControl Target: Background Information-October 2016 (2016).", "Of course, cost pressures can also come from international developments- things like disruptions to global supply chains and increases in the price of commodities such as oil.", "Figure 1 shows how these pressures impact the price-setting decisions of firms.", "Figure 1: Key forces governing firms' price-setting behaviour Domestic cost pressures International cost pressures (largely via excess demand) (e.g., global value chain disruptions, oil prices) pass-through pass-through Firms' price-setting decisions Inflation expectations anchoring anchoring Inflation target Inflation outcomes Low inflation environment High inflation environment But another key force affecting inflation is what firms expect to happen.", "These expectations matter because firms know that customers will ultimately judge prices in relative terms-that is, relative to the prices of other goods and firm's pricing decisions services trading in the broader economy.", "A are therefore based partly on what the firm thinks its competitors will do and where it believes overall inflation is headed.", "Now here's my main point.", "The key forces affecting inflation-that is, cost pressures and expectations-tend to behave differently based on whether inflation is high or whether the economy is operating close to a well-established and low inflation target.", "These differences are illustrated by the blue and red arrows in Figure 1. focus on cost pressures.", "In high inflation environments, firms tend to adjust prices more frequently-otherwise, their prices would quickly fall out of step with their costs and the prices set by other firms.", "This makes it relatively easy for firms to quickly pass on cost changes to their customers., In contrast, firms can make do with less frequent price adjustments when inflation is low.", "Rather than being passed on to customers, much of the day-to-day volatility in costs tends to be absorbed into profit margins when firms' costs and inflation is low.", "This lessens the likelihood of feedback into other prices.", "It also helps explain why low inflation tends to go hand in hand with less volatile inflation.", "We can see this pattern within countries over time (Chart 1) and across countries (Chart 2).", "Much as with cost pressures, a self-stabilizing mechanism can take hold around expectations when inflation is close to target.", "When a central bank has built up a credible track record of stabilizing the economy around a low inflation target, firms tend not to pay much attention to inflation.", "Rather than basing their expectations on recent rates of inflation or on short-term shocks hitting the economy, they're more inclined to settle on a simple rule of thumb that says inflation should continue to evolve in line with the central bank's target.", "For a formal model in which firms find it optimal to increase the frequency of their price adjustments when trend inflation is high, see, for example, M. Dotsey, R. G. King and A. L. Wolman, \"State-Dependent Pricing and the General Equilibrium Dynamics of Money and Output,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics 114, no.", "2 (1999): 655-690. firms' marginal costs in the For example, in standard New Keynesian models, the weight on Phillips curve governing inflation typically increases in a structural parameter representing the frequency with which firms adjust their prices.", "See, for example, F. Smets and R. Wouters, \"Shocks and Frictions in US Business Cycles: A Bayesian DSGE Approach,\" American Economic Review 97, no.", "For a complementary mechanism that also helps to make inflation more volatile when it's high, see M.
