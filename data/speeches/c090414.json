reflected in the reversal of investment flows, have been exerting pressure on the exchange rates.", "The depreciation of the local currencies is creating additional inflationary pressures while fiscal

global financial crisis on our economies has been on direct foreign investment s as many projects have either been suspended or cancelled.", "This has been due to a failure by many investors to raise

subsectors and mining related industries have also seen loss of jobs.", "The tourism industry is adversely affected with low occupancy rates while the horticulture industry has also recorded losses due to low export volumes as result of low demand and low commodity prices of vegetables and fresh flowers in European markets.", "The exchange rate has also come under severe pressure as foreign exchange inflows declined reflecting the deterioration in the balance of payments position.", "This is partly a consequence of reduced earnings from copper exports arising from the fall in copper prices.", "Further, the weakness of the local currency is a consequence of increased risk aversion to emerging and developing economy financial assets.", "Chairperson, the challenges arising from the global financial and economic crisis are huge but surmountable.", "Major economies of the world are putting in place various stimulus packages, which are expected to take the world economy out of the crisis.", "Without doubt, these measures will benefit emerging and developing economies as well, provided that were main committed to pursuing strong socio-economic policies.", "I urge all of us here present to be part of the solution and contribute to the economic recovery and prosperity of this continent.", "It is also important that we incorporate policy issues arising from this seminar in our
