Rwanda and Tanzania.", "I am further informed that a regional forum that will bring together all the East African key banking and finance players is scheduled for Arusha in the course of next month.", "The role of banking and finance in regional integration cannot be overemphasised.", "At the most basic level, banks facilitate trade and flow of funds and investments across the region.", "However,

private-public partnerships in the financing and implementation of key regional infrastructure projects.", "We would like to see our banks playing an increased role in such initiatives.", "Commercial banks must therefore facilitate long term financing projects.", "It would be apt at this juncture to commend the Kenyan banking sector that is well represented here today for expanding its footprint across the East African region.", "Regional banking is a relatively \"virgin\" service that should be encouraged.", "Your institutions will, however, require to be well capitalised to take advantage

varying regulatory regimes.", "Therefore, the harmonization of banking supervision and regulation continues to be at the top of the MAC radar screen.", "What has been our score card in this area?",
