conclusions.", "The world today is passing through a turbulent phase that requires a realignment of our leadership approach to managing a business.", "Today's business leader is faced with a multitude of challenges, both on external and internal fronts.", "The complexities arising in the eco-system of any business may arise in the shape of macro economic imbalances that include sagging demand, inflation, volatility in financial markets etc.", "While demanding situations on the internal front arise from personnel management, investment decisions, alignment and realignment of business

effective, the concern and tone for risk management must start at the top.", "You would agree that while the management may get influenced by business targets and short term profitability, the Board, representing owner's perspective, always targets for long term viability and sustained growth of the bank.", "By virtue of this different perspective and its legal powers, the board is better

taking for short term gains, inadequate Accounting standards and regulatory requirements in some areas, and mismatch between the remuneration systems and strategy and risk appetite of the company.", "Most of the multilateral agencies and financial regulators have now increased focus on building a more resilient financial framework including developing new standards for addressing the above challenges.", "Like any real life crisis, the present turmoil in the financial sector provides an opportunity to learn from the financial world's mistakes and overzealousness.", "This gives us the opportunity to look back and see what went wrong and structure our own financial houses so that this does not happen to us, or so severely affect the world again.", "In this regard I feel the most significant lesson that we have learnt from recent events is the importance of fundamentals in risk management.", "For instance there is a basic rule since inception of banks which says \"do not put all your eggs in one basket\".", "Had this simple rule been followed, many institutions could have avoided huge losses.", "The challenges posed by the Global Financial Crisis have impacted leaders of
