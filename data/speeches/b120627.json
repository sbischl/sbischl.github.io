to name just a few, are some of the successful entrepreneurs in the world, but they never graduated from college, nor did they pursue formal education in business or entrepreneurship.", "Yet from Microsoft to Virgin and other big businesses, they redefined what it takes to turn good ideas into lucrative businesses.", "We therefore acknowledge and recognise the important role the NBIC is playing in training, coaching and mentoring aspiring innovative entrepreneurs.", "We believe that NBIC provides a unique opportunity to exchange ideas, explore new businesses, discuss emerging technologies, share growth strategies and obtain insight from global business leaders, community leaders and worldwide experts.", "The Bank of Namibia is therefore very proud to be associated with the NBIC's quest to help people to create and realize their new innovative ideas.", "Indeed, as one of the sponsors of NBIC, today, the Bank of Namibia would like to reaffirm its commitment and support to this noble call.", "We have faith in what NBIC is doing and hope that it will continue to do even more.", "We know that NBIC's contribution to innovation and creativity will help greatly in the Nation's quest for employment creation and economic growth, and more so, for Namibia to become a competitive country in the world.", "On its part, the Bank of Namibia, together with the Ministry of Finance and support from other Government Ministries and Agencies will continue to persist in ensuring that the Financial Sector Strategy that makes access to finance for SMEs as one of its focal points is successfully implemented.", "This is in light of the fact that access to finance will go a step further in complementing the efforts of institutions such as NBIC and thereby ensuring that we create a vibrant culture of entrepreneurship as a Nation.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Without much ado, allow me to go to the second part of my task today to applaud the finalists.", "These are the people who worked late into the evening and early in the morning to come up with creative and innovative business ideas.", "On behalf of the Bank of Namibia, once again, I want to congratulate all the finalists of the NBIC Business Idea Competition and wish you the best of luck.", "We look forward to learning more about your innovative ideas and helping you to move them off the drawing boards and into the marketplace.", "Although, you have emerged as winners today, the ultimate winners will be the people whose quality of lives will be changed through the impact of your business ideas on economic growth and job creation in Namibia - through your hard-work and determination.", "Finally, I would like to leave you with these words from Steve Jobs as food for thought, \"I am convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the nonsuccessful ones is pure perseverance.\"", "Let's persevere, and make Namibia a truly competitive, global player.", "Ladies and gentlemen, it is therefore a great honour for me to present the awards to the winners of the Business Idea Competition."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Innovation", "Entrepreneurship", "Business Ideas", "Economic Growth", "Creativity", "Mentorship", "Persistence", "Problem Solving", "Financial Sector", "Education"]}
