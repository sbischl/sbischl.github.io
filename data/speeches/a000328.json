investment capital.", "Therefore, any society's long-term economic prospects are best served when households and businesses freely decide to save part of their current income.", "But the decision to save is not, in itself, sufficient to ensure economic growth and prosperity.", "Some institutional mechanism must exist through which society's savings can be collected and channeled into productive investments.", "Moreover, because savers will naturally perceive risk in parting with their money, they must be induced to entrust their savings to that institution that can then put their capital to work in sound and productive ways.", "For this to happen, a class of financial institutions must exist that the public views as a safe and convenient outlet for its savings, where at least some fraction of those savings are maintained in the form of highly liquid assets, and assets by which payments for goods and services can be made quickly, easily and safely.", "The single dominant class of institution that has emerged to play this crucial role of intermediating between savers and borrowers is the commercial bank.", "In virtually all countries, banks function as the repository of a large fraction of society's liquid savings and the entities through which payments are made.", "Even in mature industrial societies with highly developed capital markets, the commercial banking system continues to be the most important single element of the financial system.", "Transaction accounts - the means of intermediation The prominent position of banks in the financial systems of market economies around the world stems from their unique role as the issuers of transaction accounts.", "Transaction accounts are bank liabilities that are immediately payable on demand at face value -

the key to preserving public confidence The key to maintaining the financial integrity of any banking company - and, therefore, to preserving the all-important asset of public confidence - is the credit process.", "If credit is extended carelessly, banks are likely to incur losses, which in turn will undermine their ability to honor deposit obligations.", "And if banks' ability to honor deposit obligations falls into question, if the public's confidence is undermined, households and businesses will likely rush to redeploy their savings, raising the specter of a flight to cash and real assets with all the associated implications for inflation and destabilizing runs on banks.", "The best defense against this serious and very real threat is for banks to extend credit wisely, objectively and impartially.", "In this connection, it should be emphasized that, because of the inherently partisan nature of politics, and for other reasons as well, the government or state is not well-equipped to make credit decisions.", "Recent experience here in Asia, and before that in the former command economies of Eastern Europe, makes clear just how dangerous \"policy lending\" can be.", "Decisions as to who gets credit and who does not must be left to private initiative within a context where those making the decisions have a major stake -

those areas and individuals that generate profits for the institution.", "But if something goes wrong in the back office, it can quickly become the most important aspect of a bank's operations.", "It is essential that sufficient resources, staff and managerial attention are devoted to the back office and internal audit functions.", "Firmly rooted on the foundation of good corporate governance and rigorous internal controls is the central importance of effective risk management.", "As I mentioned earlier, banking by its very nature is a business of taking calculated risks.", "If they didn't take risks, banks could not perform their essential functions in a market economy.", "But sound banking also entails the prudent management of those unavoidable risks.", "Each banking institution must have in place the technical systems and management processes necessary to identify the risks associated with its activities - lending and otherwise - and to effectively measure, monitor and control those risks.", "But even if an institution has an effective risk management and control structure in place, that structure must also be accompanied by the institutional management culture required to ensure that written policies and procedures are actually translated into practice, with buy-in at all staff levels.", "And ultimately, an institution's culture is determined - once again - by the board of directors and the senior management it chooses to install.", "Management must take active steps to ensure that their commitment to an operating environment that includes effective risk management and rigorous controls filters down the line of the organization.", "To summarize, these aspects of effective bank level management - good corporate governance, rigorous internal controls and effective risk management - constitute a kind of internal safety net and represent the first and most important line of defense against potential problems.", "And this will increasingly be the case as the activities of banks and other financial institutions become more complex and more global.", "Market discipline After effective management at the bank level, the second line of defense against financial instability is market discipline.", "As financial institutions and their activities become more complex, diversified and global, market discipline becomes an even more important ally of the official supervisor.", "Of course, effective market discipline is not possible without meaningful public disclosure.", "While significant progress has been made in recent years, it unfortunately remains the case that disclosure practices have not kept pace with the rapid changes in banks' business activities and risk exposures, and with how these exposures are measured and managed.", "For this situation to be fully remedied, notions of what is proprietary information and what should be in the public domain need to change.", "Knowing a company's appetite for risk and its approach to, and methodologies for, managing risk is essential to understanding the risks of being a shareholder, a creditor or a counterparty.", "I strongly encourage all financial market participants to approach the issue of disclosure as of financial statements rather than as issuers.", "What we all need to know about each other to be comfortable and secure in making our credit decisions should drive the debate, rather than concerns about proprietary information.", "There is little question about the urgency of achieving dramatic progress in this area.", "Clearly, a full appreciation of risk cannot be achieved without sufficient information.", "All of us know that there is no greater enemy to a stable financial marketplace than a loss of confidence -

a remarkable achievement in its own right.", "Equally important, in my view, the document also balances the desire to set high standards for supervisory practices with the pragmatic recognition that not all countries are in the same stage of financial market development.", "As such, the Core Principles document is of particular importance for developing market economies, as it establishes a clear set of standards against which each country's current approaches and progress can be measured.", "It should be emphasized that, in attempting to craft a document that would have the legitimacy, quality and flexibility to meet the needs of bank supervisors around the world, the Committee made a conscious effort to consult broadly throughout the various stages of the project, and particularly with supervisors from emerging market nations.", "Some might argue that such extensive consultation slows down the process and dilutes the final product.", "Only through this inclusive approach could we design comprehensive principles with broad applicability and support.", "Last October, the Basel Committee, in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank, produced a follow-up document called the Core Principles Methodology.", "This report was initiated in response to requests from a number of countries for additional guidance on how to interpret and implement the Core Principles.", "The methodology document provides specific criteria for evaluating and implementing each Core Principle.", "One set of criteria focuses on issues deemed essential for the minimum implementation of the Core Principles; the other focuses on those issues deemed to represent \"best practice\".", "The IMF and the World Bank currently use the new methodology to assess the banking sectors in individual countries.", "It should be stressed that the most important efforts to implement the Core Principles are occurring in individual countries and, with this in mind, I am pleased to say that approximately 120 countries including many here in Asia - have now endorsed the Core Principles.", "Without the support and backing of national authorities to follow through with the implementation of these principles, our broader efforts simply cannot be effective.", "In this connection, the Basel Committee has long recognized the need for effective training of participants in the global supervision community, and over the years has sponsored numerous programs which have been beneficial in allowing supervisors from different countries to share experiences and exchange ideas for improved practices.", "In 1998, the Basel Committee, along with the Bank for International Settlements, jointly established the Financial Stability Institute, which conducts leadership training of supervisors in emerging market countries and facilitates technical assistance.", "This May, the Basel Committee plans to bring together supervisors from emerging market countries and representatives from the IMF and World Bank to discuss the lessons learned from this initiative.", "The May meeting is part of the Committee's ongoing commitment to ensure that the Core Principles remain current and relevant to bank supervisors worldwide.", "Let me move on to the Basel Committee's initiative to revise the 1988 Accord.", "As you know, capital has played, and continues to play, an important role in the supervisory tool kit.", "Adequate capital helps ensure that shareholders monitor the risk of financial institutions, and that management puts in place and maintains appropriate oversight mechanisms to help prevent problems from surfacing in the first place.", "Should an institution experience difficulties, capital serves as a buffer to absorb losses and reduce the risk of spillover from a problem institution to other financial institutions.", "The primary tool of capital regulation currently is the set of minimum ratios that were devised in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.", "They were set forth in an agreement known as the Basel Accord, and were adopted, among other reasons, to address the slide in international capital levels that was occurring over the previous decade.", "The Accord was clearly a milestone achievement for the first time, supervisors in G10 countries were able to use a common yardstick for assessing banks' capital adequacy.", "But the Accord has a number of serious shortcomings.", "For example, it does not adequately differentiate among degrees of credit risk and, as a result, banks have had incentives to take on higher risk exposures within broad risk categories.", "Banks have also tended to engage in transactions that lower capital requirements without reducing economic risk.", "In addition, it has proved difficult to incorporate into the Accord's simple risk-weighting scheme the innovations of the last decade in the way banks manage and mitigate risk.", "As market risk management techniques developed, we were able to incorporate a state-of-the-art, value-at-risk approach in a 1996 Market Risk Amendment.", "Still, as credit risk management techniques have advanced, and as the importance of operational risk management has increasingly been recognized, it has become apparent that the long run relevance and efficacy of the Basel ratios as an indicator of capital adequacy has been eroded.", "Supervisors have long known that analyzing simple capital ratios in isolation can lead to incorrect conclusions about the relative strengths of institutions.", "Thus, we also have relied on a review of banks' capital plans and on market discipline to assess capital adequacy.", "In June of last year, the Basel Committee formalized the link between these elements when it released a Consultative Paper laying out our vision for a new, more refined capital adequacy framework.", "In addition to establishing minimum capital requirements, the proposed framework places increased emphasis on the supervisory review of capital adequacy and the role of market discipline.", "We refer to these elements - minimum standards, supervisory review and market discipline - as the \"three pillars\".", "Together these pillars mutually reinforce safety and soundness by aligning capital relative to risk and by encouraging prudent risk management.", "This evolution in the Committee's thinking about capital adequacy follows from much of our recent work on risk management and the surveys we have conducted on banks' disclosure practices.", "It is also consistent with the broader notion of supervision I've discussed today.", "We encourage comments on the Committee's proposals from both supervisors and industry participants through 31 March 2000 - which is next week - and plan to publish, hopefully early next year, a comprehensive set of proposals that will be responsive to the comments and input we have received.", "Let me highlight briefly each of the three pillars and provide some perspective on the key challenges that the Committee faces in relation to each.", "The first pillar is minimum capital requirements.", "To address the shortcomings in the 1988 Accord, the Basel Committee has proposed two primary \u2022 an enhanced standardized approach that ties risk weightings to external credit assessments such as credit ratings; and \u2022 an internal ratings-based approach that would begin by mapping internal risk ratings into standardized risk weightings, but might eventually evolve into something closer to the full use of credit risk models.", "Each approach treats the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy somewhat differently and thus one or the other is likely to be relevant to banks with different levels of sophistication.", "Most importantly, both proposed approaches attempt to introduce greater risk sensitivity into the minimum capital standards to address the unfortunate incentive problems that have evolved from the 1988 Accord.", "Some observers - including, perhaps, a few in this room - have noted that the effort to incorporate greater risk-sensitivity into the framework inevitably introduces procyclicality into our standards.", "That is, the capital requirements for loans to troubled borrowers will tend to increase at just the point when such trouble is becoming apparent.", "This is an important point, and one that we at the Committee are working to address.", "It is my view that the global financial system needs to move toward addressing potential credit problems preemptively - before these problems have time to grow from minor disturbances into major disruptions.", "To best accomplish this objective, any supplements to regulatory capital should be incremental or graduated, rather than a sudden ratcheting that could potentially reinforce a cyclical downturn.", "The second pillar in the proposed new capital adequacy framework has to do with the supervisory review of capital - a critical complement to minimum capital requirements.", "The Consultative Paper proposes that supervisors should ensure that each bank has sound internal processes in place to assess the adequacy of its capital based on a thorough evaluation of its risks.", "In evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of a bank's internal allocation process, supervisors would draw on, among other things, their knowledge of best practices across institutions.", "I want to stress that this proposed approach in no way intends to replace the judgment and expertise of bank management, or to shift responsibility for capital adequacy to supervisors.", "On the contrary, it is well understood that bank managers have the most complete understanding of the risks their institutions face, and it is they and the bank's directors who have primary responsibility for overseeing those risks.", "The task for supervisors in this framework is to evaluate how well banks are assessing their capital needs relative to their risks, including whether banks are appropriately addressing the relationship between different types of risks.", "Most importantly, in proposing this second pillar the Basel Committee intends to foster a more active dialogue between banks and their supervisors.", "The third element in the proposed new capital adequacy framework is market discipline.", "As I discussed earlier, more extensive disclosure and a greater dependence on market discipline complements improvements in bank-level management, official supervision and minimum capital standards.", "Some areas that we at the Federal Reserve believe are good candidates for greater disclosure would include components of regulatory capital, risk concentrations and transactions involving recourse, such as securitizations.", "To the extent that banks develop disciplined internal approaches to evaluating capital adequacy, and greater disclosure enhances market discipline, supervisors will be able to place greater reliance on all three pillars and reduce regulatory inconsistencies.", "The common interest is to keep the Basel standards as a floor sufficient to ensure financial soundness, but above which banks themselves will choose to operate.", "In conclusion, we clearly have an ambitious agenda for perfecting and refining the supervisory framework for the twenty-first century.", "In implementing this agenda, we should always keep in mind the fundamental objective - preserving financial stability so that banks and the broader financial system can effectively perform their critical functions in a market economy.", "There is no question that the more effectively a banking and financial system operates, the more likely the economy is to flourish and the citizens of that society to prosper.", "This is particularly true in many emerging market economies that have a relative scarcity of savings in relation to their large-scale investment needs.", "The banking sector in emerging market economies also tends to be more concentrated and represents a larger share of the domestic financial system, suggesting that, if problems occur, they are likely to have an amplified effect on the real economy and on the fiscal cost associated with bank rescue and resolution costs.", "In pursuing the objective of financial stability, we must also acknowledge that both the public and private sectors have a critical role to play.", "While the perspectives of market participants and official supervisors may differ from time to time, our objective is the same - to maintain a strong and vibrant financial system over the long term.", "Indeed, it is clearly evident to me, as a former commercial banker and now as a supervisor, that only if we work together, each meeting our responsibilities and reinforcing the other, will we be able to successfully manage and supervise a rapidly evolving, ever-more complex financial services industry."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Bank supervision", "Financial stability", "Banking system", "Risk management", "Capital adequacy", "Core Principles", "Market discipline", "Internal control", "Basel Accord", "Corporate governance"]}
