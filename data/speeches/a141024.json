endeavour, the FSPB will promote, advocate and facilitate the identification, development and the adoption of professional and ethical standards across all sectors of the financial services industry.", "The primary purpose of such standards will be to clearly define the expected level of performance and ethical conduct that financial services professionals are required to achieve in the service of the public.", "It is particularly important that the standards are unambiguous about the values for the industry and its workforce.", "It would facilitate financial services practitioners to understand and embrace their professional obligations, and be held accountable for their own continuing professional development.", "Bank Negara Malaysia and the Securities Commission Malaysia
