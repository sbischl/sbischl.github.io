"Since 2000, the European Commission and also the ECB have been putting much effort into finding the reasons for the difference in productivity growth between Europe and the United States.", "Research has revealed that the difference is related to the development of information and communication technology.", "This development is as important as the electrification that started about 100 years ago.", "There are two reasons why ICT development explains the difference between productivity growth in Europe and in the United States.", "First, the ICT industry is more important in the US economy than in Europe.", "Therefore, favourable productivity developments in ICT are reflected much more clearly in the leading indicators for the US economy.", "In fact, one of the reasons why productivity figures in Finland are high compared with Europe as a whole is the weight of ICT in the Finnish economy.", "The second important factor is developments in services.", "Information costs plunged when

its part, provides the means to use information more effectively.", "It increases our brain power.", "In advanced economies, productivity growth depends not only on technological innovations themselves, but also on the organisational changes that are made possible by technological innovation.", "The wide utilisation of ICT and computers increasingly makes it possible to develop new and more efficient production and working methods in all economic sectors.", "But to adopt successfully new technologies and production methods, further efforts are required in reorganisation of work and business practises.", "Investment in training is also needed.", "Research on the effects of ICT has shown that the contribution of ICT to output growth initially corresponds to investment costs.", "However, over longer periods (3-7 years), output can exceed costs by large multiples.", "The output growth can be 2-5 times greater in the long run.", "These figures help us to understand why companies operating in competitive markets have significant incentives to adopt new technologies and why they at the same time reorganise their work and processes.", "Studies on the relationship between the introduction of ICT and organisational change have come to two conclusions: successful implementation of change requires innovative leaders and a staff that is well disposed towards the change.", "We come to the significance of education and training.", "It is often seen that, besides organisational changes and restructuring of work processes, productivity gains from IT also require a rise in the education level of the workforce.", "It is well-known that as ICT development has gained momentum, the demand for unskilled workers has decreased and unemployment correspondingly increased.", "The higher the education level of the workforce, the lower the level of unemployment.", "A closer look reveals that the connection between education and IT utilisation is more complex.",

mechanical tasks.", "These days workers monitor and oversee processes via computer terminals.", "The processes themselves have not changed very much, and therefore the worker must master them.", "The advantage of the new computer applications is that the software assists in controlling and monitoring the overall production process.", "They collect information on the whole process and present it for user viewing.", "This enables the user to get a broader overview at a glance.", "The main characteristic of the most advanced companies is that they have shifted the focus of work, education and training from mechanical tasks to problem-solving and communication skills.", "Previously when a problem arose, the worker told his superior.", "Today he is more likely to try to solve the problem himself, in order to avoid having a small problem become a large one.", "As I noted earlier, since the adoption of IT, productivity has increased most in the service sector.", "What is paramount for productivity growth is that all employees involved in a given process be able to use the required IT.", "The best solution to accelerate the implementation of changes is that the staff is involved in any project where new IT and related management systems are developed and applied.", "The employees know the products and services and their flows.", "As regards ICT based management systems, the overall process becomes more transparent and more easily visualised.", "The same work is performed - but with more efficiency, and possibly also with more pleasure.", "When a company is operating in a competitive environment, the pressure to be competitive is an important incentive to the company's management.", "If the company is unable to raise its productivity, new competitors will pose the threat of driving it out of the market.", "But on the other hand, raising productivity requires investment, organisational change, restructuring of processes, training of personnel, and a broad-based commitment.", "How can this be made to work?", "It is vital that the entire staff know and understand the market situation and the in-herent challenges so that they will share the company's visions and values.", "This is the foundation of commitment.", "The challenge lies in the unexpected speed at which external changes can take place.", "These are always a challenge for management.", "However, if the staff does not believe that increased productivity will improve the company's prospects and thus increase their job security, the commitment may not bee strong enough.", "This is why, in an environment of change, the securing of trust is critical.", "That brings us to the public sector.", "The increasing competition forces companies to be innovative and to raise their productivity.",

vision and persistence.", "Productivity is not raised by IT specialists, although their input is necessary.", "Productivity starts to increase only when work and the related processes are reorganised.", "And this is something that leaders cannot delegate to anyone else.", "In conclusion, future prosperity will be based on productivity growth.", "Information and communication technology
