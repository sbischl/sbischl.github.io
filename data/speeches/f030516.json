which are considered to be at the core of the system.", "Forgive me if most of my references are to the IMF since it's the one that I know most intimately and basically there is not too much of a cultural difference between it and its sister organizations.", "Let me first address the issue of the origins of the reform initiative.", "I think one can say that the multilateral agencies first got serious about reform around 1994/1995, when the global economy was blind-sided by the Mexican crisis.", "Here was a country that was doing very well, had just signed on to NAFTA a trading bloc with the US and Canada: was the darling of the financial markets, receiving sizable short term capital inflows: had followed almost all the policy prescriptions of the multilateral agencies: and literally found itself in crisis because investors suddenly became uneasy about the politics, and all the capital left.", "The exchange rate went through the roof, interest rates went beyond one hundred percent, and the banking system collapsed leaving economic stagnation and unemployment in its wake.", "What's worse, the Mexican crisis carried contagion effects and all Latin American economies began to experience capital flight and its repercussions.", "I think that this was the first clear evidence of the risks of globalization and the need to rethink the policies of the international financial agencies.", "Of course, after the Mexican crisis, came the Asian crisis in 1997/1998 raising new questions about globalization and IMF policies in emerging markets.", "Here was another case of widely recognized success stories (the East Asian miracle, you remember) that suddenly went sour.", "In a way the Asian crisis undermined the mystique and the self-confidence of the IMF and World Bank as even they began to second-guess themselves.", "By this time, of course, developing countries, the NGO's and all the critics that always had concerns about globalization and the \"Washington consensus\" felt that they were vindicated: that globalization and the IMF policies were responsible for increasing poverty and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.", "The massive protest at the WTO meeting in Seattle brought it all to a head and began an intensive process of soul searching among all the institutions.", "Professor Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 Nobel Prize Winner in Economics and former Chief Economist of the World Bank, and chief critic of the IMF is a strong supporter of \"globalization\", which he sees as a positive force that must be harnessed.", "He, however, also holds the view that the failure of \"the Washington consensus\" contributed to increasing poverty in many developing countries and caused financial crises in emerging market economies.", "He cites the IMF's biggest sin as its \"market fundamentalism\".", "In his view, the IMF became too obsessed by a belief in the perfection of markets and the imperfection of governments.", "He also believed that the Washington Consensus put far too much emphasis on fighting inflation or ensuring that Western banks got repaid, \"without showing feelings for the people whose lives were affected by policies\".", "Of course, the IMF has a different spin on what prompted reform.", "The Fund admits that it made some mistakes of judgement but insisted that it had nothing to do with the model, and that certainly, it was not a case of uncaring bureaucrats serving the narrow interests of the western financial The Fund would concede on hindsight that: community.", "(i) it lacked sufficient appreciation of the workings of international capital markets and as such underestimated the speed with which funds would flow in and out of open capital markets; (ii) with its excessive focus on fiscal policy, it paid inadequate attention to the importance of the soundness of financial systems and the propensity that these had for spreading crises; (iii) it showed excessive zeal in encouraging countries to open up to short term foreign capital, without recognizing that the volatility of these flows could have devastating economic effects; (iv) it could have put more emphasis on poverty alleviation and the need for social safety nets in periods of adjustment; and (v) it needed to improve its understanding of institutions and political dynamics in member countries.", "But so much for who was to blame and why.", "What has changed in the way in which the Bretton Woods institutions manage the global system?", "In principle, one could separate the range of reforms into two parts.", "You would recall my saying that from the Fund's view the main justification for reform was the fact of recurring global crises - first Mexico, then East Asia, then Russia.", "In these circumstances, the Fund took the view that the first responsibility of reform was to put in place a system that offered hope for avoiding crises and of resolving them quickly when they occurred.", "The second set of reforms has had more to do with how the Fund operates - its internal procedures and its relationship with its members.", "Let's first deal with the reforms to the international financial system - these come under a grandiose title of \"The New Global Financial Infrastructure\".", "(i) In view of the evidence that a weak financial sector is an invitation for financial crisis, which invariably has an extremely high social cost, the IMF undertook to make the focus on financial sector soundness to be a main pillar of its operations both in developed and developing countries.", "Now all countries - and we here in Trinidad and Tobago are no exception - are investing significant resources in trying to identify vulnerabilities in their financial systems and taking corrective action.", "The plan, here at home, to bring the insurance companies and pension funds under the authority of the Central Bank must be seen in that light.", "(ii) A second innovation to the system is the establishment of internationally-accepted standards and codes as \"rules of the game\" for all economies.", "Thus, working with other international institutions, we now have codes of good practice for monetary policy, fiscal transparency, insurance and payments systems, securities, corporate governance, accounting, statistics, bank supervision etc.", "We are in the process of adopting some of these standards.", "(iii) A major innovation to the financial infrastructure which is now being put in place is a new mechanism for dealing with crisis countries that have acute external debt servicing problems.", "In the case of the Mexican and Asian crises, the Fund and the World Bank provided most of the resources and in so doing faced the criticism that they bailed out western banks.", "To avoid this and to preclude prolonged negotiations with creditors the international community embarked on an intense search for a sovereign debt resolution model -

grant assistance) from the current level 0.2 percent of GNP to 0.7 percent of GNP.", "(iv) The agreement challenged the Bretton Woods institutions to improve corporate governance by increasing the participation of developing countries in their decision-making processes.", "Essentially, this would require a major re-distribution of shares and Board representation both in the IMF and in the World Bank.", "One proposal, for instance, is that since the countries of the developing world are the only borrowers, they should have at least one-half of the total shares which would give them some influence in the formation of the conditionality policies.", "The evidence suggests that the industrialized countries have not started to keep their side of the bargain and this is of concern.", "For example, since the Monterrey Conference the US increased various agricultural subsidies and the EU postponed reducing theirs until 2006.", "Moreover, few of the industrialized countries have begun to make good on their commitment to increase aid to developing countries.", "You may be surprised to know that the level of agricultural subsidies in the EU is six times greater than the level of overseas development aid.", "Nevertheless, the developing countries remain optimistic about the Monterrey Consensus which they still see as an excellent vehicle for achieving their development objectives.", "They are calling on the international financial institutions to set up systems to try to monitor compliance.", "Let me end with a brief summary examination of how the latest globalisation trends and the reform initiatives have impacted on the Caribbean region.", "Guyana is one of the 34 countries benefitting from the programme of special debt relief for heavily indebted countries (HIPC).", "You would recall that the essence of this initiative was that once the country could work out a suitable economic programme with the IMF, it would be entitled to a certain measure of external debt relief.", "Guyana has, therefore, been getting external debt relief from the multilateral and regional agencies (IMF, World Bank, CDB and IDB) as well as from bilateral creditors.", "The bulk of the bilateral relief (about US$ 360 million) is coming from Trinidad & Tobago.", "Because Trinidad & Tobago happens to be Guyana's largest creditor, through oil-facility loans extended in the late 1970s and early 1980s -
