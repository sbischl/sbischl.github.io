Vijaya Bhaskar, then Executive Director to recommend sturdy practices for financial benchmarks.", "The Committee made several important recommendations including creating an independent structure, separate from FIMMDA and FEDAI, the then benchmark administrators for the Indian Rupee interest rates and Forex benchmarks respectively, for administration of the benchmarks.", "This, as we all know, led to the formation of FBIL.", "The Committee also recommended that benchmark administrators be subject to regulatory oversight.", "In 2019, the Reserve Bank issued the Directions on Financial Benchmark Administrators putting in place a regulatory framework for benchmark administrators in the markets regulated by it.", "These Directions apply to 'significant benchmarks' taking into consideration their use, efficiency and relevance in domestic financial markets, while providing flexibility to the administrators with regard to other benchmarks and to facilitate development of newer benchmarks.", "The Directions set out the requirements for, inter alia, overall responsibilities of benchmark administrators as well as the framework for governance, controls and accountability in the benchmark administration process.", "RBI has notified the list of significant benchmarks in these markets and put in place an oversight framework for the administrators of significant benchmarks.", "Several enhancements have been carried out to the benchmark computation and administration process by FBIL since its inception.", "FBIL played a pivotal role in modifying existing benchmarks to conform to global standards.", "For example, the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), first introduced by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1998 and computed through a polling process, is now based on actual transactions.", "The Mumbai Interbank Forward Outright Rate (MIFOR) has been transformed into the Modified MIFOR using the alternate reference rate, secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) instead of LIBOR in line with the global transition away from the LIBOR.", "Modified MIFOR is now being used for all new contracts.", "New benchmarks have also been introduced in various market segments viz., Market Repo Overnight Rate (MROR), T-bill rate and certificate of deposit (CD) rate.", "Indian financial markets have witnessed substantial growth in the last few years, facilitated, in part, by the availability of robust benchmarks.", "The MIBOR benchmark is the underlying reference rate for MIBOR overnight indexed swap (OIS) contracts.", "There is also a growing offshore market for MIBOR based OIS (ND-OIS).", "In the currency market, the USD-INR Reference Rate is used by many domestic users, including corporates.", "The reference rate is used for settlement of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) and exchange-traded futures as well.", "The average daily turnover in INR NDFs has increased from around US$16.4 billion in 2016 to US$ 46.4 billion in 2022.", "During the same period, the average daily turnover in exchange traded currency futures in India increased from US$ 2.8 billion to US$ 6.6 billion.", "As markets have grown, the pool of assets using FBIL benchmark rates for valuation has also grown.", "An ideal benchmark is one which is anchored in observable transactions in a liquid market with a diverse set of participants and which remains robust in the face or market disruption and minimises scope for market manipulation.", "But the realities of many markets - globally and in India - are far from this utopian world.", "The reforms associated with benchmarks over the last several years have, therefore, focussed on effectively addressing the shortcomings in benchmark design and the absence of robust governance processes that contributed to past abuses and in instilling confidence in financial benchmarks through reforms in benchmark governance, design, quality and accountability mechanisms.", "Challenges with benchmark administration 10.", "All benchmarks are susceptible to weaknesses arising from the nonzero probability of errors of omission and commission, the liquidity and diversification of underlying markets, technology induced changes in market microstructure, etc.", "There is a need for constant vigilance on all these fronts even in the most liquid of markets.", "The need for vigilance is stronger still in case of benchmarks in less liquid / illiquid markets where benchmarks are based on polling and / or model-based rates.", "In the rest of my speech, I will dwell upon some specific features of financial markets in India which can pose challenges for effective benchmark development and administration and which we will all need to be cognisant and watchful about.", "Consider the overnight money market in India.", "In the call money market - used for the calculation of MIBOR benchmark - non-banks were phased out beginning from 2001.", "Prudential limits on borrowing and lending in the call money market by banks and primary dealers were also put in place in 2002.", "Synchronous with this, the repo markets were developed and repo in government securities (g-secs) witnessed robust growth in line with global trends towards collateralised overnight markets.", "Amidst these developments, call money transaction volumes declined -

the markets for treasury bills and CDs have witnessed impressive growth.", "But the growth has been driven by the size of primary issuances while the secondary markets continue to be characterised by low turnover.", "Here too, benchmark computation methodologies rely on statistical techniques.", "Instances of divergence between market prices and benchmark levels are, therefore, not uncommon.", "The end-quarter phenomenon that besets yields of T-bills and CDs, while not an infirmity of the benchmark per se, undermines their efficiency.", "The commercial paper (CP) market has also grown on the back of primary issuances, but again, with low secondary market liquidity.", "Issuances of similarly rated credit that take place at very different rates display different market perceptions across types of issuers (e.g., corporates and NBFCs) but even among the same type of issuers (Chart 3).", "This is perhaps one of the reasons why there are difficulties in developing and publishing a CP curve.", "Moving on to debt markets, the liquidity situation improves in particular in the government securities market.", "Here too, as liquidity is concentrated in a few benchmark tenors, use of models to arrive at the benchmarks across all tenors becomes necessary.", "Given the importance of government securities yields as the benchmark for pricing of most financial assets, there is a need for a suitable methodology to ensure that the benchmark yield curve remains robust and reliable.", "Idiosyncratic factors pose challenges in the computation of benchmarks for State Government Securities (SGSs).", "Similarly, thin secondary market activity and lack of access to market for borrowers with lower credit rating make benchmarking rather unwieldy in the corporate bond market.", "All these factors reinforce the need for continuing efforts to evolve benchmarks that remain relevant and representative of the market conditions and risk perceptions of the underlying instruments.", "Derivatives markets 18.", "A thriving derivatives market not only requires robust benchmarks, it can also facilitate further development of the underlying markets.", "Limited liquidity in derivative markets can therefore create distortions in benchmark values.", "For example, OIS rates, which generally remain below g-sec yields, have occasionally exceeded g-sec yields, impacted, in all probability, by non-residents' trading interest (Chart 4).", "Similarly, there have been episodes of negative spreads between near and far month forward premia (Charts 5 and 6).", "Such episodes can engender large basis risk and adversely impact the representativeness of benchmark rates.", "MIBOR OIS is the only pure interest rate derivative product in the domestic markets that is characterized by good liquidity.", "While this product has well served the purpose of allowing market participants to express their view on the future movements in interest rates, its utility as a tool to enable users to hedge their interest rate risks remains limited.", "Globally, term money market rates are generally used as the benchmark for interest rate swaps.", "In the domestic market too, there is a need for the development of term benchmarks which can be referenced by interest rate derivative products.", "This issue is becoming increasingly relevant with the recent push towards linking loan pricing to external benchmarks.", "Key Issues to Address 20.", "Beyond trading interest, there is a need to develop robust benchmarks and products which meet the need of hedging asset side requirements of institutional investors such as banks but also liability side requirements of borrowers exposed to benchmark based interest rates on borrowings and loan pricing.", "While the lack of adequate liquidity in some instruments is the primary challenge, the reasons for the limited liquidity vary.", "Growing offshore interest in INR products has resulted in globalization of domestic benchmarks.", "Discussed below are some of the issues that need attention to further the process of developing a robust benchmark framework in India.", "Diversified participation -
