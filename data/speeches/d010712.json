{"sentences": ["1 Introduction MAS has had an eventful year, shaping monetary policy in a challenging and uncertain environment and continuing to liberalise and enhance standards in the financial sector.", "Monetary policy In January this year, MAS decided to maintain the existing exchange rate policy stance of allowing a modest appreciation of the trade-weighted Singapore dollar within an unchanged policy band.", "This policy was aimed at capping medium-term inflationary pressures, while continuing to be supportive of economic activity as growth came off its cyclical high and moderated to a slower pace.", "Economic activity slowed much more in the first half of 2001 than was expected, causing market sentiment to shift against the Singapore dollar.", "Strong demand for US dollars to fund merger and acquisition activities by domestic corporates, and a strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies, exerted further downward pressure on the Singapore dollar.", "The S$NEER weakened over the period, from the top of the policy band at the start of the year to the lower half of the band at end June.", "This trend was consistent with the change in underlying economic and market conditions.", "Against the backdrop of a weaker external economic environment and a more protracted global electronics downturn, near term growth prospects for the Singapore economy have turned significantly weaker while inflationary pressures are subsiding.", "The slowdown reflects a decline in demand, not an erosion of competitiveness.", "There is no reason for any persistent weakening of the Singapore dollar.", "MAS has therefore shifted to a neutral exchange rate policy stance, with a policy band centred on a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER.", "MAS will continue to guide the S$NEER within this exchange rate band, and stands ready to intervene to dampen excessive volatility should this become necessary.", "Financial sector supervision and development MAS' financial sector policies seek to promote a sound and resilient financial system while facilitating innovation, dynamism and competition.", "Recent and ongoing initiatives by the MAS have focused on: harmonising regulation across the financial sector; liberalising access to the domestic industry; promoting corporate governance and market discipline; implementing a risk-focused supervisory framework; and developing talent in the financial sector.", "Harmonising regulation Convergence of financial activities and consolidation of financial institutions have made a more harmonised and integrated approach to regulation more urgent.", "Consistent regulatory treatment for similar products and activities will help level the playing field; it will also lower compliance costs by streamlining relevant regulations and reporting requirements across activities.", "As an integrated regulator, MAS has made significant progress in harmonising regulation.", "Recent and ongoing efforts have focused on the areas of licensing and capital adequacy.", "On licensing, there have been two major initiatives: the new Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and the new Financial Advisers Act (FAA).", "Public consultation documents and draft legislation of the SFA and FAA were released in March 2001.", "The Bills will be tabled in Parliament soon and are expected to be enacted by the end of this year.", "The SFA rationalises and consolidates into a single comprehensive legislation the Securities Industry Act, Futures Trading Act, and provisions in the Companies Act related to capital raising.", "It introduces a single, modular licensing regime for securities and futures intermediaries, which will enhance competition and lower compliance costs.", "The new legislation will also reflect initiatives that take into account industry developments brought on by globalisation and technological advancements.", "The FAA provides a single licensing regime and a more flexible and

disclosure.", "The Banking Act has been amended to give legislative effect to the policy requiring separation of financial and non-financial activities in Singapore banks and the unwinding of

business.", "Local banks, in consultation with MAS, are adopting corporate governance standards that will, in areas such as the independence of the Board and Board committees, go beyond the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Committee.", "For financial year 2000, local banks improved their disclosure of directors' remuneration, related party transactions, and risk management practices.", "They will disclose further details on these areas next year, putting them on par with their international counterparts in terms of public disclosure.", "Implementing risk-focused supervisory framework Recent regulatory reforms by MAS have also been motivated by the shift away from a \"one-size-fitsall\" regulation to a more risk-focused approach.", "MAS is now developing a new risk-focused liquidity supervision framework that will set a bank's liquidity requirement in line with its liquidity risk profile and liquidity risk management capabilities.", "This shift away from a

year.", "Its implementation will be phased out to minimise potential disruptions to financial markets.", "As business models and technologies continue to evolve, MAS has kept close touch with market participants and discussed with them the possible risk implications of new activities.", "We have avoided pre-empting market developments with premature regulation.", "Regulation has to be responsive but it cannot prejudge how the market will develop and business strategies will crystallise.", "MAS has issued regulatory guidelines on the provision of financial services through new delivery channels.", "Examples include the policy statement on capital treatment of internet-only banks; guidelines on technology risk management for all institutions engaging in internet banking; and sound practice guidelines on internet securities trading.", "The proposed SFA will introduce an authorisation regime to cater to new trading systems, often referred to as Alternative Trading Systems, so as

accounts, total assets increased by $15.2 billion to $130 billion as at 31 March 2001.", "The main components of the increase were due to a $12.1 billion increase in foreign assets and a $3.3 billion increase in our holdings of Singapore Government Securities (SGS).", "As in the last financial year, the increase in SGS holdings reflected MAS' strategy of building up SGS to engage in more repurchase agreement (repo) transactions for our money market operations.", "On the liabilities side, there was an increase of $14.7 billion in Government deposits with MAS, reflecting mainly increased issuance of SGS through the Authority.", "Income & expenditure statement For the financial year ended 31 March 2001, MAS registered profits of $2.1 billion compared to $3.6 billion in the
