the average 5 percent of the top 500 enterprises in the world.", "You can check the detailed data of Chinese enterprises at that time for yourself.", "Such comparison doesn't mean higher profitability

were actually needed, for officials in London thought India might be as cold a place.", "For China with a complex and large capital system, we could not imagine that a highly centralized approach

should be paid dividends depends on a clear property right structure.", "There is no need to complicate this matter.", "Conclusions In my personal view, to clarify property right and improve corporate governance, we should make efforts to reach consensus through discussion of dividends distribution by state-owned enterprises and investment returns of state owned shares in enterprises with mixed ownerships.", "In line with such a spirit, we have carefully studied and discussed property right reform for Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, hoping to avoid the co-existence of both listed companies and the legacy companies like before.", "All three conducted complete financial restructuring.", "Among them, China Construction Bank has less
