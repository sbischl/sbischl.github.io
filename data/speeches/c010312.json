of the subject areas, concerned governmental or regulatory bodies had already constituted some study groups and hence it was argued on occasions that the Advisory Groups are duplicating such efforts.", "In such cases, it became necessary to clarify that the work of the Advisory Groups is without prejudice to any other official and non-official initiatives, and that the work is It also became necessary to encourage the Advisory Groups not meant to be intrusive.", "to take account in their deliberations such parallel, though partial, efforts and provide appropriate inputs to such efforts whenever sought.", "The process was made easier in several cases since one or more members of relevant Advisory Group happened to be so eminent as to be involved in several of the

when the Group tended to comment on functioning of official bodies in the context of standards.", ".5 In the preparation of their respective Reports, most Advisory Groups have also been studying and reviewing international experience in various subject areas.", "In particular, the Report of the Advisory Group on Monetary and Financial Policies took comprehensive account of extant institutional

and international, would be also be identified and finalised in consultation with the Chairman of each Advisory Group.", "The Standing Committee would request specific comments/feedback on the

extensive references to this in several publications of Reserve Bank of India.", ".5 Fifth, several prominent intellectuals, professionals, and market participants contributed to the process of benchmarking, and identifying gaps and they participated in the exercise in a purely honorary capacity, as a national endeavor.", ".6 Sixth, such a process brought out the possible differing views between official bodies or authorities and domestic independent opinion as regards the extent of compliance with such codes and standards.", "It is considered necessary to recognise this and try to arrive at a consensus.", ".7 Seventh, to such an independent some concern on the part of official authorities assessment is understandable but could be significantly overcome through their participation as special invitees and the efforts of advisory group which have members of national standing.", ".8 Eighth, many areas of overlap among the areas covered by different Advisory Groups were observed.", "Also, each Advisory Group had to interact with several regulatory and standard setting bodies.", "The process thus becomes come quite complex, especially when the jurisdictional issues up.", ".9 Ninth, several standard setting bodies including professional associations and self-regulatory bodies of market participants involved with current practices have, on occasions had concerns about the Advisory Groups findings but special efforts by the Advisory Groups helped assuage these concerns.", ".10 Tenth, the work of the Advisory Groups required substantial technical and professional inputs located in several agencies, public and private.", "These had to be pooled and collated.", ".11 Eleventh, the Advisory Groups have found issues it difficult to focus entirely on compliance since there is a preoccupation with immediate issues of operational significance to the market participants and such issues may be policy or procedural or may even be of short term relevance.", "The main focus has not been, however, lost sight of.", ".12 Twelfth, the enthusiasm for disclosure and transparency in public agencies is not matched by eagerness to be transparent on the part of private sector.", "The private sector's participation in the process helped a better appreciation of the importance of disclosures.", ".13 Finally, four lessons from the exercise appear to be relevant.", "The process of implementation demands significant resources and is time-consuming.", "Moreover, most of the follow-up activities require some legislative changes.", "In the ultimate analysis, adoption of the standards has to be driven by self-interest of the country and attempts should be toward harmony and ultimate convergence rather than mechanical compliance."],
