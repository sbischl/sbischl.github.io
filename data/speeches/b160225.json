most notably in the United States - the stimulative effects of a lower Canadian dollar, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions.", "Indeed, the Bank's interest rate reductions in 2015 helped to reduce the probability of this risk materializing.", "Although the Canadian economy appears to have stalled in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect growth to pick up to 1 per cent in the first quarter and then to move above 2 per cent for the remainder of 2016.", "What is the assessed rating for this risk?", "Although there is a low probability of this risk being realized, the Bank's Governing Council assessed it as \"elevated\" because of the large potential impact it would have on the economy (Table 3).", "Mitigating the Vulnerability: The Role of the Bank of Canada While the expected uptick in economic activity will help stabilize household debt as output, incomes and interest rates rise, economic growth alone may not be sufficient to mitigate this vulnerability.", "Other policies should be adopted to complement the impact of economic growth.", "To promote the stability of the financial system, a range of policy responses can -
