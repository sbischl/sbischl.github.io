High Inflation is worrying; too low an inflation is upsetting!", "Excess liquidity is dangerous, but lack of liquidity is as troubling; The exchange rate is never favourable, whether for exporters or for importers; The policy rate, when it is high, is not helping businesses and borrowers and, when it is low, it goes against those who want to save...", "I could go on and on with the never-ending dichotomy of views and criticisms.", "Indeed, it is a tale of two cities!", "Ladies and gentlemen, Let me draw your attention to some facts which are true cause for concern for us as policymakers.", "The global economic uncertainty has worsened.", "The IMF and the World Bank have revised down their global growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020.", "The economic environment is becoming more challenging.", "Monetary policy is becoming more and more accommodative, as many central banks-both from advanced and emerging market economies-have been cutting policy rates aggressively to nearly all-time lows while others have embarked on quantitative easing to support their economies.", "To complicate matters, debt levels in many countries are constraining fiscal manoeuvres.", "The fact is that there is lesser and lesser room for dodging the bullet in case of a global recession.", "Some are concerned that our policy rate, currently at 3.35 per cent, is at its alltime low.", "We are not alone in this low policy rate environment.", "This being said, there IS hope, ladies and gentlemen!", "Amid the global uncertainty and the materiality of downside risks, the Mauritian economy has remained resilient.", "Mauritius stands as a buoyant jurisdiction and is progressively growing into a leading international financial centre.", "In today's unforgiving competitive environment, success is achievable only if the highest standards are maintained.", "On that front, I am blunt: There is NO compromise from our side!", "At the outset, let me reiterate that the Bank is pursuing its mission of preserving monetary and financial stability, whilst supporting Mauritius' transition towards becoming a digital economy.", "Ladies and gentlemen, as a prelude to the second part of my speech, allow me to set a few elements in perspective... First, inflation.", "It reached a low of 0.7 per cent in October 2019 and is expected to remain below 1 per cent in the coming months, before rising to an estimated 1.5 per cent in 2020.", "Second,
