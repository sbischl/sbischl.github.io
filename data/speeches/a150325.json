most precise of business projections or the most efficient of credit appraisals to foresee these problems.", "It would be irrational on part of either the supervisor or the banker to cast aspersions on the intent of the borrowers in such cases.", "However, it is important in such cases that the bankers as well the borrowers do admit the problem at the earliest and initiate measures to revive the account including infusion of new equity, sanction of new debt, induction of new promoters etc.", "Restructuring of problem accounts is a perfectly genuine banking tool and must be used if in the

responsibilities, co-operate with lenders and adhere to a general code of conduct and discipline.", "The minimum one can do is to adhere to the loan agreements.", "Use of judicial channels should not
