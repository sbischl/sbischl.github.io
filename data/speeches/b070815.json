Rato, Managing Director of the IMF, and Mr. Herve\u0301 Hannoun, Deputy General Manager of the BIS, to share their views and insight on this issue.", "I believe that we can greatly benefit from the

certain that their perspectives will be useful in setting the tone for our further discussions on how to better prepare ourselves for the more intensified volatility of capital flows, which, I believe, have been rooted to our current economic environment.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Following our discussions on the theme, we will have Dr. Perry Warjiyo and Mr. Richard Murray, our Executive
