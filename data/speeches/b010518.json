to be established.", "Banking institutions must therefore allocate adequate resources to this strategic initiative.", "In the new financial landscape that is to come, it will become clear that only few will emerge to compete effectively and efficiently across all banking markets and to provide the full range of banking services.", "As such, bankers will be forced to re-examine existing business models to see where their strengths lie and to what opportunities these strengths can be applied to enhance returns.", "There may be advantage to move towards strategic differentiation among the banks

personalised and customised to the individual needs of corporate and retail clients.", "Banking institutions would therefore need to be more proactive and innovative in packaging and marketing their products.", "While customers will expect wider range of products to be offered, of greater importance is for the banking institutions to be able to provide these products at competitive pricing.", "As competition intensifies, banking institutions will have no option but to be more innovative in pricing which will result in further narrowing of margins.", "Banking institutions would also need to consider new business arrangements and approaches in order to enhance returns.", "One way this can be achieved is through strategic alliances, which is already widely practised by global players.", "Strategic alliances have become a viable strategy for banks contemplating new markets.", "Through these alliances, banks can complement their existing strengths with those of their partners' capabilities, distribution channels, and access to new markets.", "At the individual banking institution level, the ability to make real improvement would also depend very much on the availability of competent human resource.", "The quality of manpower will be a defining element of performance and competition among the banking institutions.", "Attracting the best skills and talents in the industry must also be complemented with better management and communication so that there is an awareness and understanding of visions and shared values throughout the organisation.", "Just as the change of management mindset is a key factor that is needed to embrace strategic change, changing employees' mindset becomes a key factor to building commitment towards the overall success of the organisation.", "Towards this end, training and development of employees must also be seen as a contributing factor towards value creation within the banking institutions rather than merely to comply with regulatory requirements or as a non-revenue function that is costly and unnecessary.", "Only with both competence and commitment from the organisation's workforce, and their continuing training and development, will real strategic change take place.", "To achieve our vision for a stronger banking system that is more effective and efficient, banking institutions will need to recognise the greater role of knowledge and ICT in the changing economic landscape.", "There are some clear benefits including increased convenience, increased access to information, speed of transactions, and enhanced control and management of personal finances.", "Banking institutions are therefore urged to explore and capture new opportunities offered by the advances in ICT.", "The new innovations will be an integral part of the financial landscape.", "A more logical response would perhaps be the full integration of high technology systems into the \"brick and mortar\" facilities that banking institutions already offer.", "With online technology, new levels of customer segmentation can be achieved.", "In this context, close coordination between the existing channels and the online channel

"Specifically, the adoption of best practices with regard to credit practices would be monitored, consistent with the requirement of the credit risk management guidelines to be issued by Bank Negara Malaysia.", "In such environment, the need to ensure adequate and effective consumer education and protection would also become even more crucial.", "The prevention of any disruptions in the level or reliability of services to bank customers and also their protection from potential unfair practices reflects favourably on the ability of the financial system to absorb increasing competition in such an environment.", "There needs to be active and structured consumer education programmes to increase consumer understanding of banking institutions' products and services, which will in turn give rise to more active consumerism.", "In pursuing this effort, Bank Negara Malaysia together with the banking institutions have established a working committee for the Consumer Education Programme in November last year.", "The working committee will facilitate and coordinate the launching of a Consumer Awareness Campaign nationwide.", "The objectives of this initiative are threefold, i.e.", "to educate and enhance consumer knowledge on personal financial issues; to improve legal protection for consumers and customer redress avenues; and to increase product transparency and disclosure.", "Working closely with the consumer associations, the committee aims to identify and clarify misleading information on products and services available to the banking public.", "In moving towards a standard full disclosure model for products, the committee will determine the minimum level of product transparency to ensure that consumers are clearly informed of all risks and liabilities associated with the product.", "In addition, a review of the current legal protection for consumers will be conducted to provide further assurance to the public that their rights will not be compromised.", "As part of this exercise, the committee intends to publish information leaflets and pamphlets on specific issues that have been raised by consumers.", "In the longer term, it is hoped that a more active consumerism would increase consumer pressure for market efficiency leading to more innovation by the banking institution.", "It will also entail greater market discipline among these institutions while increasing consumer buying power and reducing consumer complaints arising directly from ignorance.", "It is envisaged that all these factors will push the local banking institutions towards a higher level of professionalism and efficiency.", "In line with the on-going efforts to accord further protection to consumers, the \"Guideline for Lending Institutions Accepting Guarantee for a Credit Facility\" issued by Bank Negara Malaysia in 1995 is currently being reviewed.", "As an initial step, I am pleased to announce the waiver clause, which pertains to the ability of the prospective guarantor to voluntarily waive his rights under the guideline, will be removed.", "In addition, the threshold of credit facilities which are covered under the Guideline will now be increased from RM200,000 to RM250,000.", "Conclusion: Making it happen The financial sector masterplan has identified the building blocks for an effective and efficient financial system that will meet Malaysia's requirements as we advance forward into the next decade.", "The Plan has provided a shared vision, a common goal to be achieved over the next ten years.", "The various initiatives that are required to realise this vision form the building blocks.", "It needs to be recognised however, that the objectives that have been outlined cannot be achieved within a short period of time.", "It is an evolutionary process rather than a discontinuous process.", "The realisation of the vision however, involves initiatives to be taken now by the industry.", "Having the medium and longer term goals outlined provides a basis to ensure the short term initiatives will be consistent and coherent with the long term objective.", "In other words, the construction of the building blocks must move in the right direction and must begin now.", "As part of the process, each banking institution needs to formulate their own strategic plans and short-term action plans within this longer term perspective.", "While the foundations have been built and the plans are in place, the future is by no means secure.", "It is only with the combined efforts of all the stakeholders, especially the banking institutions themselves that the probability to scale these greater heights will be enhanced."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
