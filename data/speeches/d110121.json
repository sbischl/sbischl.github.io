regard, express our special appreciation to the private sector colleagues for their cooperation during the survey.", "Let me also take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to the Private Sector Development (PSD) Programme, for providing financial support for this very important project.", "Further, our thanks go to the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute (MEFMI), and

able to undertake this very important survey.", "Distinguished Participants, As you are aware, the Zambian economy has recorded significant positive developments in the recent past, owing to the

survey findings show that the concentration of foreign direct investment in the mining sector is reducing as evidenced by the substantial FDI inflows to other sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale

that will help enhance Zambia's favourable investment climate.", "Further, the results of the survey should prove useful to the private sector and other stakeholders as they highlight some concerns which Government should address as well as the overall business profitability and performance prospects of various sectors.", "The importance of timely and reliable information on capital flows in the design of appropriate policy responses by Government and thus enhancing macroeconomic stability can hardly be overemphasised.", "Adequate and consistent information on capital flows will also greatly improve Balance of Payments Statistics for Zambia and serve as an early warning system for Government on potential financial crises and other external shocks.", "Mr. Chairman, Zambia has adequate technical capacity to collect, analyse and disseminate data and information on foreign private investment.", "It has, however, lagged behind in terms of the frequency of these surveys compared with some other countries in the region.", "For instance, while we are now at the third phase of the Survey, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi are in their eighth, fifth and fourth phases, respectively.", "This only emphasises the critical need to conduct this enterprise survey more regularly.", "To this end, I wish to reiterate the Bank of Zambia's, continued support and commitment in working in close
