355 of them are mutual banks.", "Supervision of these banks is intensive; the supervisory review process is based on risk profile analysis methods consistent with European guidelines and on regular on-site inspections (roughly one hundred a year).", "The bank's overall functionality, its capital adequacy and its asset quality are assessed.", "Regarding asset quality in particular, inspections include a review of individual credit files to check that loans are correctly classified and the relative valuation adjustments are adequate.", "At the end of the annual evaluation, the capital ratios deemed adequate for each bank are established, taking the minimum requirement as a basis, and requests to strengthen capital are made where necessary.", "It is also thanks to this supervisory action that since the end of 2011 the highest quality capital ratio of the banks directly supervised by the Bank of Italy has increased from 11.8 to 15.5 per cent (against an increase from 8.8 to 11.7 per cent for 'significant' banks) and the coverage ratio for non-performing loans (NPLs) has risen from 28.2 to 43.6 per cent (against an increase from 40.6 to 45.6 per cent for 'significant' banks).", "The high level of NPLs, a weakness more typical of the Italian banking system than of others, is being assessed by market analysts as well.", "Some describe the phenomenon as still growing, others suggest that it is underestimated in publicly available data.", "Given the importance of the questions raised, they deserve satisfactory answers.", "In Italy, the deterioration in loan quality, aggravated above all by the long recession, recently came to a halt.", "The ratio of the stock of NPLs to outstanding loans began to diminish at the end of last year.", "In June this year it stood at 17.7 per cent including write-downs;

this should be taken into account in any overall assessment, although without disregarding the possible problems in recovering the collateral, especially in today's difficult market.", "Also worth noting is the significant difference between exposures classified as bad loans, for which there is actually no possibility of a 'cure', and other non-performing loans (those 'unlikely to pay' and past-due debts or credit-line breaches), in which the debtors may be facing temporary difficulties.", "Without underestimating the risks associated with the latter exposures, it should be borne in mind that proactive management by the banks may make positive cash flows possible and permit a return to normal conditions.", "As regards managing bad loans, in several cases we have found shortcomings in banks' organization and governance.", "These must be resolved so that the banks can take full advantage of the opportunities that have opened up following the recent enactment of new laws to shorten recovery procedure times, potentially bringing them closer to those in the other main countries.", "Banks are being encouraged to move in this direction by the guidelines on managing NPLs, recently provided for consultation by the ECB and addressed to 'significant' banks, and the new detailed survey of bad loans requested by the Bank of Italy, which is currently examining the early findings.", "The availability of systematic, detailed data will not only help to make the internal management of bad loans more efficient, but it will also encourage their sale on the market, where necessary, by ensuring more transparent information.", "It should nevertheless be noted that the majority of non-performing loans are held by banks that are healthy overall; because they do not need an immediate sale of bad loans, they can take advantage of generally higher recovery rates than current market prices imply.", "Moreover, incentives to reduce the ratio of NPLs to outstanding loans, which could have been done quickly had it been possible to set up, with public backing, a company to manage such assets, are now provided by the measures introduced by the Italian authorities over the last two years.", "These are designed to foster the development of a market for NPLs, in part by shortening the recovery process.", "In the near future, a large volume of bad loans could be sold or securitized, including through recourse to government guarantees for senior tranches.", "The timeline for this recovery process should not be cut too short, however.", "The risks that could arise along the way will be smaller, the more efficient are economic policies in supporting the recovery."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Non-performing loans (NPLs)", "Bank supervision", "Asset quality", "Bank restructuring", "Bank capital", "Bank resolution", "Bank governance", "Market for NPLs", "Economic policies", "Recovery process"]}
