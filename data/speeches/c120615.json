the risk of instability emanating from the repo market.", "At the international level, the Financial Stability Board is currently assessing potential reforms of repo markets and for loans of

counterparties.", "Another promising avenue addresses the regulation of margins to mitigate the problems associated with procyclicality.", "Adopting minimal, or countercyclical, margins could help to
