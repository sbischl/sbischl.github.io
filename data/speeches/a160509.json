member countries have strengthened their national budgetary processes and institutions; and a surveillance mechanism has been set up for early detection and correction of macroeconomic imbalances.", "Finally, the European Stability Mechanism was established.", "Second, tightening regulatory standards on sovereign exposures can hardly be sufficient to safeguard banks against their domestic sovereign default.", "Direct exposures are just one of the channels that transmit sovereign risk to the domestic banking system.", "Sovereign defaults are associated with severe economic crises, which have a widespread negative impact on domestic banks quite independently from the degree of their direct exposure.", "Third, preventing an excessive concentration of risks may be desirable in principle.", "However, the historical experience shows that in a \"normal\" economic environment EU banks autonomously reduced their sovereign portfolios (as well as the concentration) without any need for regulatory nudges (Fig.", "Indeed, the evidence suggests that most EU countries' sovereign holdings behaved counter-cyclically: they declined during the \"normal period\" between the introduction of the euro and the beginning of the financial crisis; increased during the crisis period; and started once more to decline in the last two years, as the crisis began to subside (see the cases of Italy - Fig.", "This pattern suggests that regulation is not an important driver of banks' exposures towards their own sovereign: throughout this entire period, the prudential treatment of sovereign exposures remained broadly unchanged.", "It also indicates that high sovereign exposures are a symptom and a consequence, rather than a driver, of the crisis.", "Fourth, whereas in \"normal\" times banks' sovereign exposures declined spontaneously, the imposition of risk weights or - worse - tight concentration limits could create substantive difficulties in \"crisis\" times.", "They could be particularly disruptive for banks' ability to act as shock absorbers in the event of sovereign stress.", "There is evidence that sovereign debt markets are prone to self-fulfilling crises: if investors believe a sovereign faces fiscal problems, required yields will be higher, which can exacerbate, or even create, the fiscal problems.", "Probably the clearest recent example of this pattern is the surge in \"redenomination risk\" in the euro area, connected with undue fears of a break-up of the Monetary Union.", "To the extent that banks act as contrarian investors (selling assets when markets overheat and buying when they are excessively bearish), purchases of sovereign debt when the sovereign experiences difficulties notwithstanding relatively solid economic fundamentals are actually beneficial to financial stability.", "There is clear evidence that domestic investors played such contrarian role during the EU sovereign debt crisis, buying sovereign bonds as foreign investors were fleeing (Fig.", "2 again for the Italian case; similar patterns have been documented for Spain).", "Imposing risk weights or setting large exposure limits on domestic sovereign exposures would impair this shock-absorption ability.", "Exposure limits, in particular, could act as a coordinating device for speculative attacks.", "Since a change in banking regulation would likely herald a similar change in other parts of the financial system (most notably the insurance sector), the entire domestic financial sector could be affected.", "Finally, a system which differentiates the risk weights according to the sovereign's credit risk could end up relying upon ratings issued by the Credit Rating Agencies (CRA).", "Even advocates of a change in the prudential treatment of sovereign exposures admit that credit ratings of sovereigns have serious shortcomings.", "In particular, they tend to be backwardlooking and to foster herd behaviour.", "As such, they could exacerbate pro-cyclicality and ultimately increase financial instability risk.", "Overall, I believe that today, as 30 years ago, the mere recognition that there is no truly riskfree asset does not per se warrant a change in the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures.", "I doubt that further changes in prudential regulation are the right instrument for addressing the sovereign- bank nexus, taking into account that sovereign risk should first and foremost be addressed by strengthening the sustainability of public finances.", "In this regard, while member states should attain sound fiscal positions so as to make their sovereign paper safer, enhancing economic growth represents the most important factor for putting the public finances on a sustainable path.", "This is clearly shown by the example of Italy, where the debt to GDP ratio has risen by 33 percentage points since 2007.", "Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if Italian nominal GDP had since grown at a similar rate as in the previous ten years, the debt to GDP ratio would now be just 3 points, and not 33 points, higher than in 2007 (actually, it would be slightly below the 2007 level, once the financial support to other European countries is taken into account).", "This suggests that efforts to rebalance the public finances must be part and parcel of an economic policy designed to create the conditions for robust and lasting growth.", "I also believe that any reform proposal should be based on a comprehensive approach, avoiding partial equilibrium analyses and capturing all the relevant effects; also, it should be evaluated by focusing on potential benefits and costs in a financial stability perspective, taking into account potential unintended consequences.", "Considering the pervasive role played by sovereign bonds in modern economies, these can arise in various sectors, well beyond banking.", "To this end, a deep understanding is needed of: the extension and potential effect of any reallocation of bank sovereign exposures across banks; the interactions with other rules of the Basel framework, including in particular the rules on liquidity; the impact of changes in regulation on the provision of loans to the broader economy; the consequences for monetary policy;
