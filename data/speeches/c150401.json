still the main trading partner currency - strengthen as a result of North Sea Oil and the anti-inflation policies of the Thatcher Government, but the ERM itself failed to live up to its branding as a zone of monetary stability.", "In particular, with its many realignments, the ERM lacked a \"nominal anchor\" which would ensure price stability.", "This allowed less disciplined member states frequent opportunities to offset wage competitiveness drift with adjustments to the peg.", "Devaluations of the Irish pound against the DM -

as could macroprudential policies.", "The creation of a sovereign wealth fund (the National Pension Reserve Fund) can be thought of as a step in this direction, though the annual 1 per cent of GDP contribution to it did not take enough spending power out of the economy.", "Personal savings were also incentivised by a remarkably generous special savings scheme introduced in 2001, but this scheme disgorged the savings five years later, with the economy still in its boom phase.", "And fiscal incentives for the already over-dimensioned construction sector continued for far too long.", "While the overall headline figures for the Government's finances showed a comfortable position, and the debt ratio fell to 25 per cent of GDP, stable sources of revenue had been displaced by volatile ones, and large expenditure commitments were undertaken making the future evolution of the public finances over-dependent on a continuation of the housing boom.", "Getting the public finances back on track after the collapse of the property boom would have been painful enough, but the added borrowing resulting from the bank failures (and from the assumption by Government of banking debts) was the straw that broke the camel's back, triggering a loss of access to international financial markets as awareness grew of the scale of the losses.", "Quick action to negotiate a programme of financial assistance from the IMF, and from official EU lenders, stabilised the situation and eventually enabled the Government to finance much of the additional borrowing on favourable terms.", "The very fact that the most significant banking failures outside of Ireland in this crisis occurred in non-euro area countries (Iceland, Latvia, the UK, the US) does help to emphasise that the Irish crisis was not a creation of the euro area.", "True, there were major banking failures in euro area countries too, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France and so on.", "Banking excesses were essentially a global phenomenon in the first decade of the 2000s.", "Yes, Irish banks probably found it that bit easier to access foreign funds when no account needed to be taken of exchange rate risk.", "But Iceland's banks also sourced international funds without much difficulty.", "In the past, exchange rate regimes did not come complete with specific external supervision of domestic policies.", "To be sure, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has conducted surveillance of its members' fiscal policies for decades, regardless of their exchange rate regime.", "Ireland's peg to sterling was of course not accompanied by banking supervision conducted by the Bank of England.", "Nor did the European Monetary System have a banking supervision arm.", "And that was the decision also when the euro area was established: creation of something like what has now been established as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) would have been seen as a step too far by anti-federalists.", "Still, in its enthusiasm for forging an understanding of the euro area as the most relevant policy unit for its actions, the ECB may have gone too far in the other direction of failing to appreciate the dangers posed by intra-euro area capital flows, especially through the banking system.", "The IMF did not foresee the Irish banking meltdown, and this realisation may induce some scepticism about the ability of external surveillance to prevent such problems.", "However, the SSM's analysis and engagement is much more intense, and it has the full powers of a modern banking regulator.", "Fluctuations in sterling also contributed to overall economic performance in Ireland during the financial crisis.", "Sterling weakened sharply in 2007-2008 pushing the bilateral nominal exchange rate for Ireland vis-a\u0300-vis the UK to all-time record levels (Figure 7).", "This surge was largely maintained during the worst of the crisis, though it has since fallen back -
