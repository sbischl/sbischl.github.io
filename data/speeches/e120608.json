experiences, as opposed to goods - we can see this is a significant change for the retail sector.", "No doubt reinforcing this trend towards more circumspect, but more typical, behaviour is that the earlier strong upward trend in real assets per head has abated over recent years.", "In fact, real household assets per head today are about the same as they were five years ago, with a dip during the crisis, a subsequent partial recovery and then a slow drift down over the past couple of years.", "Both dwelling prices and share prices -

persistent strong increases in asset values, very strong growth in per capita consumption, increasing leverage, little or no saving from current income - were to re-emerge any time soon.", "That is, the gap between consumption today and the old trend level on the chart is not going to close.", "I noted to another audience about three years ago that the prominence of household demand in driving growth in the 1990s and 2000s was unlikely to be repeated.", "If there were business strategies that assumed a resumption of the earlier trend, they will surely be disappointed in time, if they have not been already.", "There were several parts of the economy that benefited from that earlier period, and that are finding the going much tougher now.", "Retailing was obviously one, but so was banking.", "Banks and other financial institutions enjoyed rapid balance sheet and profit expansion as they lent to households and some businesses.", "But they can see that period has now finished.", "Businesses that serviced rapid turnover in the dwelling stock (such as real estate agents, mortgage brokers) are seeing those revenue streams considerably reduced, and are having to adjust their strategies and capacity to suit changed conditions.", "For example, the rate of dwelling turnover is about one-third less than it was on average over the previous decade, and about half its peak levels.", "This is affecting state government stamp duty collections as well as the real estate sector.", "We can also see some echoes of these changing trends in household demand in business investment spending.", "This chart shows business investment, split into mining and non-mining, and measured in real, per capita terms, so as to be consistent with the earlier charts (Graph 4).", "Investment has been on a stronger upward trend since the mid-1990s than it had been for a number of years before that.", "In particular, business investment in real per capita terms has grown, on average, by over 6 per cent per annum since 1995, more than double the average pace over the preceding 35 years.", "Moreover a lot of this was in the non-mining sector, and it began before the present run up in mining investment really got going.", "Some of this growth reflected the same \"consumer facing\" growth sectors mentioned above.", "Of the four sectors that had the fastest growing investment spending over that period, three were finance, one called \"rental hiring and real estate services\", and retail trade.", "Some of these sectors are slowing their investment rates now.", "Meanwhile, mining investment has recently been rising at an extraordinary pace.", "In 2005, mining investment was near its long-run average of around 2 per cent of GDP.", "By mid-2014 we expect it to reach at least 9 per cent of GDP.", "If that occurs, mining investment will be about as large as business investment in the rest of the private economy combined.", "As a result of that, total business investment will reach new highs this year, and next.", "Hence there is a very large build-up in the nation's capital stock occurring.", "If it is well managed and soundly based, that ought to allow the possibility of further growth in output and incomes.", "The investment phase of the mining boom will start to tail off in a couple of years' time, after which the shipments of natural resources should step up significantly.", "We might expect by then as well that some other areas of investment spending that are weak at present will be picking up.", "More generally, I suspect we will discuss the nature of investment quite a bit in coming years as we grapple with structural change in the economy and powerful shifts in the population's needs (think of investment in the aged-care sector, for example, or public infrastructure needs).", "We will also be looking for productivity pay-offs from the various investments.", "But the key message for today is that the multi-speed economy is not just about the mining sector squeezing other sectors by drawing away labour and capital and pushing up the exchange rate.", "It is doing that, but slower growth in sectors that had earlier done well from unusually strong gains in household spending would have been occurring anyway, even if the mining boom had never come along.", "It is these changes in behaviour by households, in asset markets and in credit demand, that I think lie behind much of the disquiet - dissatisfaction even - that so many seem to have been expressing.", "But this would, as I say, have occurred with or without the mining boom.", "In fact, without the mining boom and its spillovers, we would have been feeling the effects of those adjustments rather more acutely than we do now.", "The period of household gearing up could have ended in a much less benign way.", "Implications for policy What are the implications of these trends for economic policy, and particularly monetary policy?", "Does it have a role in helping the adjustment?", "One thing we should not do, in my judgement, is to try to engineer a return to the boom.", "Many people say that we need more \"confidence\" in the economy among both households and businesses.", "We do, but it has to be the right sort of confidence.", "The kind of confidence based on nothing more than expectations of ever-increasing housing prices, with the associated willingness to continue increasing leverage, on the assumption that this is a sure way to wealth, would not be the right kind.", "Unfortunately, we have been rather too prone to that misplaced optimism on occasion.", "You don't have to be a believer in bubbles to think that a return to sizeable price increases and higher household gearing from still reasonably high current levels would be a risky approach.", "It would surely be a false basis for confidence.", "The intended effect of recent policy actions is certainly not to pump up speculative demand for assets.", "As it happens, our judgement is that the risk of re-igniting a boom in borrowing and prices is not very high, and this was a key consideration in decisions to lower interest rates over the past eight months.", "Hence, I do not think we should set monetary policy to foster a renewed gearing up by households.", "We can help, at the margin, the process of borrowers getting their balance sheets into better shape.", "To the extent that softer demand conditions have resulted from households or some businesses restraining spending in an effort to get debt down, and this leads to lower inflation, our inflation targeting framework tells us to ease monetary policy.", "That is what we have been doing.", "The reduction in interest rates over the past eight months or so - 125 basis points on the cash rate and something less than that, but still quite a significant fall, in the structure of intermediaries' lending rates - will speed up, at the margin, the process of deleveraging for those who need or want to undertake it.", "In saying that, of course, we cannot neglect the interests of those who live off the return from their savings and who rightly expect us to preserve the real value of those savings.", "Popular discussion of interest rates routinely ignores this element, focusing almost exclusively on the minority of the population -

the one where it is most relevant.", "What monetary policy cannot do is make the broader pressures for structural adjustment go away.", "Not only are the consumption boom and the household borrowing boom not coming back, but the industry and geographical shifts in the drivers of growth cannot be much affected by monetary policy.", "To a large extent, they reflect changes in the world economy, which monetary policy cannot influence.", "Even if, as a society, we wanted to resist the implications of those changes other tools would be needed.", "In fact Australia does better to accommodate these changes, and to think about what other policies might make adjustment less difficult and quicker for those adversely affected.", "It is in this area, in fact, that we need more confidence: confidence in our capacity to respond to changed circumstances, to respond to new opportunities, and to produce goods and services which meet market demands.", "It is also to be hoped that some of the recent positive data outcomes will give pause to reflect that, actually, things have so far turned out not too badly.", "We face a remarkable period in history.", "The centre of gravity of the world economy seems to be shifting eastwards -
