on the production side, and a faster pick up in investment - on the expenditure side.", "We expect such movements to continue in the period ahead, given that favourable conditions at home support growth in investment and exports and, by extension, higher employment and living standard of citizens.", "Most importantly, the results achieved are long-term and lasting.", "For five years in a row, inflation has been low, stable, predictable and comparable to that in European countries, and the NBS is trusted that inflation will remain low in the future as well.", "What we consider our most important result is that low inflation has become a normality in Serbia, which means that we have succeeded in achieving our primary objective, mandated by law.", "Not so long ago, in the autumn of 2012, year-on-year inflation measured 12.9%.", "In less than one year we brought it down to 2.2% and preserved it at an average of 2.0% in the next five years.", "Since that time inflation in Serbia hovered at a level recorded in European countries, equalling 2.4% in July.", "The intention to maintain, in the period to come, what has been achieved is also affirmed by our decision to lower the inflation target from 4\u00b11.5% to 3\u00b11.5% as of the beginning of 2017.", "Low inflationary pressures reflected primarily adequate monetary policy measures that were fully coordinated with fiscal policy, and this was also at the core of anchoring inflation expectations.", "Today the financial and corporate sectors expect inflation to be maintained at a low level, as they have done for almost five years, since this brings certainty to their business and planning.", "Chart 1 Low and stable inflation Chart 2 Anchored one-year ahead inflation expectations (y-o-y rates, in %) (y-o-y rates, in %) July 2018.", "Sources: Gallup, Ipsos/Ninamedia, Bloomberg and NBS.", "Relative stability of the dinar exchange rate has been preserved and the country's foreign exchange reserves have increased.", "In the last six years we have also maintained relative stability of the exchange rate -
