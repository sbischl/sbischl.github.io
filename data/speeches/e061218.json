the Caballero view17.", "Calvo view: soft landing in the US and sudden stops in some emerging markets \u2022 if EM central banks stop buying dollars and UST, they will at the same time stop issuing bonds in domestic currencies which are used to sterilize money markets.", "It will not imply a change in total world debt level, but a change in the total world debt composition.", "If bonds are highly substitutable (as might be in the case of UST and JGB) then if Japan were to stop buying US debt instruments the effect on US rates would be minimal.", "PBoC cannot stop buying foreign debt instruments as it would imply very big appreciation of renminbi, it can change the currency structure of its reserve holdings.", "This would force a change in composition of debt in hands of private investors and the impact on US rate would be small again.", "\u2022 in the scenario of rapid adjustment of US current account deficit, for example following sizeable Asian currencies appreciation, current account surpluses in EM would have to correct massively, some countries may find that their current account surpluses are smaller than debt amortizations, and history shows that in 18 percent of cases sudden stops in emerging markets took place under current account surpluses.", "Calvo view implies very low risk of US long term rates going up (high likelihood of soft landing, low likelihood of hard landing), and relatively high risk of some emerging markets experiencing sharp current account reversals and possibly sudden stops.", "Calvo view is reinforced in the recent paper by Faruqee, Laxton, Muir, Presenti (2006)18, which shows that even when a new wave of protectionism hits the global economy, the US growth will slow only marginally by 0.2 percent, while impact on Asia could be sizeable, reducing growth by more than 1 percent.", "Caballero view: bubbles are inevitable and possibly long-lasting in economy facing asset \u2022 there has been significant increase in global savings relative to investments (you can merge Bernanke global savings glut with IMF global investment drought hypotheses here) this excess saving is chasing too few available financial assets, which leads to very high valuations (rising equity indices, low long-term rates, low corporate and EM spreads etc.)", "problem lies in the underdevelopment of financial markets in emerging economies, which due to poor governance and property rights do not have enough good quality collateral to back debt obligations.", "These economies have also many other macroeconomic and microeconomic deficiencies leading to asset shortages and reduction of value of existing assets such as: weak bankruptcy procedures, chronic macroeconomic volatility and sheer appropriation risk.", "As PIMCO Michael Gomez puts it in September emerging markets note titled \"Is it safe?", "\"19: \"EM has historically been vulnerable to deteriorating economic and financial conditions in the United States and other developed countries.", "Slower growth, tighter liquidity, and heightened risk aversion in mature markets generally mean lower commodity prices, less capital flows, and higher interest rates for EM borrowers - conditions that helped produce some spectacular financial crises in the past dozen years.", "Not a pretty picture, and one that begs the question of what lies around the corner\".", "However, if asset shortages story is correct, then upcoming US slowdown (or brief recession according to some non-consensual forecasts) would likely further increase excess saving (as fading growth prospects will discourage investment projects and encourage more private saving amid rising uncertainty, only partly offset by higher public dissaving due to automatic stabilizers), and lower valuation of US equities will make the world supply of assets even more scarce.", "In such situation US economy having hard times may not necessarily lead to higher risk premia for emerging markets (as it was the case in the past) rather any increase in risk premia would be used by investors to enhance returns, spread compression will continue, and yield curve inversion may even deepen on major markets, and knock the door in some emerging markets20.", "PIMCO seems to subscribe to this possibility, although they do not use asset shortage argument, but \"Local markets investments may provide the greatest divergence of returns within the EM universe, with those \"developing\" economies furthest along the road to \"developed\" market status able to enact traditional policy prescriptions in a slowing global economy and therefore providing enhanced return potential to local fixed-income instruments\".", "As a central banker in emerging market economy well advanced on the road to developed status I ask myself a question which view of the world is correct, because it may have different implications for growth and inflation prospects.", "Should we expect slowing external demand combined with local currency strength or combined with a local currency weakness.", "These are important questions (even in the context of falling exchange rate pass-through) which will be empirically answered next year.", "Today we can think only in balance of risks terms.", "Evidence in the last few months, including December BIS report21 shows, that official institutions may have accelerated their attempts to diversify reserve assets, which may mean more demand for high-yielding assets and for non-core currencies, and in particular for emerging market currencies (recall Government of Singapore Investment Corporation statement that emerging market weight in their assets under management will be increased, recall a number of hints given by oil exporting nations, or recall the statements given by Chinese authorities that the central bank should be more open-minded about cooperating with the government institutions in managing huge reserve assets).", "So, ceteris paribus, this factor will imply balance of risks skewed towards further risk premia compression in emerging markets in situation when US growth slows and expected returns in developed markets drop amid poor growth outlook.", "The important question is how it will end?", "Temporary US growth slowdown is unlikely to solve global imbalances issue, it is unlikely that oil-exporting countries will accelerate further their investment in real estate, as the pace is already frantic, lack of reforms in the eurozone indicates that potential output in this part of the world is unlikely to speed up significantly.", "So standard, consensus prescriptions will not work.", "The only feasible channel that might work is accelerating the pace of financial sector development, particularly in emerging markets, to produce more financial assets and more collateral.", "These reforms are easier to implement, because they do not require taking away social benefits and they do not hit any specific groups of interests.", "So it appears that the discussion should shift away from overvaluation of renminbi, and from implications of pegging gulf currencies to the weakening dollar, towards ways of speeding up necessary financial markets reforms in saving-abundant countries.", "If these reforms gain speed, we may be able to solve global imbalances problem without much global pain.", "As a concerned central banker
