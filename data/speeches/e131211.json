and liberalisation would facilitate the development of more efficient and robust financial systems and that it would result in a more efficient allocation of financial resources across borders.", "While such financial liberalisation may indeed bring such wide ranging benefits, it also brings with it increased risks that needs to be effectively managed.", "It was for these reasons that Malaysia adopted a conscious effort to put in place the financial and economic pre-conditions so as to enable us to benefit from such financial reforms involving the deregulation and liberalisation of our financial system.", "Allow me to share our experience in pursuing this agenda.", "Following the Asian Financial Crisis, Malaysia embarked on strategies for an orderly development of the financial

in the banking sector was made in terms of capitalisation, risk management and governance practices, delivery channels and in human capital development in the industry.", "This paved the way for the interest rate reform to move to greater market orientation, thereby supporting a more efficient pricing of financial products and services.", "The more competitive environment that it generated also became an important driver of productivity gains, customer centricity and innovation in the financial system.", "Equally important, was the attention that was given to the development of a deep and vibrant domestic bond market as an alternative channel for the efficient raising of funds, particularly by the corporate sector.", "The development of the bond market has enabled better matching of

profile of institutions, but it also is the resolution authority in the event of failure of a financial institution.", "Underpinning the financial sector growth was also the development of a more robust surveillance, regulatory and supervisory framework.", "As the Malaysian financial system evolved to become more complex, sophisticated and diversified, the regulatory and supervisory approach

intervention actions in relation to financial intermediation activities that occur outside the banking system.", "Following the global financial crisis, such shadow banking systems have come under greater regulatory scrutiny.", "Specifically, regulators have been concerned with the scope that exists for non-bank financial institutions to perform financial intermediation activities in a way that replicates the systemic risks associated with banking activities, without being subjected to the same rigor of regulation and supervision that is applied to banks.", "In this recent decade, the strengthened institutional arrangements in Malaysia to promote financial stability have contributed towards addressing this important gap.", "They include the establishment of an oversight authority for credit cooperatives, and provisions for the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend temporary deposit insurance coverage to instruments of non-bank intermediaries that are similar in nature to deposits.", "Also important has been the significant strengthening of inter-agency coordination arrangements to address potential regulatory gaps.", "The new legislation has also improved

identified which could threaten financial stability.", "A Financial Stability Executive Committee chaired by the Governor, which includes the Treasury Secretary, heads of key regulatory authorities

rate regime at the very same moment that China did.", "It has provided Malaysia with greater flexibility to adjust to changing structural conditions in the region and the global economy.", "This has been reinforced by the progressive liberalisation of foreign exchange administration rules which have enhanced business competitiveness and facilitated larger volumes of trade and foreign direct investment flows.", "This has generated greater two way flows in the foreign exchange market and thus promoted orderly conditions in an environment of highly volatile capital flows.", "In the financial sector new licences and foreign equity interests in the banking and insurance sectors have now moved beyond the prescription of hard limits, to assessments based on the prudential and in the best interest of Malaysia criteria.", "In building a stable and resilient financial system, the Central Bank has accorded greater emphasis on financial inclusion.", "This has included enhancing access

the necessary financial knowledge to make informed decisions.", "Recognising that the development of the financial sector also depends on the availability of high quality and skilled talent, focus was accorded to the development of human capital through the introduction of institutional arrangements to provide comprehensive education and learning programmes for the financial services industry.",

specialist and leadership levels.", "These include the setting up of programmes and institutions such as the Financial Sector Talent Enrichment Programme, the ICLIF Leadership and Governance Centre

reforms, it has every potential to emerge stronger and to continue its economic success that is now a well recognised milestone of this century and for the years to come."], "classifications":
