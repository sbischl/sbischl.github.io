it is difficult to estimate the exact contribution of the real estate sector to gross domestic product (GDP) as it appears in a disaggregated and dispersed form in the National Accounts Statistics, in view of what is stated above, lot of importance has been placed on the development of real estate in the country by the Government.", "Finance to real estate 3.", "Real estate and Housing sectors are unique in one respect.", "It is in these sectors the financing thereof is contributed by every possible source - be in the central government, the state governments, banks, NBFCs, HFCs, MFIs, private capital - formal or informal, or individuals - has a hand in it; still it is insufficient, given the massive magnitude of the needs for housing and real estate sectors in the country.", "The Government of India has taken several important policy decisions over the years in the areas of affordable and low income housing.", "It has played an important role in ensuring that the affordability component merges well with the overall sectoral strategy.", "Two factors that have clearly emerged as key drivers in the Indian housing market are: (1) a wider group of stakeholders and a multiplicity

life and hopes for a brighter tomorrow.", "Other policymakers such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Housing Bank are also playing their part in promoting growth through housing.", "It is heartening to note that the housing finance sector, which was in its infancy just two decades back, is now a thriving and vibrant part of the overall financial sector, is well integrated with the other segments of the economy and is equipped to take on the challenge of extending access to formal housing finance system to the less privileged segments of the society.", "The housing finance market witnessed significant expansion in late 1990s and early 2000s with the entry of scheduled commercial banks in a big way.", "The housing loan portfolio of both SCBs and HFCs has grown significantly over the years due to supportive policies initiated by Government of India and RBI.", "On the one hand, fiscal concessions were provided by GoI (under sections 80 C and 24 of I.T.Act) while on the other hand, housing loans upto \u20b9 25 lakh given by SCBs were brought under Priority Sector Lending.", "NPAs being very low and supported by SARFAESI Act, has prompted the financial institutions to make available housing loans at competitively affordable and comparatively lower rates.", "Besides, GoI has also implemented Interest Subvention Schemes like 1% Interest Subsidy Scheme, Interest Subsidy Scheme for Housing the Urban Poor (ISHUP) and Rajiv AwasYojana (RAY), etc., in order to make housing loans affordable for the targeted segments.", "These measures have resulted in improving the demand for housing loans.", "Recently, RBI has carved out Residential Project loans out of the purview of Commercial Real Estate arena to boost financing of project loans for increasing the supply of housing stock.", "However, housing loans as a percentage of GDP in our country has remained quite low at around 9 per cent which is significantly lower than the levels achieved in most of the developed countries.", "Further, the housing shortage in the urban areas was estimated, as of 2012, at 18.78 million units while in rural areas it is estimated to be more than 40 million units.", "The situation is alarming with 95 per cent of the housing shortage pertaining to the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG) categories which do not seem to

opportunity for deeper penetration of this market.", "The housing market in India is influenced by both demand and supply side constraints.", "The growing middle class, income levels of the people,

also extended additional tax incentive on home loans under Sections 80 C and 24 of I.T.Act, to encourage people, especially the young, to own houses amongst others.", "Regulatory approach 12.", "Despite the significance of the real estate and the housing sectors for the economy as a whole, their contribution to and further potentials for economic growth, and their critical role in poverty alleviation, these sectors have been globally considered by regulators as volatile and prone to formation of asset bubbles, requiring special regulatory attention to protect the interest of lenders and even the borrowers.", "Many a financial crisis in the world has been caused by the excesses in these sectors.", "Most recent global economic and financial crisis of 2008-09 has also been caused by these excesses.", "Therefore the regulatory approach to these sectors has been highly sensitive.", "Reserve Bank's regulations have also been directed towards containing excessive/rapid flow of credit towards the sector, prescribing prudential norms for banks and NBFCs for lending towards real estate activities.", "However, India needs special attention and support for housing.", "Therefore, the policy approach has been so fine-tuned facilitating affordable housing for weaker sections and growth of the residential real estate sector.", "National Housing Bank's regulations for the Housing Finance Companies also follow similar approach.", "Banks and CRE & housing 14.", "CRE and Housing finance as a financial service is relatively young in India and has witnessed massive growth

DBOD.BP.BC.No./08.12.015/2009-10 dated September 9, 2009 on \"Guidelines on Classification of Exposures as Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Exposures\" prescribes that for an exposure to be classified as Income Producing Real Estate (IPRE) / Commercial Real Estate (CRE), the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the creation / acquisition of real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment would depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset.", "Additionally, the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case.", "The primary source of cash flow (i.e.", "more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security.", "This circular also states that it is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, as different classifications are driven by different considerations.", "In such cases, the exposure would be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the exposure is assigned.", "For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights applicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure.", "The rationale for such an approach is that, while at times certain classifications / categorizations could be driven by socio-economic considerations and may be aimed at encouraging flow of credit towards certain activities, these exposures should be subjected to appropriate risk management / prudential / capital adequacy norms so as to address the risk inherent in them.", "Similarly, if an exposure has sensitivity to more than one risk factor it should be subjected to the risk management framework applicable to all the relevant risk factors.", "In view of the volatility in prices of commercial real estate (CRE), higher risk weight and provisioning norms have been prescribed by us for the CRE Sector.", "We have prescribed differential Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio, risk weights and provisioning for individual housing loans in order to differentiate the risks involved in low value and high value home loans.", "In order to support the residential housing sector, we have carved out (vide circular dated June 21, 2013) a separate sub-sector out of CRE viz.", "CRE-RH (Commercial Real Estate - Residential Housing).", "The circular defines CRE-RH as below: CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders / developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment.", "Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate.", "However, integrated housing projects comprising of some commercial space (e.g.", "shopping complex, school, etc.)", "can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project.", "In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.", "Carving out of CRE-RH was done with the intention of providing regulatory support to lending towards residential housing projects by allowing lower provisioning and risk-weights.", "Apart from this, different slabs of LTV ratios, risk weights and provisioning have been prescribed to support housing loans for lower income groups while stressing the need for higher stake of home buyers in high cost houses.", "The LTV ratio - Risk weight matrix for housing loans as also CRE and standard assets provisioning for both Housing as also CREs are tabulated below: 20.", "The restructured housing loans should be risk weighted with an additional risk weight of 25%.", "In view of the higher risk associated with housing loans at teaser rates i.e.", "at comparatively lower rates of interest in the first few years, after which rates are reset at higher rates, we have prescribed higher standard asset provisioning on such loans at 2.00 per cent from December 2010.", "The provisioning on these assets would revert to 0.40 per cent after 1 year from the date on which the rates are reset at higher rates if the accounts remain \"standard\".", "We have also advised banks vide circular dated February 3, 2012 that they should not include stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges in the cost of the housing property they finance so that the effectiveness of LTV norms is not diluted.", "These charges overstate the realisable value of the property and consequently the margin stipulated gets diluted.", "In order to ensure adequate credit flow to infrastructure sector as also towards the affordable housing needs of the country, by encouraging banks to optimally utilize the long-term financing avenues already available to them to finance their lending to these sectors, the extant prudential guidelines on this issue have been reviewed with a view to minimize certain regulatory pre-emptions.", "RBI vide its circular dated July 15, 2014 allowed banks to issue long-term bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to (i) long term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (ii) affordable housing.", "The circular has defined lending to affordable housing as housing loans eligible under priority sector lending by the RBI and also housing loans to individuals upto \u20b9 50 lakhs for houses of values upto \u20b9 65 lakhs located in the six metropolitan centres viz.", "Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and

amount exceeding ten per cent of its owned fund.", "Since September 2011, deposit taking and non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of \u20b9 100 crores and above are required to furnish data on their exposure to real estate.", "While granting finance to housing / development projects, NBFCs also should stipulate as a part of the terms and conditions that the builder / developer / owner / company would disclose in the Pamphlets / Brochures / advertisements, etc., the name(s) of the entity to which the property is mortgaged and that they would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee entity for sale of flats / property, if required.", "The risk weight currently applicable to real estate exposures is 100 per cent.", "For loans guaranteed by Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH), NBFC-MFIs may assign zero risk weight for the guaranteed portion.", "v. Every non-deposit taking NBFC with asset size of \u20b9 100 crores and above shall disclose its exposure to real estate, both direct and indirect.", "Mere extension of date of commencement of commercial operation (DCCO) in the case of CRE projects would not be considered as restructuring, if the revised DCCO falls within the period of one year from the original DCCO and there is no change in other terms and conditions.", "Further, the general instructions with regard to prudential norms including exposure norms are also applicable to NBFCs' exposure to real estate.", "NBFCs - Real estate exposure 25.", "As on March 31, 2014, the real estate exposure of NBFCs registered with the Bank at around 4.1 per cent of the total assets of the sector is not significant as may be observed

the preceding year.", "The quantum of funds to be contributed by each SCB and the applicable interest rate are determined by the Reserve Bank of India depending upon the priority sector shortfall of the respective SCB.", "The funds are made available to NHB for a period of 7 years.", "A total amount of \u20b9 12,778 crore was received by the Bank under the Fund in the first five years, and was
