greater trust in public institutions; increased democratic participation in civic and social life; a more stable and efficient financial system.", "At the very least, awareness of the functions of key financial-policy institutions, such as central banks, seems important to build trust in the system and in the institutions themselves.", "In the case of central banks, the picture of their main functions appears sometimes to be blurred in the public's eyes; and where knowledge is limited or biased, trust in institutions may in turn be undermined.", "showed that people asked to pick what they perceive to be the tasks and objectives of the ECB from a list, often select topics that are unconnected to the ECB's mandate.", "Poor understanding Thanks to Daniela Marconi and colleagues for assistance in the preparation of this speech.", "'Financial education: From better personal finance to improved citizenship', Journal of Financial Literacy and Wellbeing, 1(1), 12-27. doi:10.1017/flw..7;
