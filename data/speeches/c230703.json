the Bank's renewed service will have the capability to offer longer hours.", "But we need to carefully weigh the benefits against the potential cost.", "These include the costs of opening systems for longer and implementing novel approaches to technology upgrades when the concept of 'out of hours' disappears.", "We also need to consider how it would affect other markets, established market conventions and monetary policy transmission.", "It will be essential to work closely with the private sector to assess how, and over what timescale, RTGS operating hours could be extended.", "Changes in hours and access could also support some of the more recent ideas around directly interlinking national payment systems.", "This would enable payments to be settled directly between two providers, further cutting down the transaction chain.", "Projects to interlink payment systems are gathering momentum around the globe, building on pioneering experiments through Project Nexus and IXB.", "In July, the CPMI in cooperation with the Indian G20 Presidency will host an event on interlinking arrangements.", "The existing projects have shown that interlinking is feasible on a technical level.",

CPMI is preparing an interim report for the G20 on this topic later in the year.", "While many of these initiatives are driven by the public sector, their benefits will only materialise if the private sector use them.", "And it is important that the private sector can shape them.", "The new Industry Taskforce on Payment System Interoperability and Extension, chaired by Ulrich Bindseil from the ECB, will provide a valuable forum to discuss and shape implementation and market practices.", "Cross-border data exchange and message standards Message standards are crucial to the continued evolution of payment services.", "Currently, the data-carrying capacity in payments messages can be limited by the network technology developed in the last century.", "When developing the message formats a generation ago, each local infrastructure focussed on delivering the best solution for their own market.", "Over time, the type and structure of information transmitted has diverged, both between jurisdictions and across infrastructures.", "And the amount of data has not increased to meet the demands of this data-hungry world.", "Adopting ISO20022 worldwide will be a gamechanger.", "It is a common, global, non-proprietary standard.", "And if widely adopted it can enable payments to include a much richer set of information (for example the purpose of the payment, tax information, and an address of the house being bought).", "That can improve efficiency: by helping process more payments without the need for manual intervention and harmonising data transmitted through international payment systems and ultimately avoid unnecessary delays and costs in the cross-border payment journey.", "ISO20022 can also support regulatory compliance and enhance financial crime and fraud detection.", "Banks worldwide spend over $200bn a year on financial crime compliance: enriched data is an important ingredient in getting this number to drop.", "ISO 20022 provides a common language for financial transactions that allows for richer and more structured data.", "However, making the most of it requires consistent adoption across jurisdictions and using it to transmit a wider set of information than legacy payment messages.", "Limited or inconsistent uptake could lead to fragmentation.", "There is no point for me to include a code for the purpose of my payment if my South African counterpart was using a different set of codes.", "To establish a basic level of consistency, the Joint Task Force of the CPMI and Payments Market Practice Group have consulted on harmonising requirements for enhancing cross- border payments.", "They received an excellent response and will be announcing the results in the autumn.", "Another important dimension is the harmonisation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).", "Almost two-thirds of the payment systems surveyed by CPMI[16] already offer APIs to their participants.", "In the UK, our renewed RTGS has this month enabled its first API, with a full-fledged suite of APIs due to be delivered next year.", "APIs make it easier for payment systems and their participants to exchange data.", "The number of potential applications is vast.", "But to deliver real benefits these potential use cases rely on harmonised API standards.", "The CPMI is convening an industry panel of API Experts (APEX) from private and public sectors, to develop recommendations on the strategic direction for the industry.", "The standardisation of messaging and APIs can enable quicker, cheaper and safer payments.", "But implementing the technical changes is only the first step.", "Common practices and usage guidelines are essential in helping financial institutions operate across borders.", "Importantly, the industry panel will not seek to add another competing standard.", "Rather, it will evaluate existing API standards and develop recommendations for harmonisation based on current practices.", "It will also seek to develop lasting global governance forums to evolve and update the standards.", "The Call for Participation[17] is closing at the end of this month and I would encourage all relevant parties to consider applying.", "Legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks Diverging approaches to regulation and supervision are a major source of friction in cross-border payments, and an area where I increasingly hear calls for change from the private sector.", "Differences in how banks and non-banks are supervised can create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.", "There are very good reasons why nations adopt differing approaches to financial institution supervision, data protection and financial crime prevention.", "Nevertheless, international guidance and recommendations provide a strong principles-based framework for collaboration and interoperability between jurisdictions.", "A key part of the existing international framework for combatting financial crime is The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations.", "To remain effective, they need to keep pace with market developments.", "Global adoption of ISO20022 standards also offers an opportunity to harness the benefits of improved data.", "FATF will consider these issues as part of its planned review of Recommendation 16 on wire transfers, to improve consistency and usability of message data, and enable more effective AML/CFT checks.", "It will also continue efforts to promote consistent implementation of the Travel Rule for virtual assets.", "The new FSB industry taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters, chaired by Carolyn Rogers from Bank of Canada, will help move the conversation forward in these areas.", "We hope to harness expert input from industry and provide guidance, working with national authorities and the international standard-setting bodies.", "Continued collaboration Improving the payments infrastructure will only be possible through successful collaboration.", "As policymakers and operators, we can improve the policies and core infrastructure to provide solid foundations for private innovation.", "The private sector needs to build on this to help deliver cheaper, faster, more transparent, and more accessible services to their customers.", "The new industry taskforces will play an important role.", "But this needs to be complemented by strong dialogue and actions in individual jurisdictions: exploring improvements to the domestic payment infrastructure, using the globally agreed frameworks.", "Firms will likely need to continue to invest in their payments technology to be ready for upgrades to payment systems: such as the move to ISO 20022.", "The industry taskforce on Payment System Interoperability and Extension are developing a handy checklist to support firms on this journey.", "And importantly, firms should consider how to make the most of these changes.", "ISO 20022 will make a big difference to cross-border payments: but it also offers a wealth of other opportunities, which the individual firms can benefit from.", "While the roadmap is a G20-led initiative, the targets are international, and our goal is to improve payments across all countries and payment corridors.", "Making progress therefore depends on sharing best practice widely and achieving change worldwide.", "To that end, the World Bank and IMF, along with the G20 Central Banks, are developing a technical assistance programme available to countries wishing to enhance their national payments infrastructure or policies.", "We have achieved a lot already but there is still more to do, and much more to gain.", "We have built the foundations and a framework to support a holistic set of changes.", "Now we need to act and there is a role for everyone.", "I look forward to helping to smooth the path ahead in my role as a policymaker and a payment system operator.", "I hope that many of you will join and play your part in this exciting and transformational journey towards the shared vision that benefits companies, individuals and whole economies through enhanced cross-border payments.", "I would like to thank Andrei Pustelnikov, Paul Bedford, Anna Koch and Mark Streather for their help in preparing these remarks.", "See Building blocks for a roadmap to enhance cross-border payments: letter to the G20 2.", "See Enhancing
