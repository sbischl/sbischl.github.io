requirement of disaggregated granular banking data on a more frequent basis for policy and research has increased.", "For example, we have been compiling account level data on deposit, credit and interest rates on an annual basis through Basic Statistical Returns (BSRs).", "These data are an important source for understanding monetary transmission.", "Hence, there is a need to obtain these data on a higher frequency, at least on a quarterly basis, electronically from the banks' source systems.", "Moreover, data on similar items obtained through various statistical returns show significant differences.", "Hence, there is need to harmonise data definition across various returns submitted to different departments of the Bank.", "This will require a close coordination between
