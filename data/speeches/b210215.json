of Canada has announced its intention to give the Bank of Canada further oversight authority for retail payment service providers- aren't traditional banks companies that but specialize in processing payments for the public.", "By ensuring that risks are well managed, the Bank, through its new supervisory role, will support confidence in payment service providers and should further encourage competition and innovation in retail payments.", "The second development is open banking, which will remove the barriers for banking customers to safely and easily share their financial information if they choose to engage other service providers in managing their money and other assets.", "Open banking will help promote greater competition and choice by allowing consumers and businesses to more

rely on family members abroad to send them money so they can afford basic necessities such as food, clothing and education.", "Many of these needs have become more acute with the uneven global impact of the pandemic.", "Put simply, the problems with sending money across borders create disadvantages that can prevent already impoverished people and countries from fully participating in the global economy.", "In fact, these issues have been used as an argument for the creation and use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.", "But there is plenty of room to improve crossborder payments without using these novel methods of payment, which would not by themselves fix the problems with cross-border payments.", "As part of an initiative endorsed by the G20 and coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, the Bank of Canada and other central banks and regulators have developed a roadmap to solve some of these problems.", "Our main goal is to support faster and cheaper cross-border payments that are more accessible and transparent.", "As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech today, we have identified numerous pain points in cross-border payments.", "Technological shortcomings certainly pose problems with different messaging standards in different countries.", "Anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulations-while crucial for our safety and security-can
