about a third - as they did 20 years ago.", "Probably what is happening here is that China has displaced other Asian countries to some extent as a source of finished products, including by becoming the final point of assembly for many manufactured items constructed from components sourced all over Asia.", "Even more interesting is the fact that the United States sells a higher share of its exports to China than to any other single nation apart from Canada and Mexico, its two North American Free Trade Agreement partners.", "All these trends will surely continue, for the process of integrating China and India into the global economy has a good way to run yet.", "The Chinese Government is seeking growth of 7 per cent per annum over the coming five years.", "That would be a lower outcome than we have seen in the past five years, but is still very strong by the standards of the advanced countries.", "Growth at that sort of pace, on average, would see China's weight in global GDP exceed that of the euro area within five years and approach that of the United States within a decade.", "Of course, the future will not be that deterministic.", "The Chinese economy will have cycles; it will not trace out a path of steady, uninterrupted expansion.", "China could not expect to be immune from various other afflictions experienced by all countries that can occasionally impede economic growth.", "But by any reckoning, the emergence of China is a huge historical event.", "And then there is India.", "So the world of production and consumption is changing.", "But it must also follow that the world of finance is changing as well.", "As incomes rise so there is an accumulation of physical capital (which accommodates further increases in labour productivity and incomes) funded by saving out of current income.", "Moreover, the scale, scope and sophistication of financial activity increases, which typically sees the size of gross financial claims rise faster than income.", "The fact that Asian countries have traditionally seen quite high rates of private saving accentuates this trend.", "China's saving rate, at about 55 per cent of GDP, is one of the highest recorded and because China has become a large economy, the extent of that annual flow of saving is now globally very significant.", "In absolute terms, according to the available national income statistics, China is in fact now the world's largest saver.", "Its gross national saving, at an estimated US$3.2 trillion, exceeded that of both the United States and the euro area in 2010.2 Its gross investment is also the world's largest -

the weight of financial assets is also shifting.", "Now this is a slower process since the stock of wealth is a result of a long accretion over time and economies that rapidly become large in production terms may have a smaller stock of wealth than countries that have been similarly large for a long time -

as they do at present.", "At the moment we see a US recovery that is gaining some traction after a lengthy period of weakness, a subdued experience in Europe overall with intraregional differences probably at their most extreme since the euro commenced, while China and India are seeking to slow their expansions in the face of clear evidence of rising inflation.", "US banks are well ahead of their European counterparts in cleaning up their problems, to the extent that the government capital injections of two years ago are being repaid, while markets are still waiting for more complete information about the state of balance sheets in Europe and worrying about the feedback to public sector finances.", "Asia's banks, meanwhile, did not have a solvency crisis and have been able to perform their task of supporting growth.", "If anything, their problems are more likely to be those of exuberance.", "More attention is being paid to the US fiscal position - and that will probably increase further.", "In Asia, public finances are generally strong except in Japan.", "These differences were bound to increase the focus on policy differences between regions, and exchange rate systems in particular.", "It is not surprising that we are returning to discussion of the \"global imbalances\", since many of the underlying factors behind them have not gone away.", "Renewed efforts to find a framework for talking about these issues are now under way.", "As others have said, a prerequisite for a solution is a shared understanding of the problems within an agreed intellectual framework.", "But finding that combination is not proving easy.", "The dialogue needs to occur on multiple issues, to which countries bring different perspectives.", "Many of the countries of Asia come, for example, with a mindset in which the international monetary system is a device for stability, one of the foundations for strategies to grow economies and increase wealth.", "They see flows of capital, and fluctuations in exchange rates, as potentially disruptive to the real sectors of their economies.", "This is in many respects a traditional post-war perspective, when there was a US dollar standard, when the United States as an economic and financial power was unrivalled and all other economies and financial systems were truly small.", "But of course Asia is no longer small.", "Countries like the United States or Australia, on the other hand, have a different frame of reference.", "They tend to see the international monetary system as a device for accommodating shocks and reflecting differences in economic circumstances.", "They see price movements and capital flows, generally, as helping resource allocation.", "European countries share that perspective as far as flows and exchange rates between the major regions of the world are concerned, but share Asian perspectives on the need for stability within their own region.", "There are good reasons, in logic and history, for all these perspectives.", "We need to understand them, and find an accommodation.", "It does not help, in my judgment, that so much of the discussion takes place through a bi-lateral prism - particularly the US-China current account prism.", "Twenty years ago the prism was the US-Japan balance.", "The issues are multi-lateral, not bi-lateral.", "The US trade deficit was pretty widely spread for many years.", "It wasn't just with China.", "Over the past decade, the United States had a trade deficit with 13 of the 18 other countries in the G-20 (of the five surplus positions, the largest was with Australia).", "This bi-lateral focus can be quite troubling, and not only because it risks over-simplifying problems and therefore lessening the likelihood of solutions.", "It can be troubling for a host of small countries, which worry about the potential for more widespread effects of solutions that may be attempted.", "This is why it is so important that the problems be considered, and resolved, in a multi-lateral setting.", "Hence the importance of the international financial institutions, and of fora like the G-20, in providing the table around which these discussions should take place.", "That of course means that the legitimacy of those institutions, in the eyes of all their stakeholders, is key.", "Good progress has been made in improving the governance of bodies such as the IMF and no doubt more will be done in this area over the years ahead.", "The G-20, a body with a broader constituency than the G7, has taken a more prominent role.", "This is all good, but will need to be accompanied by ongoing efforts to reach a shared vision of the role of the institutions and the system they are supposed to watch over and protect.", "If we are all still not talking the same language about the role of the system or the institutions, then we will not collectively get very far.", "So much work needs to be done yet.", "America - still the world's dominant single economy and financial power, albeit not as dominant as it was - is critical to reaching the necessary framework.", "But so too is Asia - a fast-growing, high-saving region with increasing financial resources, a much increased part of the global economy and financial system, and with, therefore, commensurately increased responsibilities.", "Australia -
