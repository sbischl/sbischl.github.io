potential is the high level of trust and strong confidence of the economic agents to the government and policy makers We believe that the results of the Tax Amnesty program is unlikely to be

The second potential that has surfaced and deserves special note in 2016 is the emergence of ample sources of economic financing.", "We extend our appreciation to the Government for its success to unravel this potential through the Tax Amnesty program.", "Up to 14 November 2016, this program has successfully collected tax payments amounting to Rp94.8 trillion, with repatriated funds amounting to Rp142.7 trillion and declared funds of Rp3,773.2 trillion.", "The accomplishment deserves to be appreciated since the Tax Amnesty program is the most succesfull program in the world.", "We view that this potential can serve as the solid momentum for the Government to accelerate tax reforms in Indonesia.", "The broadened tax base is expected to be followed by tax intensification in order to boost the role of tax as the source of development In Indonesia, the role of tax in the development financing only reached 1% of GDP in 2015, which is lower compared to that achieved by a number of countries in the region such as Singapore and Malaysia that achieved around 14% of GDP.", "We are confident that the tax intensification through the benefit of a wider tax basis, will serve as a solid

Resilience Bank Indonesia's Annual Meeting 2 Within this context, various policies that are aimed at resource allocation can be utilized as instrument of economic stabilization through countercyclical policies and also as a tool to promote equitable distribution of economic development outcomes.", "We support the government's efforts to maintain a balance between strengthening the role of government spending as a countercyclical policy instrument with efforts to maintain fiscal sustainability.", "In this context, we view that efforts to increase the composition of capital expenditure, particularly infrastructure projects, should be maintained.", "This step is needed to preserve economic stability, while simultaneously ensuring the resource allocation efficiency.", "Inthe short term, infrastructure projects will boost the purchasing power of the society, including the bottom layer group, as the projects can absorb sizeable amounts of labor.", "In line with this, vocational education to address labor demands for infrastructure projects as well as industry, also needs to be reinforced.", "In the medium to long term, we believe that the emphasis on infrastructure spending will positively improve the economy's efficiency and productivity.", "In line with the spirit to maintain stability and promote efficient resource allocation, the spending aiming to strengthen the social safety net policy through the fulfillment of basic needs in health and education also needs to continue.", "This policy will sustain the purchasing power of middle and lower layers of

current application of digital technology and robotics in the advanced economies, which has led to the decline of cheap labor's competitive advantage in the developing countries.", "This condition in

to monetary operations strategy, we view that the flexibility in the liquidity management for banks will enhance the bank's ability to absorb temporary liquidity shock thereby avoiding excess interest rate For that purpose, Bank Indonesia will begin to introduce the Reserve Requirement (GWM) Averaging system in 2017.", "With reserves averaging, banks are required to maintain an average of GWM
