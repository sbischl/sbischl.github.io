and medium - term outlook, I would make a distinction between the main scenario, which is the most likely outcome, and the risk assessment.", "The most likely scenario remains favourable with growth still close to our potential but it is now surrounded by much more uncertainty than usual.", "And that applies to other regions of the world.", "World economic growth is expected to remain robust over the medium term, despite the slowdown of the US economy, because the emerging market economies should continue to expand at a rapid pace.", "As the recent IMF World Economic Outlook points out, China, India and Russia have together accounted for half of global growth over the past year, and further strong expansion is also expected in other emerging markets and developing countries.", "This trend should improve living conditions and income for a large part of the world's population.", "It is also a source of continued support for euro area exports and investment.", "However the slowdown in the US economy could be more pronounced and the US dollar exchange rate could come under renewed downward pressure.", "In these conditions, it remains to be seen whether the recent signs of emerging economies de-coupling from US developments will usher in a sustainable process.", "Another crucial question is whether the euro will continue to bear more than its share in the resorption of global imbalances.", "Here I refer to the continuous strengthening of the exchange rate of the euro not only vis-a\u0300-vis the US dollar but also vis-a\u0300-vis the currencies of countries recording year after year large current account surpluses.", "Domestic demand for its part is expected to be supported by strong corporate sector earnings, healthy balance sheets, still moderate interest rates (lower than in the US) and better labour market conditions.", "The central scenario assumes financial markets gradually returning to normal, which does not mean that we should expect risks to be underpriced again, but simply that the current liquidity crunch will not turn into a fully-fledged credit crunch.", "This view is supported inter alia by the resilience of major financial institutions and more generally of the global financial system.", "True, profits have recently been deteriorating.", "Nevertheless this downturn in profitability starts out from a very high position.", "So far, potential credit losses appear to be manageable and banks' capital bases being largely in excess of regulatory requirements seem to be sufficiently solid to face additional stress.", "Nonetheless, the uncertainty about the exact magnitude and distribution of these losses remains and is a major cause of the persistent liquidity squeeze.", "Therefore less benign scenarios cannot be ruled out altogether and the financial turmoil might affect bank lending conditions for households and non-financial corporations, through higher costs of financing or more restrictive credit standards, as well as corporate bond spreads.", "To a certain extent this seems to be happening already, although the levels reached so far do not seem really worrying.", "All in all, credit standards and bond spreads are still well below the situation seen in 2001-2003.", "Furthermore, the tightening of credit conditions is expected to affect mainly M & A activities, more than fixed investments.", "Finally, greater uncertainty could curb both entrepreneurs' and consumers' confidence.", "It is up to policy-makers to ensure sound economic conditions and thus contribute to the preservation of economic agents' confidence.", "For its part, the Eurosystem - the European Central Bank and the national central banks associated in the single European monetary policy - has faced up to its responsibilities in this respect.", "As the other central banks, the Eurosystem has to conduct the European monetary policy with a clear medium-term orientation.", "It therefore sets interest rates with the aim of preserving price stability.", "This action hinges on a macroeconomic assessment of the risks to price stability.", "On the other hand, the Eurosystem conducts money market operations that provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the money market.", "Monetary policy decisions are about the level of official interest rates.", "Once the level of interest rates is decided, the Eurosystem has the responsibility of ensuring the smooth functioning of the segment of the money market that it is able to influence.", "It should be very clear that these two responsibilities should not be confused.", "However in fulfilling these two responsibilities, they reinforce each other, to the benefit of both macroeconomic and financial stability.", "In order to restore orderly conditions on the money markets, the Eurosystem injected liquidity over and above what is needed by the banking system under normal circumstances, through regular MRO allotments, ad hoc fine-tuning operations and supplementary longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs).", "These injections allowed banks to front-load the fulfilment of their reserve requirements and eased the tensions on the overnight interbank market.", "The Eurosystem also absorbed excess reserves when needed to avoid downward pressure on overnight rates.", "While the Eurosystem's liquidity-providing and absorbing operations had a stabilising effect on euro money markets at the shortest end, market liquidity remains thin and activity limited in the unsecured interbank market.", "Recently, the ECB clearly communicated to the markets that it will reinforce its policy of allocating sufficient liquidity to accommodate the demand of counterparties to meet reserve requirements early within the maintenance period.", "This policy will be followed as long as necessary.", "However, the restoration of normal conditions over the whole maturity spectrum depends mainly on the return of confidence and trust by market participants, both in the other participants and in their own ability to access funding in sufficient amounts.", "It must be emphasised that the Eurosystem conducted these operations through standard market-compliant procedures and without changing the overall stance of monetary policy.", "Let me now turn to an assessment of the monetary policy stance at the current juncture.", "The primary mandate of the Eurosystem is to deliver price stability in the medium term.", "On the basis of a thorough economic and monetary analysis and by acting in a firm and timely manner, the Governing Council of the ECB has to ensure that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby favouring an environment conducive to sustained economic growth and well-functioning markets.", "The rise of many commodities prices -
