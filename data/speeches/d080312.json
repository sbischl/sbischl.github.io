than good ones, with signs of economic slowdown becoming increasingly visible.", "Drawing on the information up to the end of February, the key elements of the latest data include continued correction in the housing market, further fall in consumer confidence, slowdown in consumer spending and private investment, and weaker employment numbers.", "The good news is that exports in the US are holding

commercial real estate and consumer loans may come under greater pressure, affecting bank profitability.", "With profit declining, banks may become more risk averse to protect capital, putting more pressure on credit extension and the real economy.", "So, latest US data point to a weaker outlook ahead with more downside risks in the nearterm.", "The risks include further correction in the housing market, continued tightening of the credit conditions, and further decline in economic activities.", "Outside the US, the economic picture looks less negative.", "While the adjustments in

usual will have a range of views, and I personally do not intend to offer another prediction.", "Instead, I want to share with you my thoughts on the current developments and on what this will mean for Thailand.", "To begin, one context that I think is useful in understanding the current turmoil is the unwinding of the global imbalance, triggered by corrections in the US housing market that began in 2006, and is now ongoing.", "Such unwinding is a necessary process to clear excesses and reduce financial leverages that have been built up in the form of high level of the US's current account deficits.", "Economically speaking, to reduce the deficits, the value of the US dollar needs to fall and the levels of US long-term interest rates need to rise.", "Exchange rate adjustment is

service debt by households.", "In my view, policymakers in the US have moved relatively quickly on all these fronts, which is positive for the markets.", "Let me turn now to the implications for Thailand.", "Being a small open economy, Thailand will not be able to avoid the impact of the global slowdown or the increase in economic volatilities.", "The US now forms about 12 percent of our export markets.", "As for the direct impact of the sub-prime, the exposure of the Thai banking system to CDO is very limited.", "Total investment by Thai banks on all CDOs is 0.26 percent of bank's

accordingly.", "At the end December last year, the BIS ratio for capital adequacy for the Thai banking system was 14.6 percent, well above the minimum requirement of 8.5 percent.", "More important concern, however, is the indirect economic and financial impacts through (i) possible exports decline as the result of global economy slowdown, (ii) a tightening of global liquidity, and (iii) possible increase in the volatility of capital flows, as risk is being repriced by global investors.", "These indirect impacts have a potential to impart more volatility to our markets, depending on the magnitude of the global slowdown.", "So far, no adverse impact has emerged, but with more downside risk and uncertainty ahead, it is important that one is not complacent and is alert for all possible impacts and outcomes.", "This point was fully recognized by the Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee in its meeting last month.", "The MPC's post-meeting statement made clear of the need to monitor the situation in the global market closely so that the stance of monetary policy can be appropriately and flexibly calibrated to ensure price stability and steady growth.", "Finally,

make the private sector more resilient to the impact of economic volatilities from outside.", "And third, policy regime in Thailand has become more flexible, especially the exchange rate, with market force now playing a dominant role in allocating resources.", "Such attribute provides the private sector with a mechanism to efficiently adjust to the impact of external shocks.", "I am confident that

economy with a strong foundation to continue with stronger growth and stability in the years ahead.", "This is all I want to say this evening.", "I hope it has been useful.", "And I want to end by
