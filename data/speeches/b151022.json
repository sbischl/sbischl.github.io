loans, applied through the cycles, as we have in Singapore, is a microprudential tool.", "\u2022 But when we tightened the loan-to-value ratio to as low as 20% for a third property loan, as we did a couple of years ago, it became a macroprudential tool.", "\u2022 Macroprudential policy may well be old wine, but it is in much bigger bottles!", "Macroprudential policy can also come in several different bottles.", "\u2022 Instead of relying on a single tool (e.g.", "the interest rate for monetary policy), macroprudential policy is often multi-pronged.", "For example, to cool Singapore's property market, we imposed multiple measures to target different aspects of systemic risk.", "Tighter LTV ratios on borrowers with multiple housing loans served to moderate credit-fuelled investor demand.", "\u2022 Caps on housing loan tenures served to curtail the phenomenon of those who stretched out their loans in order to meet the tighter LTV ratios.", "\u2022 Transaction taxes in the form of stamp duties served to constrain demand from investors who did not take loans to buy properties a.", "Stamp duties on sellers helped to deter speculators who resell their properties shortly after purchase.", "Stamp duties on buyers helped to curb investor demand by raising the hurdle rate.", "\u2022 Such a multi-dimensional approach required close co-ordination among the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of National Development.", "So, where does all this leave monetary policy?", "To the extent that strengthened microprudential policies coupled with the newly developed macroprudential policies can adequately address the problem of financial stability, monetary policy is freed to focus on price stability.", "\u2022 We are back in the Tinbergen

sector in the US that extends credit but is not regulated like banks.", "This will blunt the effectiveness of any macroprudential tools applied to regulated entities.", "If macroprudential policy is not able to secure financial stability on its own, could monetary policy lend a helping hand?", "\u2022 As Stan Fischer goes on to say: \"The limited macroprudential toolkit in the United States leads me to conclude that there may be times when adjustments in monetary policy should be discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability.\"", "The question then arises: under what circumstances

there could be a case for monetary policy to step in on both price stability and financial stability objectives.", "Can regulatory policy help contribute towards macroeconomic stability?", "The focus of discussion to-date has been on whether and how monetary policy can be used alongside regulatory policy to address financial stability risks.", "An interesting question is: can regulatory policy be used alongside monetary policy to help achieve macroeconomic stability?", "Macroprudential tools aimed at stabilising asset markets could have positive spillovers in moderating inflation.", "\u2022 In fact, in Singapore, we employed macroprudential measures quite deliberately to help address inflation concerns as well, not just financial stability.", "During 2010-2012, Singapore's inflation rate averaged about 4%, more than twice as high as our historical average.", "About half of this inflation was attributable to rapidly rising housing costs and car prices.", "\u2022 Housing costs, represented by actual rentals and imputed rentals on owneroccupied housing, makes up a significant share of Singapore's consumer price index.", "Car prices, while making for a much smaller share of the CPI, rose by double digits as exuberant buyers auctioned for the fixed number of permits that the government issues for buying cars.", "\u2022 Low interest rates and abundant liquidity - reflecting easy monetary conditions globally - helped to fuel strong demand for both houses and cars.", "Monetary policy - in the form of an appreciating exchange rate - reduced imported inflation to close to zero but was not as effective in curbing price pressures in the two asset markets: houses and cars.", "\u2022 Financing restrictions - in the form of LTVs and caps on loan tenures - were imposed on housing loans and car loans to moderate demand and reduce price pressures.", "\u2022 Over 2013-2014, inflation came down steadily as housing and car prices declined.", "So, monetary policy and macroprudential policy can potentially be complementary to help achieve both macroeconomic stability and financial stability.", "They can do this sometimes by acting in the same direction; sometimes in opposite directions.", "\u2022 Charles Bean7 gives a useful pedagogical exposition of how a restoration of price and financial stability could be achieved by a combination of instrument tightening and loosening, similar to employing an optimal mix of fiscal and monetary policies to influence the composition of aggregate demand.", "\u2022 But we need to deepen our understanding of when to use monetary policy and when to use macroprudential policy and when to combine the two, if at all.", "Does tighter regulation weaken the efficacy of monetary policy?", "There is one other aspect of the interaction between monetary and regulatory policy that I would like to touch on.", "\u2022 Just as monetary policy that is set to achieve macroeconomic stability can sometimes be inappropriate for financial stability, could there be a situation where regulatory policy weakens the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?", "\u2022 Do regulatory policies - either the microprudential or macroprudential variety - have an impact on market liquidity or short-term interest rates?", "The BIS recently convened a working group to assess the impact of microprudential policy on the efficacy of monetary policy.", "The report concluded that it was difficult to draw firm conclusions.", "But there were some interesting observations.", "\u2022 The lending activity of less well-capitalised, higher risk-taking or less liquid banks appears more responsive to a tightening of monetary policy.", "\u2022 This would seem to suggest that more stringent regulations tend to weaken the transmission of monetary impulses.", "\u2022 And the transmission of policy rate changes to other interest rates and asset prices may be altered if debt markets become less liquid as a result of regulatory changes.", "Let me conclude by drawing together the main points.", "\u2022 Microprudential policies are critically important for financial stability and we must get them right.",
