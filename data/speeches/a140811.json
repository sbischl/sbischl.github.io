public services?", "A poor household with cash can patronize whomsoever it wants, and not just the monopolistic government provider.", "Because the poor can pay for their medicines or their food, they will command respect from the private provider.", "Not only will a corrupt fair price shop owner not be able to divert the grain he gets since he has to sell at market price, but because he has to compete with the shop across the street, he cannot afford to be surly or lazy.", "The government can add to the effects of empowering the poor by instilling a genuine cost to being uncompetitive - by shutting down parts of the public delivery systems that do not generate enough custom.", "Much of what we need to do is already possible.", "The government intends to announce a scheme for full financial inclusion on Independence Day.", "It includes identifying the poor, creating unique biometric identifiers for them, opening linked bank accounts, and making government transfers into those accounts.", "When fully rolled out, I believe it will give the poor the choice and respect as well as the services they had to beg for in the past.", "It can break a link between poor public service, patronage, and corruption that is growing more worrisome over time.", "Undoubtedly, cash transfers will not resolve every problem, nor are they uncontroversial.", "A constant refrain from paternalistic social workers is that the poor will simply drink away any transfers.", "In fact, studies by NGOs like SEWA indicate this is not true.", "Moreover, one could experiment with sending transfers to women, who may be better spenders.", "Some argue that attaching conditions to cash transfers - for example, they will be made provided the recipient's children attend school regularly - may improve the usage of the cash.", "The danger of attaching conditionality is that if the monitor is corrupt or inefficient, the whole process of direct benefits transfers can be vitiated.", "Nevertheless, it will be useful to monitor usage carefully where automation is possible, and automatically attach further benefits to responsible usage.", "A related concern is whether cash transfers will become addictive - whether they become millstones keeping the poor in poverty rather than stepping stones out of it.", "This is an important concern.", "Cash transfers work best when they build capabilities through education and healthcare, thus expanding opportunity, rather than when they are used solely for inessential consumption.", "The vast majority amongst the poor will seize opportunities, especially for their children, with both hands.", "Nevertheless, if there is evidence that cash transfers are being misspent - and we should let data rather than pre-conceived notions drive policy - some portion could be given in the form of electronic coupons that can be spent by the specified recipient only on food, education or healthcare.", "Another set of concerns has to do with whether private providers will bother to provide services in remote areas.", "Clearly, if people in remote areas have the cash to buy, private providers will find their way there.", "Indeed, a particularly desirable outcome will be if some of the poor find work providing services that hitherto used to be provided by public servants.", "Moreover, implementing cash transfers does not mean dismantling the system of public delivery wherever it is effective - it only means that the poor will pay when they use the public service.", "The broader takeaway is that financial inclusion and direct benefits transfer can be a way of liberating the poor from dependency on indifferently delivered public services, and thus indirectly from the venal but effective politician.", "It is not a cure-all but will help the poor out of poverty and towards true political independence.", "But financial inclusion can do more; by liberating the poor and the marginalized from the clutches of the moneylender, by providing credit and advice to the entrepreneurial amongst the poor, and by giving household the ability to save and insure against accidents, it can set them on the road to economic independence, thus strengthening the political freedom that good public services will bring.", "This is why financial inclusion is so important.", "Five Ps of financial inclusion Let me end with a vision of how the RBI can speed up and enhance financial inclusion of the kind I have just outlined.", "Financial inclusion in my view is about getting five things right: Product, Place, Price, Protection, and Profit.", "If we are to draw in the poor, we need products that address their needs; a safe place to save, a reliable way to send and receive money, a quick way to borrow in times of need or to escape the clutches of the moneylender, easy-to-understand accident, life and health insurance, and an avenue to engage in saving for old age.", "Simplicity and reliability are key - what one thinks one is paying for is what one should get, without hidden clauses or opt-outs to trip one up.", "The RBI is going to nudge banks to offer a basic suite of Products to address financial needs.", "Two other attributes of products are very important.", "They should be easy to access at low transactions cost.", "In the past, this meant that the Place of delivery, that is the bank branch, had to be close to the customer.", "So a key element of the inclusion program was to expand bank branching in unbanked areas.", "Today, with various other means of reaching the customer such as the mobile phone or the business correspondent, we can be more agnostic about the means by which the customer is reached.", "In other words, \"Place\" today need not mean physical proximity, it can mean electronic proximity, or proximity via correspondents.", "Towards this end, we have liberalized the regulations on bank business correspondents, encouraged banks and mobile companies to form alliances, and started the process of licensing payment banks.", "The transactions costs of obtaining the product, including the Price and the intermediary charges, should be low.", "Since every unbanked individual likely consumes low volumes of financial services to begin with, the provider should automate transactions as far as possible to reduce costs, and use employees that are local and are commensurately paid.", "Furthermore, any regulatory burden should be minimal.", "With these objectives in mind, the RBI has started the process of licensing small local banks, and is re-examining KYC norms with a view to simplifying them.", "Last month, we removed a major hurdle in the way of migrant workers and people living in makeshift structures obtaining a bank account, that of providing proof of current address.", "New and inexperienced customers will require Protection.", "The RBI is beefing up the Consumer Protection Code, emphasizing the need for suitable products that are simple and easy to understand.", "We are also working with the government on expanding financial literacy.", "Teaching the poor the intricacies of finance has to move beyond literacy camps and into schools.", "Banks that lend to the entrepreneurial poor should find ways to advise them on business management too, or find ways to engage NGOs and organizations like NABARD in the process.", "We are also strengthening the customer grievance redressal mechanism, while looking to expand supervision, market intelligence, and coordination with law and order to reduce the proliferation of fly-by-night operators.", "Finally, while mandated targets are useful in indicating ambition (and allowing banks to anticipate a large enough scale so as to make investments), financial inclusion cannot be achieved without it being Profitable.", "So the last \"P\" is that there should be profits at the bottom of the pyramid.", "For instance, the government should be willing to pay reasonable commissions punctually for benefits transfers, and bankers should be able to charge reasonable and transparent fees or interest rates for offering services to the poor.", "One of the greatest dangers to the growth of developing countries is the middle income trap, where crony capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth.", "If the debate during the elections is any pointer, this is a very real concern of the public in India today.", "To avoid this trap, and to strengthen the independent democracy our leaders won for us sixty seven years ago, we have to improve public services, especially those targeted at the poor.", "A key mechanism to improve these services is through financial inclusion, which is going to be an important part of the government and the RBI's plans in the coming years.", "I hope many of you in this audience will join in ensuring we are successful."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
