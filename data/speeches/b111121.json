particularly at times like this - and we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.", "But we are united in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.", "At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation.", "For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit.", "This trip includes meetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global Foundries (an advanced microprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic Development Council, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.", "At the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose.", "For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State.", "These indexes are essentially local measures of output -

about a third more than the statewide average.", "The local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this recession, but the impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well established.", "During the downturn, the capital region saw a loss of about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment, considerably less severe than the 6.5 percent nationwide decline.", "Over the past year and a half, job losses have slowed.", "But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently say that a solid recovery is underway.", "The Albany area is not yet consistently adding jobs.", "This is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced by New York State.", "The state has cut a considerable number of government jobs and reduced other expenditures as part of its effort to close significant budget gaps.", "These job reductions have disproportionately slowed Albany's local economy.", "In contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany's private sector is showing signs of recovery.", "Your private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to offset the public sector job losses.", "However, this job creation has not been robust enough to bring down the unemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent of the workforce.", "That is a lower rate of unemployment than the national rate, as is usual for Albany.", "However, it is almost double the jobless rate in early 2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended.", "It will be difficult for growth in the region's economy to resume and for unemployment to decline until the public sector stabilizes.", "An important plus for the local economy is the capital region's housing sector, which has weathered the economic storm relatively well.", "As a result, the drop-off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as it has been in many other places around the country.", "Like much of Upstate New York, Albany's housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of the country.", "During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany's house prices rose by 85 percent, much higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate New York as a whole and almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen nationally.", "Unlike the rest of the nation, though, the region's housing market has been comparatively stable since then.", "Prices have declined by about 7 percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of 32 percent nationally.", "Nonetheless, declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased financial pressures on families.", "During the recession, all across the nation, high levels of debt led to a soaring number of delinquencies.", "Many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels.", "Drawing on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that these trends have certainly affected people in this area.", "But the good news is that the effects have not been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country.", "Households in the Albany region did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest of the state and country during the run-up to the crisis.", "Recent data indicate that the average adult in Albany has about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20 percent lower than the average across the state and country as a whole.", "Thus, financial strains on many families in the Albany area were lower than in many other places around the state and nation.", "However, the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the area, so it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures.", "About 4 percent of debt balances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany, which is twice the 2 percent delinquency rate in 2005.", "Although this is less than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this doubling of delinquencies in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress for many families here.", "Stepping back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of fundamental strengths.", "These strengths show through in some key ways: \uf0b7 Albany is growing.", "The recent Census shows that the population in the region expanded by 5.5 percent over the past decade, more than double the statewide average.", "Saratoga County saw an especially strong gain of nearly 10 percent.", "\uf0b7 Incomes in the region are high.", "Albany is the state's most affluent area outside the New York City metropolitan region.", "Median household income was roughly $57,000 in 2009, moderately above the statewide median and well above the nation's.", "Not surprisingly, then, the poverty rate is lower than the U.S. average -
