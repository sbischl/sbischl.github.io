appropriate standard of resilience for the financial system Given the structure of our financial system, its vulnerabilities and risks, how safe should we aim to make it?", "If Goldilocks visited our ecosystem, what would be too risky, too safe and just right?", "Our financial policy objective is to 'promote the maintenance of a sound and efficient financial system'.", "The soundness goal means promoting the resilience of the financial system as a whole and intervening to mitigate risks to it.", "The efficiency goal means different things in different contexts: we minimise compliance costs; we support innovation and operate a regime that is open to new entrants; we avoid creating unnecessary frictions in the supply of credit to the economy; and we ensure that financial resources are allocated in a productive (and not harmful) way to maximise long term economic growth.", "A key goal of Phase 2 of the Government's review is to clarify the scope and meaning of 'sound' and 'efficient'; and whether these are still the right terms.", "Taken together, soundness and efficiency are akin to the financial stability mandates of other central banks.", "They empower and obligate the Reserve Bank to ensure the financial system works effectively in support of the prosperity and wellbeing of New Zealanders and contribute to a productive and sustainable economy.", "Along with our price stability and maximum sustainable employment objectives, they empower the Bank to stabilise the in terms of society's financial cycle and to mitigate the booms and busts that are inefficient

focus on achieving financial stability has been, and remains, primarily systemic rather than on individual institutions.", "We do not run a zero-failure regime (i.e.", "financial institutions can fail), and we expect all participants to do their part.", "We pursue our financial stability goal by using the levers and tools that are available to us.", "Some of these are baseline standards,

possible) that individual institutions have incentives to manage their own risks; and on disclosure14 enabling investors to monitor risks to financial institutions.", "The risk of market failure means we must also have a robust regulatory pillar.", "Given the externalities at play in the financial system, the systemic costs of financial instability will not be addressed through self and market discipline alone.", "When an individual bank chooses to reduce its resilience, it will only face the private cost of its decision.", "The social cost will include, for example, the bank aggravating a boom-bust cycle by unduly relaxing lending standards.", "The perverse incentives are compounded if it is difficult for market participants to detect an increase in risk-taking (asymmetric information).", "We agree with the IMF's FSAP report that the regulatory pillar should be stronger, and that we should adopt a more intensive approach to supervision.", "We are strengthening our supervision of individual institutions.", "We are making more frequent use of thematic reviews on areas of heightened risk, and we continue to strengthen our collaboration with APRA.", "We recently released our joint report with the FMA on Bank Conduct and Culture.", "As the IMF pointed out, increasing supervisory resources for all financial sectors is key to boosting effectiveness and responsiveness.", "We have sought additional resourcing to do this a point that will be considered by the Government as part of Phase 2 of its review.", "Within this framework the key question is how we establish a rigorous and fair baseline of resilience for prudential regulation.", "Again it's the goldilocks question, what is safe, and just right?", "In the end it is a judgement based on experience, analysis and consultation.", "For example, we require non-life insurers to hold sufficient capital reserves or reinsurance to cover liabilities for a 1 in 1,000 year catastrophe event.", "We have set the bar high relative to global insurance standards due to New Zealand's vulnerability to natural disasters and to promote public confidence in our insurers.", "In the case of banks we are currently reviewing the capital adequacy framework.", "The aim of the capital review is to identify the most appropriate framework for setting bank capital requirements the amount of capital banks have to absorb losses taking into account both how our current framework has operated and international developments.", "There are several guiding principles.", "One is that capital requirements should be conservative, reflecting the importance to New Zealand of sound credit ratings, given our reliance on offshore borrowing and susceptibility to international shocks.", "Another is that capital requirements should be set in relation to the risk of bank exposures.", "This is particularly important for New Zealand, where banking sector assets account for the majority of total financial system assets and are concentrated in housing and agricultural lending.", "Earlier this year the Reserve Bank launched the Bank Financial Strength Dashboard.", "It allows financial information to be compared across banks.", "The aim is for the Dashboard to improve bank disclosure and public awareness and to make it easier for banks to benchmark themselves against each other.", "On the other hand, our monitoring and oversight of insurance company risk-taking and compliance is limited.", "We have only 10 supervisors and actuaries overseeing around 90 insurance companies.", "Our aim in setting minimum capital ratios and buffers is to ensure that the banking sector can absorb shocks, maintain market confidence, and continue to supply credit during times of economic stress.", "In other words, we take a systemic and through-the-cycle view of prudential regulation.", "This reduces the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.", "Soundness is not easily translated into a single, quantifiable benchmark against which performance can be monitored.", "The academic literature and various countries' prudential reforms since the GFC suggest there is a wide range of views on the optimal quantity and quality of capital for a banking system.", "Indeed, the literature generally suggests that 'optimal' capital is not only higher than regulatory minimums, but can also span quite a wide range.", "The literature is therefore helpful in pointing to the direction that regulatory capital should travel, but not the destination.", "We are naturally cautious in how we think about risk to the banking sector.", "We operate in the uncertain: the origin of the next crisis is unknown.", "And as alluded to earlier, a banking crisis would have significant costs for ordinary New Zealanders that would persist for years, in terms of economic output, public debt, employment and welfare.", "There is a good argument that there are soundness and efficiency gains to be made by requiring banks to hold more capital within reason.", "More capital would help deliver both greater certainty, and higher expected output (before and after a crisis).", "This is illustrated by figure 5, where the level of financial stability is measured on the X axis and the expected output is measured on the Y axis.", "At some point more certainty comes at a cost, though this may be justifiable if we desire greater certainty.", "However based on the literature and the views of other regulators it would seem that we are a long way from that trade off.", "Some will argue that certainty comes at a price that share capital is a more expensive form of funding than debt.", "There is a debate as to how high that price really is.", "And we need to weigh those private costs against the social costs of a crisis.", "A framework for thinking about our policy goal Financial Stability The question remains, how much certainty do we want, how risky do we want our financial system to be in the long-term?", "Goldilocks returns with the same question what level of financial stability is too risky, too safe, or just right?", "To answer this we need to think about our risk tolerance for crises.", "One input into informing the Reserve Bank's risk tolerance is stress testing.", "We ask banks to consider what would happen in the event of a severe but plausible hypothetical scenario, with macro-economic outcomes that are broadly similar to the financial crises discussed earlier.", "By quantifying the impact of this scenario on bank balance sheets and profitability, the stress tests help us to understand whether the amount of capital banks hold is enough to absorb losses under that scenario and to better understand risks to financial stability.", "They are also used to support banks in developing their own risk management practices.", "Stress tests are an important lens on both the capital adequacy of banks and on our own risk tolerance.", "They can help us to explain to the public the sorts of tail events that we worry about, and assist participants and the public in understanding the resilience of individual institutions, and the financial system as a whole, to those risks.", "That said, there is no direct link between stress tests and our banks' capital requirements.", "Interpreting their implications for system resilience requires many judgements, including on the levels of capital necessary for individual banks to maintain market confidence.", "Stress tests can't cover all risks, or the right risks happening at the same time to all banks.", "It is just one scenario.", "And banks know how the stress scenario will play out in advance, which makes it more contained than it would be in practice.", "The GFC taught us that a synchronised global downturn can happen very quickly and what was thought truly exceptional (ie the Great Depression) might not be so improbable.", "It is difficult to capture the real-world complexities of a financial crisis within formal modelling approaches used for stress testing.", "The GFC also demonstrated that the dangers to our banks may not lie just in the quality of their asset portfolios but in their ability to roll-over their funding, and at what cost.", "In other words liquidity can be the catalyst for financial stability risk.", "Our liquidity policy requires banks to maintain specified ratios of expected net cash inflow or outflow.", "It is intended to reduce the likelihood that an individual bank needs to call on us as the lender of last resort, and ultimately reduce the risk of a bank failure.", "Our minimum standards for liquidity risk also reflect the highly concentrated nature of our banking system and its reliance on foreign funding.", "We intend to review our liquidity standards next year, in light of new Basel Committee liquidity requirements.", "To date these exercises have centred on the four largest New Zealand banks - reflecting that they account for around 90% of banking system assets.", "The scenario we used for the stress test in 2017 set a high bar.", "It asked banks to consider how they would fare if there was a downturn in the Chinese economy, collapse in demand for commodity exports, a rapid increase in unemployment, a 35% fall in house prices, a two notch downgrade in their credit rating downgrade, a spike in funding costs, and a significant misconduct event related to residential mortgages.", "The results of the 2017 stress test suggest that the four main New Zealand banks could absorb material losses in a downturn while remaining solvent.", "Adapting to emerging risks Establishing a baseline standard of resilience is not a set-and-forget exercise.", "It needs to be re-visited from time to time to ensure it is still appropriate as we are doing with our capital review and as we will with our liquidity review next year.", "We also need to remain aware of changes in risks across the financial system for example, when intense competition leads to dilution in lending standards, or irrational exuberance leads to credit and asset booms.", "We need a macro view of emerging risks that reinforces the baseline prudential settings.", "Credit-fuelled housing booms are a good example of this elevation of risk.", "They have been common in the lead-up to financial crises in advanced economies in recent decades.", "The purpose of macro-prudential policy is to lean against these time-varying risks.", "Our objective is to address emerging systemic risks by increasing the resilience of the domestic financial system and countering instability that arises from credit, asset price or liquidity shocks.", "As agreed with the Minister of Finance in the 2013 Memorandum of Understanding, we have four tools to implement macro-prudential policy: the countercyclical capital buffer, sectoral capital requirements, the core funding ratio and loan-to-value restrictions (LVRs) (see figure 4).", "The first three tools increase the resilience of banks directly.", "Mortgage lending policies like LVRs and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios, which are yet to be included in our toolkit limit the amount of lending banks can do within defined parameters in order to promote soundness.", "As for baseline standards, the use of macro-prudential tools may require trade-offs between soundness and efficiency,18 between financial stability and output.", "And as for the baseline standards we operate in conditions of considerable uncertainty.", "During an economic boom, it is often hard to tell whether easing lending standards or rapid credit growth is justified by strong economic fundamentals and whether swings in capital allocation are efficient or not.", "We aim to deploy and calibrate the right macro-prudential tool to address both the perceived risk and the efficiency implications, whether by changes to banks' capital requirements or influencing lending behaviour.", "To date we have only deployed the LVR tool, in response to rapid house price growth and the sharp increase in the provision of high LVR loans that is loans with relatively small deposits.", "The Reserve Bank's speed limit on high-LVR loans has been an important mitigant to the significant increase in financial system risks associated with mortgage loans over the past five years.", "By improving the resilience of household balance sheets, the policy is expected to lower the numbers of households that are forced to sell their house or significantly reduce expenditure in a severe downturn.", "In the five years prior to the start of the GFC, house prices increased about 60 percent in the UK and 40 percent in the US.", "In the following five years, prices fell about 15 percent in the UK and 36 percent in the US.", "Measures may improve both efficiency and stability.", "In the case of 'irrational over-investment', externality costs exist with consumers and investors taking insufficient account of costs imposed on others from the increased risks of failure or recession, while capital misallocation also occurs.", "In this case stability and efficiency would both be increased through macro-prudential measures.", "Our risk tolerance for the recent housing and credit boom is implied by our calibration of the LVR restrictions.", "We keep these settings under review and will publish our next assessment of them in the upcoming FSR.", "The question we are assessing is whether the same restrictions are needed in the current environment where debt levels remain high but are not deteriorating, now that bank lending standards have tightened significantly and rapid growth in credit and house prices have stabilised.", "If these conditions continue, we expect to gradually ease the policy in coming years.", "The other macro-prudential tools also have an important role to play.", "For example, a and thereby improve banks' counter-cyclical capital buffer would increase bank capital, resilience to a crisis when risks are heightened; and reduce the extent of deleveraging by banks in a downturn, thus improving efficiency by mitigating the effects of the boom-bust cycle on the wider economy.", "The role of counter-cyclical buffers in supporting our financial stability objective overlaps with, and is a part of, the work we are doing in our capital review, as it is important that the prudential and macro-prudential capital framework support each other and operate harmoniously.", "Our thinking on these macro-prudential tools continues to evolve.", "We are also refreshing our macro-prudential strategy drawing on our experience since the MOU was put in place.", "The aim of this refresh is to clarify when and why we would use the different tools.", "We intend to communicate clearly and consistently on macro-prudential policy in order to improve people's understanding and expectations, and to support our accountability for the implementation of macro-prudential policy and its effects.", "Emerging risks to financial stability Unsurprisingly our focus in recent times has been on our main vulnerabilities: household indebtedness, the dairy sector and our foreign liabilities.", "But the financial system can become exposed to many other types of risks over time, in response to structural changes in regulation, technology, market structure or the physical environment.", "Some examples include conduct, cyber, climate change and FinTech.", "As we have seen in the UK and the US in the wake of the GFC, conduct and operational risk can have significant prudential impacts.", "In New Zealand our 2017 stress test scenario demonstrated the potentially significant impact that a failure to comply with responsible lending obligations could have for local banks.", "The reputational and financial impacts of misconduct are now playing out in Australia in the wake of the Australian Royal Commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry.", "Our own Culture & Conduct Review, carried out jointly with the FMA, is an example of how we understand and manage these risks adequately.", "Cyber attacks are another dimension of operational risk.", "They pose a significant threat to the global financial system, as shown by the 'WannaCry' attack, the 'Notpetya' attack and the cyber-heist of the Central Bank of Bangladesh.", "We continue to work with banks, whose interests in this area are aligned with our own.", "Given this, and the pace of change, we are not developing policy specifically for the control of cyber risk.", "Our focus is on At the time the LVR restrictions were introduced, high (>80%) LVR loans exceeded 20 percent of all outstanding loans, while nearly one in three new loans were high LVR loans.", "We consider those proportions implied excessive risk.", "We have slightly relaxed the rules such that they currently permit banks to make up to 15% of their new lending to owner occupiers with a deposit of 20% or less, and 5% to investors with a deposit of 35% or less.", "the resilience and business continuity dimensions of bank operations, and the security of the payment and settlement systems that the Reserve Bank operates.", "Climate change presents significant financial stability risks both through the direct implications of physical events for insurers, farmers and households, the indirect effects on insurance availability and property values, and through the potential social and economic disruption it promises.", "We are working on developing a climate change strategy, which will be informed by discussions with banks and insurers in due course.", "Our role as a regulator is to try to ensure that financial institutions are adequately managing these risks, even though the horizon for their realisation could be decades away.", "FinTech presents opportunities for banks and consumers as well as for financial stability.", "We are engaging with industry and we are willing to help where we can.", "FinTech can contribute to both the soundness and efficiency of the financial system, whether through improved payment systems or a greater diversity of institutions, and by implication fewer systemically important entities.", "Consumer benefits could be substantial as a result of increased availability and speed of services, greater competition and reduced costs of payments.", "However, initiatives like open banking also create risk some financial institutions may not adapt to the new environment as quickly as others; and liquidity could become more volatile.", "We also need to be on guard against the emergence of a shadow banking sector, structured to sit outside our regulatory perimeter, and on the need to have the right powers and tools an ongoing issue for financial market infrastructures.", "As the regulator we need to remain aware of these risks, watch for those emerging, and react appropriately so as not to forestall desirable innovation.", "Financial stability matters a lot.", "Crises have significant costs for the financial system, the wider economy and all New Zealanders.", "Small open economies can be overwhelmed by large and volatile capital flows and they can be stifled when markets freeze up.", "New Zealand has fared better than most over the last thirty years and the Reserve Bank's independence and price and financial stability objectives have been a key contributor to that.", "We believe our risks are manageable, should a downturn occur.", "But the risks to our financial system are none the less real.", "We take a fairly cautious and long-term view to achieve both soundness and efficiency.", "In doing so, we do not want to stifle innovation or new entrants.", "And we do not operate a zerofailure regime.", "We must remain alert to our structural vulnerabilities: our high levels of household prices and our banks' reliance on overseas indebtedness, our exposure to commodity funding.", "Our role and oversight of the financial system mean that we are well placed to do this.", "Last year's FSAP endorsed much of what we do while also recommending we strengthen our supervisory approach which we have started to do through thematic reviews.", "It A forthcoming RBNZ Bulletin article will survey these risks.", "recommended bolstering our macro-prudential framework by including a debt-to-income
