but a short-term appreciation cannot be ruled out.", "The banks' customers, on the other hand, are less protected against shocks from a depreciation, although data from the banks show that most of their borrowers of foreign currency-denominated loans also have substantial currency earnings and thereby a natural hedge against exchange rate movements.", "Financial Stability 2006 reported on a
