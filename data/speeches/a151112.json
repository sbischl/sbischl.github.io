in economic and social well-being.", "It needs to be considered, however, together with the other components of a society's development, such as the distribution of natural resources, health and living conditions, or the quality of the environment.", "All these elements are often but imperfectly correlated with measures of economic activity like the gross domestic product, itself a useful but limited indicator whose utilisation as an exclusive gauge has at times come under comprehensible criticism.", "In this regard, let us start with two issues.", "The first concerns labour, work.", "As Voltaire's Turk explains to Candide, work serves to ward off not just need, but also boredom and vice.", "If our living conditions have improved so enormously over the past few centuries, we owe it largely to one fundamental institution, the market, which made it possible to transcend the old subsistence economy based on barter.", "In the long run, market failures - which may range from monopolies and positional rents to laws and customs unfavourable to business activity or rules and supervisory practices incapable of deterring excessive risk-taking - engender disequilibria, impede growth, undercut labour and hinder development.", "The second question bears on the models used by economists.", "Often, these models depict economic growth as a balanced, linear process, but in reality it is far from regular, a fact that does not escape economists themselves.", "Yet over the past two centuries the market, demographics and technical progress have produced wealth, work, and better living standards for steadily increasing masses of people.", "This has come about through a series of social, individual and collective travails that have made the process non-linear, yet not random.", "In what follows I will discuss the theme of change, in particular the rapid and constant change now associated with technological developments, and the multiple interactions between the

index of social development based on energy use, civil organisation, military capability and information technology.", "Brynjolfsson and McAfee observe that his index points to an astonishing conclusion: none of the crucial innovations antedating the industrial revolution - the domestication of livestock, the development of agriculture, the foundation of cities, the rise of philosophy and the great religions, the invention of writing, the introduction of numbers - had anything like the importance for socio-economic development of the exceptional discontinuity of the late eighteenth century.", "This break was accompanied by the growth of world population from 800 million in 1750 to over 1.5 billion in 1900, 2.5 billion in 1950, 3 billion fifty years ago and over 7 billion

as is frequently the case for forecasting activity, in linear extrapolations of current trends, these projections received great attention from the mass media and political leaders, but they were greeted skeptically by many economists, including some of the most eminent of the time.", "Without seeking to downplay the limits and risks of the exploitation of natural resources implicit in the population explosion and exponential growth, the critics noted that the Report failed to take due account of two major stabilisers: the ability of relative prices to rebalance supply with demand and the response of technology.", "Notwithstanding the demonstrated power of these two mechanisms, which makes such longterm projections hazardous, the concern has not abated.", "The debate on \"sustainable development\" - development that can \"meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"4 - shows that today it is impossible

curiosity; it is a fundamental theme of today's public debate.", "A significant step was the 2006 Stern Report,5 which followed a series of important international agreements (chief among them the Kyoto Treaty of 1997) and thoroughgoing albeit undervalued studies by the World Bank and the OECD.", "Some of its assumptions were criticised, such as the discount rate it used to estimate economic costs, which was very low and thus - like The Limits to Growth - likely to neglect potential mitigating and feedback effects, such as those connected with technical progress.", "But two of the Stern Report's recommendations appear to be of special importance: to tackle the challenge of climate change at a global level, with the cooperation of all concerned, advanced, emerging and developing countries alike; and to devise incentives for the invention and use of new technologies to drastically curtail emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.", "Fifty years of great change

information and communications technology becomes self-evident if we compare the time, cost and process of drafting and publishing an article today and fifty years ago: a computer instead of a

transmission with a single click via e-mail and Internet, in place of print and the traditional distribution of paper copies by post.", "The progress generated by the exponential growth in the

from my own experience, back in the 1970s producing forecasts and economic policy analysis based on simulations from an econometric model - which at that time meant solving a hundred or so equations -

capita output more than twice as great, even though world population too has more than doubled.", "At the same time, the mobility of labour has raised the number of people who live outside their native country, from under 80 million in 1970 to nearly 250 million nowadays; and the migratory flow between developing countries now exceeds that toward the West.", "These are clearly extraordinary changes.", "We are living in a different economy, a different society, from those of even a quarter of a century ago: a global society, with an exceptionally rapid and extensive diffusion of ideas and knowledge, an enormous mass of information available, and nearly 300 times the global financial assets, in dollar value, compared with 1970 (while US consumer prices have risen just sixfold).", "In particular, the effects of combining technological innovation with the opening of markets have been astonishing.", "The stepped-up growth in per capita incomes and employment that has been achieved, thanks to the new \"supply chains,\" in many emerging countries, headed by China, is the clearest testimony.", "These changes, too, have not occurred in a straightforward, linear fashion, owing unquestionably but not solely to discontinuities in geopolitical equilibria.", "In the economic field, recurrent financial crises have struck single countries and regions, ultimately producing the extremely severe global crisis of which we still face the legacies.", "The world economy has gone through a recession every decade since the 1960s.", "The increase in welfare has not been evenly distributed among the world population.", "Although near a billion people still live in extreme poverty and destitution (with incomes of less than $1.90 a day, the new benchmark recently adopted by the World Bank), the objective of halving their number was attained in 2010, five years earlier than was called for by the UN Millennium Development Goals of 2000.", "And apart from the billion who have been lifted out of extreme poverty we should count another 2 billion added to the world population over the last twenty-five years, mostly in the emerging and developing countries, who have not entered this state.", "The gap in life expectancy between these countries and the Western world (where it has nevertheless continued to lengthen) has narrowed dramatically.", "However, while the international inequality in income distribution has diminished, the fact remains that between 1990 and 2010 domestic inequality became more severe in two thirds of the countries for which data is available.", "In the United States, while per capita output expanded by some 40 per cent between 1990 and 2007, real median household income gained less than 10 per cent.", "After the sharp drop in output and employment due to the financial crisis, production has now regained and surpassed its 2007 level, but median income has fallen back to the levels of over twenty years ago.", "It is often remarked that the wealthiest 1 per cent of the population now accounts for about 20 per cent of US national income, compared with 8 per cent fifty years ago.", "And the increase in the incomes of the super-rich (the top 0.1 per cent) has been sharper still, with an accentuation of the concentration of wealth.", "\"Secular stagnation\" and the \"second machine age\" The fact that development is a non-linear process is perceptible, among other things, in the lack of substantial productivity gains in the advanced countries consequent to the spread of the new information and communications technologies.", "In most of these countries per capita output has risen only modestly, where it has not actually contracted, as in Italy.", "The global financial crisis, which stemmed from the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble in the United States in 2007, and the euro-area sovereign debt crisis, which was triggered in early 2010 by the revelation of grave underestimates of the Greek budget deficit, have been accompanied by what has come to be known, as if in contrast to the \"Great Moderation\" of the previous two decades, as the \"Great Recession.", "\"11 Even in the United States and the United Kingdom, the countries that left the acute phase of the crisis behind them most quickly, the growth rate remains lower than in the pre-crisis years.", "In the euro area as a whole output is still below its pre-crisis level, which it is projected to regain by the end of this year.", "It is now quite generally held that the \"potential\" growth rate too has been lowered by the reduction in investment and the very high levels of long-term unemployment and underemployment.", "The recession's legacy, in other words, consists of numerous, varied problems that threaten to leave permanent, not just short-term scars on our economies.", "Today, there is renewed debate on the risk of hysteresis (i.e., the extent to which the short-term cycle influences the longer-term dynamics of the economy).", "Larry Summers has revived the \"secular stagnation\" hypothesis originally advanced by Alvin Hansen in the 1930s and forcefully rebutted in practice by the protracted economic expansion that followed World War II.", "It is somewhat singular that there has been more (and earlier) discussion of this thesis in the United States than in the euro area, where the difficulties that impede a return to sustained growth are particularly evident and the deficit in employment and demand is so substantial.", "The new secular stagnation hypothesis refers to the increasing propensity to save (in order to pay down excessive debt) and to the reduction in investment and in aggregate demand in recent years.", "The decline in the relative price of capital goods induced by technological innovation, despite having resulted in a substitution of capital for labour, may also have played a role in lowering investment expenditure in nominal terms.", "As Summers notes, unlike new business ventures in the traditional sectors, those in the digital economy may require a reduced amount of money to start up, thus resulting in a possible reduction in the aggregate capital expenditure.", "In circumstances like these, maintaining the balance between saving and investment - which is essential to achieving full employment - could require a level of negative real interest rates (that is, net of inflation), that monetary policy cannot deliver.", "Nominal interest rates, in fact, are now close to zero and the increase in prices is minimal.", "The consequence is stagnant economic activity and the underutilisation of resources.", "Furthermore, the legacy of the financial crisis - namely the need to reduce financial leverage and decrease public and private debt - would not appear to be temporary.", "Against the backdrop of low inflation and reduced potential growth, the global ratio of debt to output continues to rise.", "See, for one, C.

our ways of communicating and acquiring information, confirms the far-reaching benefits that the entire society obtains from technical progress.", "But digital technologies have a distinctive feature: the greater speed with which they tend to replace labour, even in fields in which human intervention has always appeared to be decisive.", "This suggests the revival of the concept of \"technological unemployment\" proposed by Keynes in his 1930 essay on the prospects for future generations18 and thus indicated as one of the forces behind the decline in job opportunities and the stagnation of wages and incomes observed in a number of industries and countries.", "As we know, without bringing Ned Ludd or Karl Marx into it, this debate is not new.", "But we can recall Keynes's own optimism and his prediction that given the tendencies of technical progress and the increase in productivity in the United Kingdom and the United States and \"assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved ... within a hundred years\" with a fourfold to eightfold rise in per capita income.", "Today we are talking about a global economy, new technologies and population ageing; we note that exceptionally violent wars and population growth have not been lacking, but even so the order of magnitude of the rise in per capita income that Keynes projected for the century does not appear to be unreasonable.", "However, his fear that the most severe challenge would be how to occupy our leisure time, as we would be astonishingly more wealthy but technologically unemployed, has certainly not materialised.", "Fifty years ago, when Dylan's emblematic song first appeared in the United States, a small book was published in the United Kingdom that dealt with production efficiency, income distribution and corporate ownership.", "It was written by James Meade, an economist and Keynes' disciple, well-known for his work in the field of international trade, which would eventually earn him the Nobel Prize in 1977.19 More than pose the social and economic problem of what to do when automation means that \"we need to work only an hour or two a day to obtain the total output of real goods and services needed to satisfy our wants,\" Meade asked \"What shall we do when output per man-hour of work is extremely high but practically the whole of the output goes to a few property owners, while the mass of the workers are relatively (or even absolutely) worse off than before?", "\"20 What can we say on this point today?", "To my mind, we must consider the matter on three levels.", "First, the crucial question is to determine whether the net loss of jobs due to technological innovation is temporary or permanent.", "As I recalled above, history shows that, although automation has certainly brought about the substitution of capital for labour in given economic sectors, for the economy as a whole, technical progress has been the source of new and better work opportunities.", "It is legitimate to ask whether things may not be different this time around.", "So far, in the United States and elsewhere, new technology has created a polarisation of occupations, with employment gains concentrated in low-paid service jobs and high-paid jobs requiring considerable educational attainment, to the expense of mid-skilled jobs.", "A recent, widely-cited study by two researchers at Oxford has estimated that 47 per cent of existing jobs in the United States risk being automated out of existence, possibly within a decade or two.", "Other analysts, at the Bruegel research centre,22 have produced estimates of over 50 per cent for the main European countries, including Italy (which so far appears to have suffered more from globalisation and the heightened competition of the emerging market economies than from technological innovation).", "Such estimates will certainly make a powerful impression on readers, but they must be handled with great caution, given the patent difficulty of assigning risk percentages to jobs whose content may change radically thanks to the new technology itself.", "In the past we have seen drastic transformations in the composition of employment: just think of the drastic drop in agricultural employment in the industrial countries since World War II.", "The destruction of some jobs will certainly correspond to the creation of new ones, and the net result is anything but a foregone conclusion, though of course we cannot ignore the adverse effects characteristic of a phase of transition like the present.", "As yet, the new information and communications technology is still complementary to managerial and intellectual jobs but substitutive of routine tasks.", "The new wave of technological innovation in the fields mentioned earlier (robotics, genomics, artificial intelligence) could nevertheless have a substantial impact on the labour demand relative to non-routine tasks that cannot, apparently, be standardised, at both high and low levels of skill.", "The second question is the relationship between technological progress and the increase in income inequality so forcefully anticipated by Meade.", "Such a vast issue cannot be discussed in a few lines.", "The sensation made by Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century24 readily demonstrates how topical it is.", "Here the point seems to me to be not just to decry the emergence of entertainment superstars, top executives and the great rentiers (the top 0.1 per cent of the population), who would appear to be - thanks to skill, luck, or monopoly positions - the great beneficiaries of the economic transformation of recent decades, and accordingly call for income redistribution for reasons of social equity.", "Rather, it is to determine the extent to which current and prospective trends in technology can alter, for the purposes of economic growth, today's relationship between capital and labour, how great the risk is that substantial portions of the work force will be driven out of the production process, regardless of their level of education and competence.", "The question, therefore, is what to do to avert human, social and political consequences that are potentially very severe indeed.", "These are clearly questions for the long term.", "We must be skeptical of extreme

spending on education; and infrastructure, not just highways and airports but also water supply, waste disposal, electric power grids and communications networks.", "In its October 2014 issue, the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook returned forcefully to the theme of the possible impact of infrastructural investment on short-term demand and medium-term supply.", "In Europe, Bart van Ark, among others, maintains that if the main problem is still making good the deficit in productivity growth, then firms must rapidly catch up in adopting the new digital technologies.", "Before asking what the future holds for us now, we must start from the recognition that there is a serious deficit in Europe, and especially in Italy, not only of growth but also of demand, hence of employment and incomes.", "Strong stimulus for investment, public and private, national and European, is accordingly essential.", "Even raising the rate of growth in productivity requires well-targeted investments in new technology, to be sure, but also in intangible infrastructures that can generate increasing returns over the medium-to-long term.", "If there is a lack of investment due to the high cost of capital in some countries, doubts about demand, or uncertainty over the state and continuity of \"structural reforms,\" it is the responsibility of the political system and economic policy - and of those in leading positions in society, in the information industry and in training and education - to act with resolution, foresight and singleness of purpose to remove these impediments.", "In Italy, in particular, given an economy and a society that have been practically stalled since well before the onset of the financial crisis, there is great potential for improvement, by removing constraints and rigidity, accelerating the adoption of new technology, closing the gap that separates many industries from the productivity frontier, and refurbishing infrastructures, including the most traditional ones.", "In the search for a new model of development, or at least a return to balanced, sustainable economic growth, we can start from Acemoglu and Robinson's observation on how important it is to maintain a pluralist society and renew our political and economic institutions in a more inclusive direction.", "Specifically, it is not enough to set out reasonable objectives if the conditions for attaining them are lacking.", "In some cases, these conditions are unlikely to present themselves.", "The objective of bringing manufacturing value added back up from its current 15-16 per cent of GDP to 20 per cent by 2020, as it was a decade and more ago, proposed quite emphatically in the European Commission's strategy for the next few years33, will run into evident historical and methodological obstacles.", "On the one hand it is most likely, owing notably to the spread of automation, that value added will be derived increasingly from sectors outside manufacturing.", "As in the case of agriculture, this does not necessarily reduce its importance for a nation's economy or a society's value system.", "But it does spotlight the risk of overstating its potential to create jobs.", "On the other hand, the spread of new technologies is making even the very definitions of economic sectors obsolete.", "E.
