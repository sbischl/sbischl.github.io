"In his Economic and Fiscal Update November 16, Minister Goodale described the remarkable strength and resiliency of the Canadian economy following numerous shocks in 2003, including SARS, a single, isolated case of \"mad cow\" disease and the strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar.", "Canada weathered this period of economic slowdown, and has recovered from relatively weak growth of two per cent in 2003.", "In fact, Canada saw growth of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year - much stronger than expected.", "Private sector forecasters now expect growth of three per cent for all of

that you can't forever consume more than you produce.", "They displayed the innate good sense necessary to make short-term sacrifices for the long-term interests of their families.", "As a result,

equipment, and enhancing research and innovation.", "The Government is also focused on the delivery of other key commitments to Canadians, including: High-quality early childhood development; Predictable and long-term funding to municipalities for critical infrastructure needs; Meaningful action on the disparities that impede opportunities for Aboriginal Canadians; and Meeting the imperatives of national defence and national security.", "As Minister Goodale said in his Economic and Fiscal Update presentation, meeting these priorities will require ongoing fiscal discipline.", "It will also require attention to improving productivity.", "But given the current high ratio of employment to population, and given that Canada's population will soon begin to age rapidly, we will

importance of international monetary arrangements to facilitate the reduction of imbalances.", "Most major industrialized countries and a large number of emerging market countries are operating with flexible exchange rates.", "The notable exceptions are China and a number of countries in Southeast Asia which, either explicitly or implicitly, tie their currencies to the yuan, which is in turn pegged to the U.S. dollar.", "With two systems operating, not everyone is playing by the same \"set of rules,\" and imbalances are building.", "The concern is two-fold: First, the sense that some countries are not playing by the rules could give rise to protectionism, with potentially very serious negative consequences for the global trading system.", "\u2022 And second, a disproportionate burden of adjustment to changing economic circumstances is being borne by those of us with flexible exchange regimes, including Canada and Europe.", "So there is a real need, going forward, to think
