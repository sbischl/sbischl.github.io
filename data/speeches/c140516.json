improvement in the quality of Central Bank publications; and improved mechanisms for handling media & public inquiries.", "Ladies and Gentlemen; To effectively execute its mandate, the Central Bank relies on a wide range of information inputs from various stakeholders, including the media.", "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for instance regularly reviews media coverage of the financial and economic news as well as media predictions about the likely direction of monetary policy.", "In addition, the Bank normally takes great interest in the media review of its decisions.", "The financial news therefore forms a useful part of what broadly shapes policy making.", "I will discuss more of this in my presentation.", "Ladies and gentlemen: It is in view of your pivotal role as both information intermediaries and a unique target of our communication, that the Central Bank is keen to develop a structured engagement with the financial media.", "The Bank recognizes the need to \"ride on your backs\", so to speak, to reach the ultimate stakeholder, the mwananchi.", "In order to empower you to undertake this role, the Central Bank would like to contribute, within its means, to the development of a budding financial journalism sector in Kenya through appropriate capacity building programmes for business journalists.", "As Kenya aspires to become a regional financial hub, the role of financial journalists cannot be gainsaid.", "The need for journalists with comprehensive economic reporting and analytical capabilities will become increasingly necessary if Kenya is to achieve and sustain the regional financial hub status.", "The Central Bank seeks to collaborate with the media in supporting broad based educational programmes for the society, such as Financial Literacy and promotion of a Savings Culture.", "Ladies and gentlemen: All that I have described in my remarks emphasize the need for mutual cooperation and partnership.", "Indeed, this workshop's theme is \"Building a Platform for Greater Partnership\".", "Going forward, we at the Central Bank commit to working closely with you in partnership to serve our nation better.", "This workshop is therefore forms the start of a \"win-win\" engagement that leads to better service delivery for our stakeholders.", "We also look forward to learning from you as you constructively critique the effectiveness of our communication and offer suggestions.", "Key questions moving forward in this partnership are: What are the practical steps that will anchor the partnerships between us?", "How do we ensure a sustainably structured framework in which policy intentions of the Central Bank gain traction in the public domain?", "How do we reduce superfluous noise that occasionally cloud the greater and more fundamental achievements in the policy terrain?", "How do we move forward with the agenda emerging from the cross-fertilization of ideas that will emerge from the workshop?", "Ladies and gentlemen; the Central Bank proposes a structured capacity building programme targeting business writers who cover the financial sector.", "In collaboration with the Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS), the Central Bank will be seeking the input of the financial media to develop an appropriate Business Editors' training curriculum that takes cognizance of the needs of the financial sector, in light our stage of development.", "In addition, the Bank will be hosting a Business Journalists workshop once a year, which will be appropriately themed to reflect the issues of the time.", "Furthermore, the Central Bank in partnership with other financial sector regulators proposes the formation of a Business Editors & Financial Regulators Forum.", "The role of this forum shall be largely advisory and will be tasked with providing appropriate advice on public education campaigns on broad latitude of themes such as financial education & literacy campaigns, and other mutually agreed programmes within the core competencies of the media.", "I believe these proposals will be refined as we go along and what emerges from this workshop will further shed more light in this regard.", "Once again I thank you for taking time off your busy schedules to participate in this workshop.", "May I also take this opportunity to appreciate my colleagues at the Central Bank for organizing this workshop successfully.", "And to the management and staff of Enashipai Resort and Spa for the excellent hospitality extended to us.", "Ladies and gentlemen;
