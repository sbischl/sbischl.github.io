there are now signs that this view is changing.", "The pandemic may mark a turning point.", "In the period ahead, we are likely to see a more active fiscal policy among many of Norway's trading partners.", "There are several reasons for this.", "For one thing, there is a recognition that the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is limited.", "After the financial crisis, a number of central banks have assumed considerable responsibility for sustaining activity and smoothing economic fluctuations.", "At the beginning of last year, policy rates were therefore already at very low levels (Chart 7).", "At the same time, low policy rates reflect long-term trends, such as an ageing population, a high willingness to save, greater inequality and declining productivity growth.", "The result is that the level of what we refer to as the neutral interest rate is lower than before, even when economic conditions are in balance.", "The room for policy rate reductions in downturns is therefore smaller.", "The change in the view of fiscal policy's role also reflects the growing focus on structural challenges: economic inequality, a shift towards a greener economy and the need for investment in digital infrastructure.", "In the new US administration, we find this policy expressed by the motto \"Build back better\".", "In the euro area, the policy has been labelled the \"European Green Deal\".", "Chart 8 Debt grows in response to each crisis Advanced economy public debt as a share of GDP.)", "If government spending increases, there is one concern that arises.", "An amount borrowed

8).", "During the financial crisis, governments in many advanced economies borrowed on a large scale.", "Much of this debt was still outstanding at the beginning of 2020.", "During the pandemic, borrowing needs have again been substantial.", "Public debt has ballooned to new heights.", "Persistently low interest rates mean that government borrowing appears to be on favourable terms.", "But at some point further ahead, interest rates will rise again.", "Central banks will have to consolidate their balance sheets.", "Some countries will then find themselves in vulnerable position.", "NORWAY WAS WELL POSITIONED Norway clearly stands out in this regard.", "We were well positioned to face the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic.", "Unlike many other countries, we have been able to pursue a very active fiscal policy without having to borrow.", "We also had room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.", "In a little over a month, it will be 20 years since the current framework for the division of responsibility in economic policy was established.", "Fiscal policy would be guided by the fiscal rule, while monetary policy would target inflation.", "Up until 2001, fiscal policy was responsible for stabilising employment and output.", "After the switch to inflation targeting, monetary policy has functioned as the first line of defence in stabilisation policy.", "The primary task of monetary policy is to ensure monetary stability.", "It must not pursue its primary objective to the exclusion of other relevant considerations.", "Monetary policy must also take into account the real economy.", "A monetary policy regime that ends up amplifying fluctuations in the real economy will fail the test of time.", "As long as confidence in low and stable inflation is well anchored, monetary policy can contribute to high and stable output and employment.", "exchange rate has functioned as an important shock absorber.", "When Norway s terms of trade weakened owing to the oil price fall, a weaker krone helped to support business sector competitiveness.", "In the space of a short time, the policy rate was lowered to zero (Chart 9).", "The policy rate cuts had a broad impact and freed up funds for indebted businesses and households.", "As containment measures are scaled back, continued low interest rates will underpin consumption and investment, paving the way for a resumption of business activity.", "The room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is nearly exhausted.", "We do not envisage making further policy rate cuts from today's level.", "Yet as long as the crisis is ongoing, an expansionary monetary policy will be needed to stimulate the economy.", "This reduces the risk that unemployment becomes entrenched at a high level.", "At the same time, persistently low interest rates entail a risk of a build-up of financial imbalances.", "In Norway, rapidly rising house prices and further household debt accumulation pose a particular risk.", "Once there are clear signs that economic conditions are normalising, we will again seek to normalise the use of instruments - as we did after the financial crisis in 2008 and after the oil price fall in SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT PENSION FUND GLOBAL 18 FEBRUARY 2021 The monetary policy stance in the period ahead will be influenced by the timing and means of fiscal policy normalisation.", "Here the authorities face a difficult balancing act.", "On the one hand, the crisis is not yet over, and there is uncertainty regarding infection rates and the progress of vaccination.", "Against this background, the Storting (Norwegian parliament) has decided to extend the extraordinary support measures aimed at both individuals and businesses until September.", "At the same time, it is important that the support measures are scaled back as the situation becomes more normal.", "If these measures are extended too far into the future, we risk impeding necessary business restructuring.", "Workers may miss out on opportunities to seek new jobs, and unemployment may become entrenched at a higher level than prior to the crisis.", "In the light of long-term considerations, it is also important to reverse the sharp rise in government spending during the crisis.", "In 2020, NOK 300 billion was transferred from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) to cover the central government budget deficit.", "The decision to tap the GPFG has been the right one.", "An economic shock of the scale that we have witnessed requires potent medicine.", "The GPFG is intended to act as a buffer when the economy is exposed to shocks.", "At the same time, it is an intergenerational investment fund to be distributed across current and future generations.", "The pandemic is the third large economic shock to hit the Norwegian economy in the space of a few years.", "Each time, transfers from the GPFG to the central government budget have increased, but without being substantially reduced afterward.", "Chart 10 Before the crisis: One krone in six transferred from the GPFG Transfers from the GPFG as a share of public spending.", "Because of the fund s substantial size, this has been possible without breaching the fiscal rule.", "In the course of a decade, public budgets have come to rely heavily on the return on the GPFG, which was originally established to shield the Norwegian economy from oil price volatility.", "Today, a large portion of the resources under the shelf has been tapped and converted into investments in global equities and bonds.", "The GPFG has grown to become immense.", "This has provided fiscal space, but it has also increased our exposure to fluctuations in global securities markets.", "One vulnerability has been replaced with another.", "Chart 11 Considerable movements through 2020 GPFG.", "In billions of NOK 1000 1000 Return Krone exchange rate Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Source: Norges Bank The year 2020 clearly illustrated how quickly equity markets can change course - in both directions.", "The decline was more brutal and the rebound faster than we have previously seen.", "Over 22 days, the global composite equity index fell by 20 percent, but the markets quickly reversed direction.", "Already in the second quarter, the GPFG's worst quarterly result turned around to one of its best (Chart 11).", "The GPFG has enjoyed several years of solid returns - above the returns expected.", "This does not mean that we should revise up expected future returns - perhaps the opposite.", "Chart 12 Low long-term interest rates Ten-year US Treasury yield.", "The estimate was most recently updated in connection with the decision to increase the allocation to equities.", "Two key variables were used in the calculation.", "One was the expected return on the fixed income portfolio, and the other the size of the equity risk premium, which is the extra compensation we expect when taking risk in the equity market.", "The bulk of the fixed income portfolio is invested in long-dated sovereign bonds.", "When interest rates fall, bond prices rise.", "The return on the fixed income portfolio therefore held steady through the period of falling interest rates.", "Interest rates have now fallen to historic lows, and the expected return on the fixed income portfolio going forward has fallen.", "Equity prices have risen sharply in recent years.", "Taking risk in the equity market has paid handsomely.", "But we cannot assume that the gains will be as high in the future.", "If we were to repeat our calculations from 2016, the changes in interest rates alone would have reduced the estimated expected real return from around 3 percent to about 2 percent annually.", "Such estimates are fundamentally uncertain.", "The actual return may be substantially lower or higher than this estimate, as the history of the GPFG has shown.", "Even so, this uncertainty is something that we should bear in mind when drafting future central government budgets.", "ECONOMIC Eleven months ago, Norway had to lock down.", "At that time, we had no vaccine or PERSPECTIVES 18 FEBRUARY 2021 medicines that could prevent the illness from spreading.", "We had to resort to wellknown remedies: Hand disinfectant, soap, hot water and not least - social distancing.", "Here at Norges Bank, it has not been any different.", "During the Spanish flu pandemic, Norges Bank decided to dispense a daily dose of cognac to employees who were ill or not feeling very well.", "And as Chief Cashier Cederstr\u00f8m could report: \"...Its effect was instantaneous - no one got sicker, and everyone got better - the Spanish flu was no longer raging at Norges Bank.\"", "Nowadays, most of us would have politely declined the offer of cognac during working hours.", "The vaccine is a safer bet.", "There are brighter and better days ahead.", "The pandemic will soon be on its way out.", "For those who have become unemployed

affected Covid-19 patients.", "We have leaned on a well-developed welfare system.", "Covid-19 patients and symptomatic persons have been able to stay at home.", "The unemployed have not been left
