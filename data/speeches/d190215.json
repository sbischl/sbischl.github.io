if private payment solutions are not functioning or do not meet the expectations of the public in terms of security and efficiency.", "Even though the use of cash has declined, cash is still in use and has important contingency functions.", "But new digital alternatives are emerging.", "Norges Bank is therefore considering whether the central bank should also offer the public central bank digital currency.", "Like cash, central bank digital currency will be a claim on the central bank.", "It will have to be designed to be a risk-free alternative to private payment solutions and to function in a contingency in the same way as cash does.", "It can be based on account systems, as we know them today, or it can be a digital variant of banknotes and coins.", "The latter alternative will entail a clear distinction between central bank digital currency and banks' deposit money.", "In the future, central bank digital currency may be necessary for ensuring an efficient and robust payment system.", "Its most important purpose will be to underpin confidence in the monetary system.", "MONETARY STABILITY In order to serve as generally accepted means of payment, money must have a

economy.", "As long as inflation remains under control, monetary policy can react quickly to changes in the outlook for output and employment.", "If the effects are pronounced, other policy areas, including fiscal policy, will also have to contribute.", "In this respect, Norway is in a favourable position: the government has financial leeway in the form of savings in the oil fund.", "In other countries, particularly in the euro area, the picture is quite different.", "Over the past decade, monetary policy has had to assume almost sole responsibility for getting these economies back on their feet.", "After a few years of solid growth in the euro area, growth has fallen back.", "The interest rate level in Europe remains low, and monetary policy normalisation will take time.", "In this environment, new negative shocks would be very untimely for those economies.", "The policy space available for coping with a new downturn is limited.", "To conclude, globalisation, digitalisation and structural changes are facets of the same long-term trend - we are in the midst of a technology-driven growth process that encompasses much of the world.", "It is easy to focus on the downsides, but we must also keep our eyes fixed on the big picture: never before have so many taken part in a journey with such a great leap in prosperity.", "But growth is unevenly distributed.", "The winners
