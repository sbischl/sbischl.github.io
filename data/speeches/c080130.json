the fast-rising mutual funds industry; the corporate sector; and even retail investors.", "The secondary market could offer corporate treasurers new opportunities for liquidity management.", "Since secondary market trading will, for the first time, facilitate market pricing of securities, it will allow pension funds and mutual funds to value their fixed income portfolios on an ongoing basis.", "One would expect that a more accurate assessment of their portfolio will help pension funds better plan their investment strategies.", "Another important advantage is that the secondary market will extend the menu of investment instruments; no longer will the investor be compelled to hold on to his five-year bond; rather, the pension fund can sell its five-year bond and invest in bonds of longer or shorter maturities according to interest rate expectations.", "As regards the retail market, recent initiatives in the primary bond auctions have made investment in government bonds more accessible to the individual investors.", "You may recall, the last three bond auctions allowed individuals to purchase bonds in amounts as small as $1,000.", "With the secondary market, the small investor can now approach any Government Securities Intermediary (GSI) to buy and sell bonds, at any time, and have confidence in the transparency of the pricing process.", "Our mandate to foster the development of a secondary market in government securities will also include efforts to develop the use of these securities in repurchase agreements (repos).", "The repo market permits borrowing and lending among market participants, including financial institutions and corporates, to take place on a safe and secure basis while reducing both credit risks and transaction costs.", "The SEC is now in the process of devising a set of rules and a standard \"repo\" agreement to underpin the \"repo\" market.", "Let me concede that the promotion of a vibrant secondary market for government securities has proven to be a major challenge for developing and emerging market economies.", "Newly developed secondary markets are usually very thin and illiquid, with few people willing to sell and many willing buyers.", "There is no doubt that success depends on the active participation of a whole host of stakeholders - the Government, the Central Bank, as well as all the market participants.", "If the secondary market is to work: Institutional investors will need to look for opportunities for profitable trading and not simply accept the traditional \"buy and hold\" culture.", "Banks and other financial institutions, who are the main holders of government paper, will need to see the profit-making opportunities in promoting the sale of government securities to end-investors.", "The Central Bank has the responsibility for fostering credibility in the auction process, and maintaining efficient clearing and settlement systems.", "Currently only the securities issued in auctions since 2004, are currently included in the depository managed by the Central Bank and listed on the Stock Exchange.", "The Bank needs to be appointed Registrar for government bonds issued before 2004 and is working with trustees to effect this.", "When this exercise is completed, bondholders will be asked to deposit their bond certificates with the Bank in exchange for an electronic deposit record of their bond holdings.", "This process will increase the volume of bonds available for trading on the stock exchange.", "Government, for its part, must guarantee a regular and predictable supply of primary issuance so that institutions could be assured of replenishing their positions after selling securities from their portfolios.", "One way of ensuring supply, is to bring public entities into the auction mechanism instead of relying on bank financing or the underwriting process.", "The SEC has the mandate for preparing and enforcing the rules and regulations pertaining to the secondary market.", "These include regulation of the market intermediaries, market surveillance and transparency and reporting requirements and market conduct regulation;
