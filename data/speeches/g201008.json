\"From crisis to recovery...\" - reminds us of a quote from Hannah Arendt: \"a crisis becomes a disaster only when we respond to it with preformed judgments, that is, with prejudices. \"", "Today crises are multifaceted and our duty as policymakers is to prevent them from turning into disasters.", "To this end, we have to put aside prejudices and come up with concrete solutions.", "In my speech today, I will focus on two short-term challenges: Brexit obviously, and perhaps more surprisingly the future of Europe payments.", "Preparing for Brexit: a top priority Brexit is a burning and unavoidable issue.", "I will not comment on the UK's domestic politics nor on the ongoing negotiations with the EU.", "But amidst all this deep fog, one thing remains clear: achieving a fair and well-balanced Brexit deal would be in the economic interest of first and foresmost Britain but also the EU.", "But what is at stake for the EU is nothing less than preserving the integrity of our single market and its competitiveness.", "In this regard, EU countries should maintain consistency in regulatory practices vis-a\u0300-vis all third countries - including the U.K.", "Even if there is a trade deal, which I do still wish and hope, Britain will have left the single market and hence things will change anyway significantly for financial services.", "It means that firms operating under the European passport must quickly finalise their relocation to the EU if they want to operate here as of next year.", "As of September, the ACPR authorised 43 entities to ensure continuity of activities in France, including 4 credit institutions, 21 investment firms and 7 third country branches.", "If we include asset relocations of French groups from their branches in the UK, approximately 150 billion euros in assets will have been relocated to France by the end of this year.", "In addition, 31 entities, mainly investment firms, have applied for a license in France and their projects are currently being assessed by the ACPR.", "All these are good news, but let me bring two matters to your attention.", "A handful of small firms, notably in payments electronic money and investment, must urgently accelerate the process or risk being caught out in January.", "Concerning European major institutions, the EU will not permit empty shells with only partial relocation of staff or booking arrangements.", "What has been agreed on with the SSM - within the framework of Target operating models (TOM) - in relation to the relocation of staff and assets has to be implemented at once and in any event before the end of this year.", "Regarding CCPs, equivalence decisions by the Commission will ensure continuity of access to UK CCPs after 31 December 2020, until 30 June 2022.", "Beyond this transition, it is key to address the financial stability risks stemming from an excessive dependence on UK CCPs.", "The 18 month limited equivalence decision aims to give market participants the time needed to reduce their exposure to UK CCPs that are systemically important for the Union.", "This timeframe will also be used by ESMA to conduct a comprehensive review of the systemic importance of UK CCPs to the Union as foreseen by EMIR 2.2.", "This will include a fully reasoned assessment whether some of the clearing services are of such substantial systemic importance that the CCP should for euro-denominated activities be relocated on the continent.", "Considering the size and the concentration of some of these clearing services, betting on the status quo would be a losing proposition, including for clearing members: a swift relocation is in the interest of all participants and relies as such on the attractiveness of the clearing offer that EU CCPs are encouraged to build in order to help the emergence of a new liquidity pool.", "Clearly, Brexit is, and will remain, bad news mainly for the United Kingdom, but also for Europe.", "Yet Brexit also represents an opportunity to restructure the European financial system.", "The euro area starts with strong assets: an effective monetary Eurosystem, the legal framework for a single financial market and essential components of a Banking Union.", "However we do not yet have a \"financial Eurosystem\" with strong pan-European financial institutions and market infrastructure.", "There is at last a move in favour of banks consolidation in the euro area, which I always supported.", "The ECB fostered it with its welcome proposal on the recognition of badwills.", "But beyond domestic consolidations in some jurisdictions where it is not yet entirely done, we need more cross-borders ones; it should be part of a real Banking Union.", "On markets, let's be clear: there will not be a single City for the continent, but rather an integrated polycentric network of financial centres, with specialisations based on areas of expertise.", "A polycentric system of this nature can clearly function, as illustrated by the United States: New York's financial centre is favoured by corporate and investment banks, Chicago's financial centre handles futures, while Boston specialises in asset management.", "Likewise, Paris is well qualified to become the \"market hub\" of this new European constellation.", "France will be the biggest capital market in the EU on the other side of Brexit.", "According to a recent study by the British Think Tank New Financial, it will take the lead in the EU in 14 of 30 sectors studied .", "This polycentric structure would improve the circulation of the abundant savings in the euro area - a surplus amounting to EUR 360 billion last year - channelling them towards financing needs on the continent.", "Besides, euro area businesses have been lacking equity financing for many years now.", "The Capital Markets Union - and what I more broadly call a \"Financing Union for Investment and Innovation\" - is even more essential given the prospect of Brexit.", "European governments all agree in principle; but so far it remains a blind spot in the recovery strategy.", "Let us at last turn words into action.", "Preparing Europe payments for the digital currency age Payments are not a usual topic for Europlace and distinguished financial forums.", "Indeed, they used to be considered as technical, back-office and even boring stuff.", "But a revolution is underway, and if we collectively miss it, it would mean a massive disintermediation of banks in the two key assets linked to payments: daily customer relations, and personal data.", "And it would also mean a major loss of sovereignty for Europe.", "To this day, the coexistence and complementarity of central bank and commercial bank money as settlement assets has structured the payment landscape.", "Yet this structure is increasingly being questioned.", "The development of cheap and innovative digital payment solutions is leading to a decline of the use of cash in transactions, and an increase of cashless payments, which leads to a wider use of commercial bank money.", "Besides, our European ecosystem has become critically dependent on non-European players - already major global card-schemes, and more and more Bigtechs - with little control over business continuity and data protection.", "Meanwhile, the development of crypto-assets and socalled \"stablecoins\" aims to create a new category of settlement assets.", "Stablecoins may compete against both commercial and central bank money, even though they do not offer the same guarantees in terms of credit risk, liquidity, service continuity, and neutrality.", "Indeed, current digitalisation triggers at least two important risks: (i) the risk that BigTechs will build private financial infrastructures and \"monetary\" systems, competing with the public monetary sovereignty; and (ii) the symmetric risk that some jurisdictions judge that the only way to respond to the overwhelming private payments' wave would be to issue and spread on a domestic but also a global basis, \"their\" CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency).", "I already called - including here at Europlace - for a holistic European payments strategy.", "The good news is that in the last months we made decisive progress in designing it, thanks to the commitment of the Commission and the ECB.", "Christine Lagarde as President, and Fabio Panetta as Board's member in charge of payments changed the game through their personal involvement.", "There are three key elements: 1/ A European regulation of stablecoins, as drafted by the European Commission.", "This socalled \"MiCa\" has two strengths: its rightly speaks of \"Crypto-assets\", and not \"Cryptocurrencies\" which is a misleading expression.", "And on substance, the draft requires a strict and dual supervision -
