2008.", "Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity.", "Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, the Governing Council of the ECB will continue to be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize.", "A price stability-oriented monetary policy is a necessary precondition for sustainable dynamic growth and employment, but it is by no means the only precondition.", "Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound public finances, ambitious structural reforms and a competitive economic framework.", "It is important to understand that unsustainable fiscal policies may put the entire euro area at risk.", "For instance, higher risk premiums in response to unsustainable policies in one Member State could spill over to other euro-area countries.", "Euro-area membership thus also means compliance with a stringent regulatory framework, the Stability and Growth Pact.", "We are aware that structural improvements are only part of the reason for the current improvement in euro-area fiscal balances, from -1.6% in 2006 to an expected -1.0% in 2007.", "Thus, it is essential that any budgetary leeway granted by the current favorable economic environment be used for lasting budgetary consolidation in order to prepare for challenges such as population ageing and to create room to maneuver for future economic downturns.", "In addition, structural polices are needed to ensure that countries can flexibly react to asymmetric shocks, as the single monetary regime makes adjustments to asymmetric shocks a painful and drawn-out process.", "In 2000 the European Council adopted the Lisbon Agenda.", "In broad terms, the Lisbon strategy aims to \"make Europe, by 2010, the most

Austria third in the euro area, right behind Luxembourg and Ireland in 2006.", "In addition, average (CPI) inflation fell from approximately 2.7% in the decade before EU membership to some 1.7%
