the single currency eliminates the uncertainty related to exchange rate movements and thus diminishes the risk related to foreign trade.", "However, the estimated scale seems to be much exaggerated.", "One problematic issue is related to the fact that before the eurozone, we did not have examples of currency unions between developed countries.", "So the Rose study was based on data on currency unions involving poor and/ or small countries.", "As noted by Micco, Stein and Ordonez (2003), \"one does not need to be a eurosceptic to wonder whether such findings are directly applicable to Europe's single currency\".", "Follow-up studies (e.g.", "Rose and Wincoop (2001), Kenen (2002), Persson (2001)) attempted to correct the Rose estimates but arrived, rather inconclusively, at anything between a 50% and 150% growth of bilateral trade.", "Recently, the first studies based on euro area data emerged.", "These show that the trade creation effect of the euro was substantial, although (until now) by an order of magnitude smaller that the original Rose estimate (e.g.", "Our knowledge about trade creation effects of the euro is still far from complete and we will probably have to wait another 10+ years to have enough data to draw firm conclusions about its magnitude in the eurozone.", "Now let me move to the cost side.", "As already noted in contrast to the benefits, some costs have a contingent character.", "They are tail-events -

after a negative shock falling wages can help reduce the cost of production and as a consequence prices.", "This will increase demand and help the economy return to equilibrium.", "A crucial prerequisite for this channel to operate smoothly is a flexible labor market -

output will not exceed production capacity and inflation will remain stable (Woodford 2003).", "This is what implicitly or explicitly most inflation targeting central banks are trying to achieve.", "One of the problems with joining a common currency area might be that real interest rates in this area will be lower than the natural rate of the new member.", "Recent research shows that this might be the case for Poland, where the natural rate has remained in the past above the euro area level (Brzoza-Brzezina 2006).", "For Poland entering the eurozone means lower nominal interest rates (the spread on long-term rates remains between 100 and 150 basis points) and higher inflation (due to the catching up process).", "Together this means a drop in real interest rates, which could induce people and enterprises to substantially increase borrowing, and spend the loans on consumption and investment goods.", "What could be the consequences of this?", "First, if borrowing accelerates massively, banks may start granting loans without properly checking their customers' creditworthiness - this could result in bad debt problems.", "It is a well known phenomenon (e.g.", "Demirgu\u0308c\u0327-Kunt, Detragiache 1998, Gourinchas et al.", "2001) that lending booms are often followed by banking sector crises.", "Fortunately recent research on the potential for lending booms in Poland after euro area accession forecasts a rather moderate increase in lending (Schadler et al.", ", Brzoza-Brzezina 2005), and shows that the expected credit growth is rather an equilibrium phenomenon - a structural adjustment that should not have negative consequences (Kiss at al.", "Nevertheless, even if a serious lending boom during euro area accession seems unlikely, policymakers should remain vigilant and prudent banking sector supervision should be the right answer to such worrying developments.", "Second, higher domestic demand can fuel inflation pressure and increase imports, thus leading to a higher current account deficit.", "As to the second phenomenon, it seems that while outside a monetary union deep current account deficits worry investors and can, in extreme situations, lead to currency crises, for countries that have already joined the common currency they do not matter much.", "An example of the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), whose currency board arrangements are close equivalents of a monetary union, shows that enormous current account deficits (9-16% of GDP in 2006) have no apparent negative consequences for the economy.", "The case is, however, different with inflation pressure.", "In theory the margin for local demand-driven price increases in small member states of monetary unions is very narrow.", "This is guaranteed by the so called law of one price - the expectation that the same product should have the same price in various countries of a monetary union.", "In practice, however, there are several obstacles for this law to hold perfectly - some goods cannot be traded, most goods do not have perfect substitutes, there are transportation costs and tax differentials - so local demand pressures can play a role in driving prices in monetary union member states.", "As a consequence, products manufactured in these countries become more expensive and such countries loose competitiveness (e.g.", "It is relatively difficult to foresee how the Polish economy will react to demand pressures once in the euro area.", "However, as in the case of asymmetric shocks, labor market flexibility is probably the best answer to the described phenomena.", "It allows a smooth and relatively painless adjustment if the economy looses competitiveness.", "Summing up, I have discussed selected aspects of the cost-benefit analysis of Poland's adoption of the euro.", "Although the costs may seem substantial, one has to bear in mind two things.", "First, the probability that these costs will have to be incurred is relatively low.", "Second, their magnitude depends crucially on domestic policy -
