and secondly, to generate savings for future generations.", "The rationale for setting aside funds for a rainy day is rather obvious.", "Notwithstanding the surge in oil prices since the turn of the current decade, oil and gas prices are inherently volatile and even the most optimistic projections suggest that, at some time, oil prices will revert to a more normal long term equilibrium level.", "Given our economy's heavy dependence on oil and gas, a sharp fall in prices will affect government revenue and could require a drastic cutback in government spending.", "By putting aside some resources for stabilization, the Government would have the ability to cushion the impact on its spending and consequently on the level of economic activity.", "(Recall the cut in civil servants' salaries in the 1980's.)", "The rationale for setting up a savings fund is a bit more complex and incorporates both economic and ethical considerations.", "It says that natural resources are an exhaustible asset, the benefits of which should be spread over generations.", "And therefore what a savings fund does is to transform the assets under the ground (in our case oil and gas) into a diversified portfolio of financial assets, which can be managed to provide an independent source of foreign exchange income.", "This income will be available to the budget when the oil and gas resources have dwindled or have completely run out.", "Building up the Fund sufficiently and investing it wisely would allow us to preserve the (like keeping the oil in the ground) while living on the interest.", "Future generations will thus be able to enjoy the benefits of oil and gas resources, even when the oil and gas resources are gone.", "The flow of investment income from the Fund could go on for a very long time if you have built up sufficient assets and if the country's fiscal position is sustainable over the long term.", "Many resource-rich countries - both large and small - have seized on the idea that Sovereign Wealth Funds are an important part of economic management.", "The HSF Act approved by Parliament in March of last year, is therefore a most important piece of legislation.", "In line with international best practices, the legislation provides for clear deposit and withdrawal rules;

the withdrawal rule allows the Government to tap into the Fund to cover 60 per cent of any revenue shortfalls.", "There is a cap on the amount of the Fund that could be used for stabilization.", "There are some other significant provisions in the law or in the principles underlying the Fund.", "Thus, for example: HSF deposits are to be invested abroad, with a medium to long term focus;
