significant accomplishment of the Bank has been the containment of inflation within the target range since September 2003.", "This does not imply that the other functions of the Bank are neglected.",

that impact on many of the activities of the Bank.", "This address will highlight, where relevant, some of the salient economic developments which have affected our operations.", "The focus of this address is on the main operational areas of the Bank including monetary policy, monetary operational procedures, gold and foreign exchange reserve management, the national payment system, banking regulation and supervision, international co-operation and internal administration.", "Monetary policy during the past year was conducted against the background of a strongly growing international economy and buoyant commodity prices.", "This strong growth, combined with rising geopolitical tensions and other supply constraints, placed upward pressure on international oil prices, which reached highs of almost US$80 per barrel in recent weeks.", "Despite the high oil prices, world inflation initially remained subdued, but inflationary pressures have since begun to emerge in a number of countries.", "This has prompted the tightening of monetary policy by several central banks in the past few months.", "Domestically, the economy grew by 4,9 per cent in 2005.", "In the first two quarters of 2006, economic growth remained robust but showed some moderation compared to 2005.", "An annualised growth rate of 4,2 per cent was recorded in the first quarter of 2006.", "Inflation

target range of 3 to 6 per cent.", "In the twelve months from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, the year-on-year CPIX inflation rate averaged 4,1 per cent, but changes ranged between 3,5 and 4,8 per cent over the period.", "From March to June 2006, CPIX inflation accelerated from 3,8 per cent to 4,8 per cent.", "Services price inflation continued to decline and had fallen below goods price inflation by the beginning of 2006.", "This was partly a reflection of the continued containment of increases in administered prices, other than petrol prices.", "The higher trend in goods prices was initially mainly due to petrol price increases, and more recently food price increases.", "During the first nine months of 2005, food price inflation averaged 1,8 per cent and therefore contributed to the downward trend in inflation.", "Following the strong increase in maize prices towards the end of 2005, food price inflation began to increase and had risen to 7,2 per cent by June 2006.", "By contrast, the prices of a number of categories of goods fell, particularly clothing and footwear, and furniture.", "Production price inflation increased over the past year and averaged around 5,5 per cent in the first four months of 2006, compared to 2,3 per cent in June 2005.", "However, a further acceleration occurred in May and June 2006, when producer inflation reached levels of 5,9 per cent and 7,5 per cent, respectively.", "Changes in energy and food prices provided much of the impetus to higher production prices.", "For much of the reporting period the inflation outlook was fairly stable and favourable.", "This allowed for an unchanged repo rate of 7 per cent for a prolonged period following the reduction by 50 basis points in April 2005.", "In the past year, there were a number of developments that supported a favourable inflation outcome.", "Lower inflation expectations appeared to have had an impact on wage settlements which have declined steadily.", "Unit labour cost increases were also moderate, with an average rate of increase of 3,4 per cent for 2005, significantly down from the rate of 6,5 per cent recorded in 2004.", "These developments, combined with the increased credibility of monetary policy as indicated by improved inflation expectations, were expected to support sustainable low inflation.", "The inflation outlook was also supported by continued fiscal discipline, output growth in line with growth potential and low world inflation.", "The initial impact of the significant increase in international oil prices on world inflation, world growth and domestic inflation was minimal, confounding earlier fears of a repetition of inflation spirals seen during previous oil price shocks.", "Some of the other determinants of inflation have remained favourable for much of the period, although their associated risk increased over the past year.", "The exchange rate remained within a fairly stable trading range over much of the period.", "However, following increased uncertainties in the international markets from May 2006, the rand came under pressure, along with the currencies of a number of other emerging-market economies.", "The rand exchange rate also reacted further to the publication in June of the first quarter current-account deficit of South Africa.", "Between the beginning of May 2006 and the beginning of August, the trade-weighted exchange rate of the rand depreciated by approximately 14 per cent.", "Despite the positive developments in the inflation outcomes during the past year, there was a steady deterioration in the outlook of a number of the fundamental determinants of inflation, increasing the degree of upside risk to the inflation outlook.", "Of increased concern to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was the continued strength of domestic demand.", "For the past two years, household consumption expenditure has grown at annual real rates of almost 7 per cent.", "Retail sales continued to grow strongly and consumer confidence reached an all-time high by the end of 2005.", "This was fuelled by high rates of credit extension which averaged over 20 per cent during the past year, and resulted in household debt rising to 66 per cent of disposable income in the first quarter of this year.", "The strong growth in expenditure had little immediate impact on domestic inflation, although the MPC noted at its meeting in February 2006 that adverse price effects would be inevitable if these trends continued unabated.", "Increases in consumption expenditure, however, contributed to the progressive widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments from 4,2 per cent of gross domestic product in 2005 to 6,4 per cent in the first quarter of 2006.", "This development was seen by the MPC to pose a potential threat to inflation through its possible impact on the exchange rate, should the deficit be regarded as unsustainable.", "Nevertheless, these deficits were adequately financed by capital inflows.", "The sustained strong domestic demand, combined with threats posed by international oil prices, food prices, and exchange rate developments, increased the risk to the inflation outlook.", "In response to these heightened risks and the deteriorating inflation outlook, the MPC felt that pre-emptive action was required.", "Accordingly, the repo rate was increased by 50 basis points to 7,5 per cent on 8 June 2006 and by a further 50 basis points on 3 August 2006.", "However, future monetary policy decisions will depend on changes in the outlook for inflation and economic developments.", "Monetary operations The Bank uses open-market operations to provide and drain liquidity from the money market in order to maintain the liquidity requirement of banks at a level sufficient for the implementation of monetary policy in line with the stance determined by the MPC.", "Deposits of banks at the Bank in terms of the minimum statutory cash reserve requirement (2,5 per cent of liabilities, as adjusted) amounted to R28,7 billion for the June/July maintenance period.", "As at the end of June 2006, total outstanding debentures on issue by the Bank and longer-term reverse repurchase transactions amounted to R5,4 billion and R2,0 billion, respectively.", "The deposits of the Corporation for Public Deposits with the Bank, which amounted to R11,1 billion at the same date, also contributed to the draining of excess liquidity.", "Notes and coin in circulation also had a contractionary impact on liquidity, increasing from R49,0 billion on 30 June 2005 to R53,9 billion a year later.", "Currency in circulation The daily average value of banknotes in circulation in the period 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006 amounted to R46,3 billion, while the average value of coin in circulation during the same period amounted to approximately R2,7 billion.", "While banknotes in circulation increased by 10,2 per cent over the previous corresponding period, coin in circulation increased by 9,1 per cent.", "A seasonal peak for banknotes and coin in circulation of R57,4 billion was reached on 23 December 2005.", "The demand for coin has shown a substantial increase in the past few months.", "This is particularly the case in respect of the demand for the 5c coin, which shows an increase of approximately 30 per cent, compared to the corresponding previous reporting period.", "The Bank has co-operated with commercial banks in the development of a more efficient and effective integrated national cash management system.", "The improved system has the potential to limit the cash holdings of banks, thereby contributing to a reduction in the cost of cash to the public.", "Gold and foreign exchange reserves The activities of the Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market are aimed at managing domestic money-market liquidity conditions through foreign exchange swaps, servicing the foreign exchange requirements of clients and increasing foreign exchange reserves in a prudent manner when conditions permit.", "The Bank does not aim to influence the exchange rate of the rand, but leaves its determination to the forces of demand and supply in the foreign exchange market.", "The Bank continued to take advantage of favourable market conditions to increase the level of official gold and foreign exchange reserves.", "Over the same period the international liquidity position increased by US$7,79 billion to US$20,19 billion.", "The increase in the level of official reserves has been well received by market participants and rating agencies and has contributed to the improved perception of South Africa's fundamentals by international investors.", "The Bank and the National Treasury co-operate very closely in the process of accumulating reserves.", "In making rand-denominated deposits with the Bank, the National Treasury assists with absorbing the excess liquidity created by the purchases of foreign exchange.", "As at the end of June 2006, government deposits at the Bank, the greater part of which related to this sterilisation initiative, amounted to R36,2 billion.", "The

of June 2006, the internally managed portfolios comprised 81 per cent of gross reserves, with the balance managed externally.", "Internal reserve management capacity and skills have been strengthened significantly through training and skills transfer agreements with external fund managers.", "A securities lending programme was implemented in July 2005.", "In terms of this programme, securities held on behalf of the Bank by a custodian can be used in lending transactions against cash or other high-quality collateral.", "The income and fees generated by this programme help to defray some of the costs incurred as a result of the external fund management programme.", "In April 2005 the National Treasury made a final payment in the form of zero-coupon bonds to the Bank as compensation for losses accumulated over many years in the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account.", "Financial stability As you are aware, the Bank is not the sole custodian of financial system stability, but contributes towards a larger effort involving the government, other regulators and selfregulatory agencies, and financial market participants.", "The activities of the Bank relating to

include accessibility; transparency; security; support for payment, clearing and settlement initiatives of the Southern African Development Community (SADC); and keeping abreast of international developments.", "The monthly value of settlement in the South African Multiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) system amounted to R4,6 trillion in June 2006, or approximately R200 billion per day.", "This includes the settlement of transactions stemming from the equity and bond markets, as well as the rand leg of domestic foreign exchange transactions.", "Approximately 90 per cent of settlement through SAMOS is effected on a real-time basis during the day, while the remaining 10 per cent, which emanates from the retail batch environment, is settled in the evening.", "An upgrade of the SAMOS system,
