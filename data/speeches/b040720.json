K. Whitaker, and is intended to contribute to general economic debate in Ireland.", "The inaugural lecture was given by the President of the European Central Bank, Jean Claude Trichet.", "The Report also includes an article on Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland, a vital component of our recent economic success.", "The study highlights the principal reasons for our success in this area: a stable

policies in place to continue to be an attractive location for Foreign Direct Investment.", "Economic developments Turning now to the economic situation: in the context of a weak, if improving, international environment, the Irish economy performed well, relative to other countries, in 2003.", "The latest official data put GNP growth at 2.8 per cent (GDP, 3.7 per cent).", "There was significant employment growth last year, which contributed to keeping unemployment at a low level - currently 4.4 per cent.", "For 2004, Ireland's growth prospects appear generally good - particularly as the US and East Asia economies improve.", "However, considerable uncertainties remain.", "Global imbalances continue to pose a risk of a sharp adjustment of exchange rates with implications, in particular, for the US dollar/euro exchange rate.", "A second significant uncertainty surrounds oil prices, which continue to be subject to the influence of geo-political tensions in the Middle

levels are already higher than those of our trading partners.", "Looking beyond the next few years to the medium-term, the economy's growth potential is likely to be somewhat lower than in the recent past.", "There are two main reasons for this.", "Firstly, the scope for employment increases is less than in the past, given the earlier large increase in the participation rate and the current low rate of unemployment.", "Secondly, productivity increases over the past decade or so were boosted by structural changes in the economy which involved transferring labour from low to high productivity sectors, notably in the high-technology areas.", "The scale of this cannot be continued in the future.", "This would suggest that growth potential in the medium-term would be at the lower end of the 4

be a worry.", "In May, Ireland's adjusted private sector credit growth rate of 23 per cent was four times the euro-area rate of 5.8 per cent.", "If such divergent rates of increase were to persist,

at the continuing large increases in house prices - currently running at 12 to 13 per cent - especially in the light of the substantial increase in housing supply.", "If the increase in prices were to continue, the risk of a significant correction would increase.", "Monetary policy and the euro area economy Current prospects for the euro area economy are reasonably positive.", "With external demand remaining strong, growth is expected to average 1.7 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2005.", "Largely due to higher oil prices, inflation will be above 2 per cent this year and into the early

future.", "Since our entry into the Eurosystem, there has been a significant change of emphasis in our work, towards a greater focus on Eurosystem responsibilities.", "We have, of course, undergone a major change in our structure and the Strategy gives us the opportunity to clarify our role vis-a\u0300-vis the Financial Services Regulator and to reinforce the cooperation between us in areas of
