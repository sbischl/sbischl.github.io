lead roles in spearheading initiatives that we now see taking shape across our economy today.", "Let me also acknowledge the on-going support of the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP) who were there from the word go when we first started this partnership in November 2009 and again, now, as co-host for this second microfinance workshop.", "Progress of microfinance in Fiji As we all know, microfinance has been recognized in many developing countries around the world as a means to alleviate poverty and generate employment.", "Microfinance contributes to the empowerment of individuals, the development of communities and of the economy.", "It is for this reason that we have all become so passionate about financial inclusion and microfinance.", "We clearly realize the benefits these bring to the welfare of our unbanked, low income and poor people, as well as the overall benefits to the communities and the economy of Fiji.", "At this workshop, the Chairpersons of the respective Working Groups will fully enlighten you on progress being made in their areas.", "However, let me share with you some of the exciting developments over the past fourteen months.", "The commercial banks have now fully established and integrated microfinance into their operations and are conducting microfinance and financial literacy services in villages and communities in the rural and remote areas, as well as in the urban and semi-urban areas.", "Their momentum is being driven by highly capable senior staff, appointed especially for the job.", "In 2010 the banks also joined the RBF, micro finance institutions, Government ministries, PFIP and other stakeholders in three very successful expos held in Ba, Labasa and Suva.", "It was extremely pleasing to see so many people

briefly on some of the challenges that we face in pursuing the development of financial inclusion and microfinance.", "Institutions conducting financial inclusion and microfinance activities in Fiji can face a variety of obstacles in providing effective services to the unbanked.", "Some of these challenges are macro in nature, such as prohibitive economic and investment policies and poor infrastructure.", "Others are more micro and may revolve around the institutions themselves, their approaches towards microfinance and the way they conduct their business.", "Typical challenges institutions may face in extending financial services into the rural and maritime areas in Fiji are poor infrastructure, technology reach and transportation.", "Basic things such as proper roads, shipping routes, power, and communication towers may be lacking.", "These are needed by institutions in order to extend innovative financial services like rural mobile banking, mobile phone money services and EFTPOS banking into the unbanked areas.", "TIN requirements for all persons will need to be better coordinated so as to ensure the unbanked are conveniently able to open bank accounts.", "Developing and extending appropriate and sustainable financial services for clients in this sector can go a long way towards building strong relationships, and instilling brand image in the communities, which could reap enormous returns in the long term.", "Objective of the workshop Ladies and gentlemen, the theme of the workshop this year is \"Extending Financial Services Outreach to the Next Level\".", "While we may say that much has been achieved over the last fourteen months in the area of financial inclusion and microfinance in Fiji, there is still room to do more.", "We have been clearly thrown a challenge by our theme.", "As key stakeholders, we want you to realistically review what has been achieved so far, by the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce, the three Working Groups and by yourselves, that have contributed to this development.", "By the end of this workshop, we need to come up with recommendations of things that can be taken up in the next phase, by developing strategies and action plans, and agreeing on the institutions, and timelines in which, to implement them.", "Again we require your active involvement, commitment and ownership of the strategies and action plans that we will set out here today, to take financial inclusion and microfinance to the next level in Fiji.", "The next level for microfinance - change, innovation and new initiatives This workshop is also an opportunity for us to change, improve, be innovative and come up with new approaches and initiatives that will further extend financial services to the unbanked in the rural, remote and maritime areas, including the unbanked in urban and semi-urban areas.", "I certainly look forward to seeing the action plans and innovative strategies that will come out of this workshop.", "Our action plans should be measurable and achievable and most importantly they should be implemented with commitment.", "There are many microfinance initiatives we can explore and apply in the local context.", "I know that some of you already have innovative plans in the pipeline to take financial services outreach to the next level.", "I look forward to seeing their introduction in the market.", "May I also add that whilst considering microfinance initiatives, it is also important that thought be given to consumer protection of the poor and the unbanked.", "Bad experiences can often deter the very ones that we are trying to help.", "Concluding remarks In closing, it is my hope that we all continue to be passionate in our drive towards greater financial inclusion.", "When
