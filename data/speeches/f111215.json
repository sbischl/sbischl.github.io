African Central Bank when it is set up; but that is far in the distant future.", "Maybe, more immediately, I could draw on his expertise to advise me on how to deal with any recalcitrant bank CEO's

distinguished Guest of Honour: first, our MPC is just over 4 years old; second, Bank management is outnumbered by outsiders; and third, - fait rarissime - two foreigners sit on our MPC as full members.", "But this evening I want to touch on some deeper underlying and worrying issues for the whole economy namely: the impact of the on-going global crisis and our economic prospects.", "First,

West could lecture the South on getting their economic policies straightened out before they could grudgingly extend some much-needed debt-relief.", "\"It's the economy, stupid!\"", "as US President

aristocratic Minister of Foreign Affairs, who on being asked what he did during the Revolution, gave a pithy reply: \"I survived.\"", "And we have survived, too, with scarcely an African country falling into recession, no banks going bust, and the African economy on the up and up.", "In Mauritius we have certainly done better this year than in the previous two years.", "In Africa, the impact of the crisis was felt mainly through the trade channel and the falloff of FDI flows.", "This was exacerbated by loose monetary policy in some countries where, not surprisingly, double-digit inflation was back in Your Bank was under constant pressure to loosen our monetary policy, to depreciate the currency just a little, to accept a little more inflation, allegedly to save jobs and stimulate growth.", "Do you really think we were wrong to resist those siren calls?", "Would you really really have preferred inflation in the high twenties to finish off the year?", "Mauritius fared well among

degradation.", "Otherwise, we shall hand over to our children a country whose famed natural beauty has been sadly overwhelmed by infrastructure and blighted by urbanisation.", "Do we hear the silent cries of those lovely \"flamboyant trees\" - planted by our forefathers, now coming into full flaming bloom, and adding to the season's festive cheer - as they are brought down by chain-saws to make

and over again and expecting different results\".", "I am afraid that if we stick to the beaten path, we would soon be writing our global epitaph: Mauritius -The Home of the Dodo Three major ideas spring to mind here: the regional service hub, innovation and excellence.", "The service centre or hub notion has been bandied around for years: indeed we have so many hubs thrown at us that I am beginning to lose count of the number of wheels on the wagon.", "The other two are vital ingredients which we largely lack: innovation and excellence.", "But what is really missing is an overarching vision of where we want to go and how we are to get there.", "Now the vision does not have to come from Government: there is a great opportunity for the private sector and the NGOs to pick up where we left off with Vision 2020 some fifteen years ago.", "I am sure I am not the only one here tonight who is looking askance at the progressive financialisation of the economy.", "The \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement, which grabbed the headlines this year, and its equally confused copycats elsewhere, seem to speak to the same concern.", "Citizens are in revolt at the excesses of the Lords of Finance paying themselves fat bonuses on the back of recent public sector bailouts while the real economy has tanked, spawning retrenchment, bankruptcies and unemployment.", "The most egregious example is that of a famous bank CEO whose pre-crisis take-home pay was 75 times higher than the average wage: with the crisis, it is a staggering 169 times the average wage.", "He has had a good crisis.", "He must be a very rare diamond indeed.", "But the situation is not all that rare.", "The same scenario is being played out on the home front.", "With the crisis now in its fourth year and placing severe strain on our economic operators, you would have thought that it was in the self-interest of our banks to reduce finance costs for their clients to help them adjust to depressed market conditions and declining profit margins.", "But you would have been wide of the mark.", "Oh, our real our sector operators, especially exporters, are hurting just as much as their competitors elsewhere, and indeed their customers as well.", "Our banks have also had a good crisis.", "Some of them have raised their fees and charges.", "Bank sector profits are running at Rs65 million a day.", "Unlike bankers elsewhere, our bankers are sitting pretty ...laughing all the way to the bank, you might say!", "We do want our banks to be profitable but we do draw the line at supernormal profits.", "Especially at times like these.", "When the lion's share still goes to the lions, we may be asking ourselves a question or two.", "I hope we never see in our island the bank rage which has created such mayhem in the streets of Manhattan and by St Paul's in the city of London.", "Bank bosses, recently bailed out at taxpayers' expense, are increasingly seen as arrogant, greedy, and unrepentant.", "This is now emerging as the staple diet for stand-up comedians like Andy Borowitz, who has fantasized on a letter that might have been sent from the boss of Goldman Sachs to his \"We have taken note of the protests and have asked ourselves 'how we can make money out of them?'", "The answer is the newly launched Goldman Sachs Rage Fund.", "This will invest in firms likely to benefit from social unrest, such as window repairers and makers of police batons.", "For at Goldman we recognize that the capitalist system, as we know it, is circling down the drain, but there's plenty of money to be made on the way down.\"", "This may be a far cry from the situation here in Mauritius, yet.", "I am sure our bankers are not as insensitive as the profit figures would imply.", "The corporate board-rooms concerned should be reminded of their social role and urged to reconnect with reality unless they are keen to stoke discontent: How can we overcome this apparent disconnect?", "To begin with, we must all work to explode the notion that more money, by itself, is the true target of growth.", "It was a wise man who said: \"Money is a good servant but a bad master.\"", "And there is some serious re-thinking to be done \uf0b7 Let us see remuneration relate more to ethics, with greater attention to shareholders, entrepreneurs and high street customers \uf0b7 Let us break the current nexus between managers and their boards \uf0b7 Let us move towards a new vision and diversify the composition of boards, so that profits and high returns do not become an obsession \uf0b7 Let us move towards a vision of banking where financial return is not the only goal and the business and social role of banks is revived \uf0b7 Let us move towards a vision where the interests of banks are more aligned with those of the wider population \uf0b7 Let us together embrace a vision where the business of banking is the business of serving a thriving and just society.", "That is the real test of development Government has a role in mediating, to try to ease the problems of various stakeholders of the economy, to make it easier for them to co-ordinate their actions, and to act as an important arbitrator and facilitator to support the optimal course of action for the economy as a whole.", "But Government only acts on the information available.", "Therefore we need a wideranging process engaging the best people and best ideas in the land to develop the vision for all stakeholders.", "And banks are part of the system; they should not stand apart, turning a blind eye to financial stability and the impact they are having on the real economy.", "If we compare ourselves with Singapore and Hong Kong, the top performers in the small economies, we suffer from structural flaws that are inhibiting our progress.", "I have not seen any positive reaction to the wake-up call from the Global Economic Forum this year and last year.", "Wake-up Mauritius and grasp your future with vision and vigour.", "But now, if I may be permitted a little digression on the demographic time bomb.", "Its fuse is burning steadily, largely un-noticed, with dire consequences if we neglect its import.", "The population in Mauritius over pension age is expected to more than double over the next 15 years, and more than triple over the next 35 years.", "The ratio of people of working age for each person over pension age is expected to fall continuously over the next 35 years from about 7 now, to 2.5 by 2045.", "This demographic time-bomb, which is ticking away relentlessly, has deep significance for our economy, our pension schemes, and our society.", "Dealing with it must be one of the key elements of our future visioning exercise.", "And now to close, I will share with you another of those whimsical laws of nature that define our frailty.", "In the past, for some light diversion, I have taken you in the world of the premier league with the Maradonna law of interest rates.", "Then we moved into the domain of advanced science with Einstein's law of success.", "We came down to the nitty-gritty business of banking with Sutton's Law on why he robbed banks.", "\"Because that's where the money is\", he explained with irrefutable logic.", "Tonight, we make a foray in the world of linguistics.", "There are very important developments there which can change forever our view of bankers.", "For a profession that has done so much for the world as we know it, both good and bad - and perhaps also very bad, the view is gaining ground that the orthography of the word \"banker\" does not do full justice to the complexity of the profession.", "To prevent \"banker\" from being confused with a four-letter word, I understand that a proposal has been made simultaneously to the editors of Webster's and the Oxford English Dictionary in the UK, the guardians of linguistic orthodoxy, to accept an alternative spelling.", "Henceforth, \"banker\" will be spelt \"b-a-n-k-s-t-e-r\"... to rime with gangster.", "Maybe the CEO's which our distinguished visitor, Governor Sanusi, had locked up were this new breed of bankers, spelt with eight letters.", "This inspires me to move an amendment to Sutton's Law to update it to fit the times: if you want to rob banks, make sure you do it before they rob you.", "And so I ask you all to be upstanding, as I propose a toast to Vision 2030, to our distinguished visitor, and to all of you, the economic operators of Mauritius."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
