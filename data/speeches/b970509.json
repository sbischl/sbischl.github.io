needed to fight inflation created uncertainty in the financial markets.", "The Central Bank responded by aiming its monetary policies at achieving and protecting stability in the financial markets instead of aiming them at decreasing the rate of inflation.", "While withholding announcement of its targets for the second half of 1996, the Central Bank implemented a monetary program in keeping

assets shifted from increased domestic assets to increased foreign assets, mainly borrowed.", "The Central Bank considers controlling the increase in domestic assets to be the most important aspect of its monetary program.", "Only by controlling the increase in domestic assets can we keep the increase in Turkish lira liabilities in line with increasing demand.", "The 1994 law requiring the Central Bank to gradually phase out its advances of short-term credit to the Treasury, formerly the main source of domestic assets, has been of great assistance in curbing their increase.", "The continued lowering of this ceiling in coming years will certainly make it much easier for the Central Bank to implement its monetary policy.", "It is my wish that in the near future, the Turkish Central Bank will see this practice abolished altogether, as it has been in other modern central banks.", "The elimination of Central Bank credit to the public sector will go far to create the confidence needed to
