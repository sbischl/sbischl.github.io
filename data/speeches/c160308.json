the global savings glut hypothesis advanced by Ben Bernanke and others at the Fed about a decade ago.", "Whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB will be higher than in the past.", "Prior to the crisis, some research suggested that such episodes were likely to be relatively infrequent and generally short lived.", "The past several years certainly require us to on this issue among economists, but the views to some extent appear to depend on whether the economist making the prediction is an optimist or a pessimist.", "This research includes recent work by Johannsen and Mertens (2015) and Kiley (2015) that uses extensions of the original Laubach and Williams (2003) framework.", "An international perspective on medium-to-long-run real interest rates is provided by U.S. Executive Office of the President (2015).", "Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Hall (2014) discuss the long-lived effects of financial crises on economic performance.", "See also Hamilton and others (2015).", "I have, in addition, drawn on Fischer (forthcoming).", "It is also a major factor explaining the phenomenon of the economy's impressive performance on the jobs front during a period of historically slow growth.", "See also the recent work by Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008); and Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2009).", "reconsider that basic assumption.", "Moreover, recent experience in the United States and other countries has taught us that conducting monetary policy at the effective lower bound is challenging.", "And while unconventional policy tools such as forward guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful and effective, all central banks would prefer a situation with positive interest rates, restoring their ability to use the more traditional interest rate tool of monetary policy.", "The answer to the question \"Will the equilibrium interest rate remain at today's low levels permanently?\"", "is also that we do not know.", "Many of the factors that determine the equilibrium interest rate, particularly productivity growth, are extremely difficult to forecast.", "At present, it looks likely that the equilibrium interest rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future, but there have in the past been both long swings and shortterm changes in what can be thought of as equilibrium real rates.", "Eventually, history will give us the answer.", "But it is critical to emphasize that history's answer will depend also on future policies, monetary and other, notably including fiscal policy.", "Concluding remarks Well, are the answers all different than they were 50 years ago?", "The basic framework we learned a half-century ago remains extremely useful.", "But also yes: Some of the answers are different because they were not on previous exams because the problems they deal with were not evident fifty years ago.", "So the advice to potential policymakers is simple: Learn as much as you can, for most of it will come in useful at some stage of your career; but never forget that identifying what is happening in the economy is essential to your ability to do your job, and for that you need to keep your eyes, your ears, and your mind open, and with regard to your mouth -
