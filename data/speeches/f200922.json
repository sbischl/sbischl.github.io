such as a possible disorderly Brexit - as well as a loss of momentum due to various emerging economic and financial headwinds.", "The appreciation of the euro is one factor that we need to watch closely with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook, particularly at a time when current and expected inflation rates are both very low.", "The sustained appreciation in the external value of the euro has brought about an undesirable tightening of financial conditions and has offset some of the monetary accommodation provided by our measures.", "The services sector, in which momentum has recently slowed somewhat, is another source of concern.", "PMIs for the services sector worsened in August, likely reflecting its high sensitivity to the rise in COVID-19 infections and renewed social distancing measures.", "Expenditure on several consumer services remains exceptionally low, and might be affected further by the deterioration of the public health situation in a number of euro area countries.", "Overall, private consumption in the second quarter of this year was 16.3% below its level at the end of 2019; consumer confidence remains well below its long-term average.", "Concerns also emerge from the labour market.", "Close to five million people lost their jobs in the first half of this year, reversing half of the employment gains since 2013.", "Looking ahead, job and wage uncertainty is likely to remain elevated and give rise to continued precautionary behaviour among households.", "Moreover, credit risk perceived by banks may adversely affect loan supply.", "Together with corporate balance sheet vulnerabilities, weak aggregate demand and ample spare capacity, this is likely to compress investment.", "Against this background, new wage negotiations may lead to weaker outcomes, further entrenching weak inflation dynamics.", "For as long as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across Europe and new restrictions are introduced, it is hard to envisage a strong rebound in consumer sentiment and consumption.", "And for as long as demand remains uncertain, it is hard to see how business confidence can strengthen and investment can fully recover.", "This is not a normal recession, and we will not see a normal recovery without appropriate policies.", "Future policy calibration In these difficult circumstances, our policy must remain forward-looking, and there are two key elements to this.", "First, we need to constantly reassess whether the policy support we are providing and the calibration of our instruments are adequate to address the evolving shocks I have described and to achieve our objective of bringing inflation back to our medium-term aim in a sustained manner.", "If we encounter shocks that compress demand and pose additional threats to price stability, our reaction function is clearly spelled out: a policy response is necessary and forthcoming.", "The second element of a forward-looking policy response relates to how we assess and react to the balance of risks.", "In this respect, the Governing Council's view is that the risks to growth are currently on the downside.", "This expression worries me more today - given the sheer size of the downside risks we face - than it would in less extreme times.", "Moreover, given the disinflationary nature of the COVID-19 shock,[4] the low inflation expectations and the current levels of spare capacity, I consider a surge of inflation in the medium term above our aim just a remote possibility.", "As an example, even in a very benign scenario such as the \"mild\" scenario in the latest ECB staff projections - which assumes a rapid evaporation of the pandemic - inflation would reach 1.8% in 2022.", "Faced with such a sizeable downward skew, there is a strong case for our reaction function to be asymmetric, as the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.", "Against this background, macroeconomic policies - above all monetary and fiscal policies - must remain complementary and the support they provide may be needed for a long time.", "The credit market provides a clear example.", "Our bank lending survey suggests that banks would tighten credit standards considerably if public loan guarantee schemes are not maintained.", "Since there is evidence that these schemes have significantly suppressed the rate of corporate insolvencies, ending them prematurely at a time when even viable companies may face insurmountable financial barriers could lead to a sharp rise in corporate defaults and the associated adverse effects on banks.", "Similar problems would result, mutatis mutandis, from a premature tightening of financial conditions.", "For as long as the growth and inflation outlook are at risk, monetary policy support will have to remain substantial, and if those risks to the outlook rise, our policy impulse will have to rise in tandem.", "EU borrowing in response to the common shock will also be key to avoiding any fiscal cliff effects, through its support to both furlough schemes (SURE[5] ) and the recovery (Next Generation EU).", "Structural policies also have a fundamental role to play.", "Given that the job-rich sectors of the economy are the hardest hit by this crisis (Chart 5), the restructuring of our economies is vital: both to generate higher overall growth rates and to produce more and better jobs in other sectors.", "Employment growth and contraction due to COVID-19 Source: Eurostat.", "Note: Point size denotes the size of the sector (number of persons employed in a given sector in the fourth quarter of 2019).", "This is particularly important for countries with weaker economies and high debt-to-GDP ratios.", "For these countries, the sizeable funding provided at the European level presents a unique opportunity to address concerns of competitiveness and long-term sustainability.", "Growth will be the only solution to the accumulation of public and private debt.", "Our monetary policy response to the pandemic has removed adverse tail risks, preserved very accommodative financial conditions in all parts of the euro area and leveraged complementarity with other policies.", "But the macroeconomic situation remains fragile and uncertain and the projected inflation path is still clearly short of our aim.", "Our policy must therefore remain forward-looking in terms of how we evaluate and recalibrate the amount of policy support needed, and how we assess and react to the balance of risks.", "All macroeconomic policies need to consider the horizon of their measures.", "I am now looking forward to hearing your views.", "Altavilla, C., Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L.
