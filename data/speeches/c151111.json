rate of 2% on average from 2011 to 2013, had declined at a higher rate of 10% in 2014.", "The decline in cheque usage had accelerated to 16% for the first 9 months of this year.", "Consequently, the number of cheques cleared is projected to fall from about 207 million in 2010 to 149 million by the end of 2015.", "If such decline rate is sustained, the target of reducing cheques to 100 million per year by 2020 would be achieved.", "The reduction of about 100 million cheques above saves a minimum of RM300m not taking into account other savings in terms of efficiency and security.", "Similar trend was observed in the number of electronic fund transfer transactions.", "Interbank GIRO (IBG) grew at a higher rate of 36% in 2014 and this strong growth rate was sustained at 36% in the first 9

terminals.", "This would increase the number of payment card terminals from 8 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2014 to 9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2015.", "We envisage that with the implementation of a Market Development Fund by the payment card industry, about RM455 million funds would be used to deploy additional terminals and spur the expansion of the terminal network.", "This strategy would enable the target of 25 terminals per 1,000 inhabitants by 2020 to be achieved.", "Debit card transactions on the other hand, are likely to maintain its double digit growth rate of about 40% in 2015 (39% in

more manually-intensive paper-based payment methods.", "This would enable banks to achieve a lower cost-income ratio, thus enhancing productivity and competitiveness.", "For this to happen, it is critical that, banks should upgrade their management information system (MIS) to fully capture the cost of different payment methods and identify areas with potential for greater operational efficiency.", "In addition, banks should foster better coordination between their respective revenue and cost centres to achieve optimal financial performance.", "This should be complemented with an incentive structure within each bank that not only rewards revenue generation but also cost reduction.", "Payment system infrastructure providers Basic payment infrastructure should be viewed as a form of 'utility services' such as electricity, telephone and broadband lines, where it is regarded as a key enabler for innovation.", "Hence, access to payment infrastructure should be made as open and as affordable as possible.", "The bigger the network of a payment infrastructure, the more value it can bring to its participants in terms of economies of scale and multiplier network effects.", "Payment system infrastructure development should be shared and not be regarded as a competitive tool as investments in this space is expensive and continuous.", "Therefore, payment system infrastructure providers such as MEPS and MyClear should collaborate more effectively to avoid duplication and wastage.", "In addition, MEPS and MyClear should also collaborate and put in place common payment system infrastructure that would benefit all stakeholders.", "The recent collaboration between MEPS and MyClear under the Malaysian Chip Card Specification (MCCS) initiative to migrate the domestic debit card to the Europay-MasterCard-Visa (EMV) standard and contactless feature is a step in the right direction.", "Moving forward, MEPS and MyClear should jointly identify areas for

a tedious affair and a source of much inefficiency.", "Merchants in particular should leverage on e-payments as a means to rationalize their business processes to be more efficient, so that more resources can be directed towards growing their business.", "Merchants should also leverage on the latest payments technology such as the mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) which allows them to leverage on smart devices to accept payment cards on-the-go.", "Consumers on the other hand, should also embrace e-payments to be more efficient and safe by taking advantage of the various incentives provided by the banking industry.", "Opportunities and key priorities for 2016 We have now reached a critical juncture in our migration to e-payments.", "With the enabling environment in place and the encouraging progress recorded for the past five years, emphasis should now be devoted towards implementation and facilitating behavioural change among individuals and businesses.", "We must use as beacon the targets set out in the Financial Sector Blueprint.", "The achievement of such targets would put us on par with other advanced countries and become as competitive as we transition into a high value added and high income economy.", "The support from all relevant stakeholders is needed to ensure that such objective becomes a reality.", "As the catalyst for e-payment growth, the banking and payments industry should explore the possibility of forming strategic alliances with non-traditional partners.", "The recent partnerships between banks and telcos in the roll-out of mPOS are a good example of such new partnership.", "Let me outline the key priorities for the banking and payments industry in the upcoming year of 2016.", "I would like to raise 6 points.", "First, as a group, we need to ensure there is no delay in the key payment card infrastructure projects such as migration to cardholder verification by PIN and the migration to contactless debit cards under the Chip and PIN

of 15% per year similar to that of cheques; v. Fifth, payment system infrastructure providers such as MEPS and MyClear should enhance their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure any payment infrastructure development initiatives would not result in duplication of efforts by the banking system.", "In addition, both MEPS and MyClear should develop medium term roadmap to enhance payment system infrastructure to keep pace with innovation and meet user needs.", "This must be supported by consultation with relevant stakeholders and robust market assessment and cost-benefit analysis; and vi.", "Last but not least, it is critical for the banking and payments industry to maintain confidence in the use of e-payments, Hence, the industry should continuously enhance their risk management measures and security features, and review the effectiveness of their customer education and awareness programs.", "On this note, I wish all of you an engaging and productive forum.", "Please take the opportunity to visit the exhibition booths to find out more on how you can benefit from the various business and payment solutions."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["E-payments", "Payment system", "Financial Sector Blueprint", "Cheque usage", "Debit card transactions", "Banking industry", "Payment card terminals", "Payment system infrastructure", "Collaborative efforts", "Behavioral change"]}
