U.K., Belgium, France and recently Switzerland, have adjusted their model to be more integrated.", "So it would appear self-evident that central banks, given their role as lenders of last resort and their responsibilities in monetary policy and liquidity management, should play a key role in safeguarding financial stability.", "However, the lender of last resort might be the most important backstop during periods of financial turbulences, nevertheless this should not be a \"free lunch\".", "In order to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, central banks should be equipped with a clear and independent macro-prudential mandate and toolbox to assess and mitigate macro-prudential risks at the systemic level.", "This proposal is coherent with the recommendations of the de Larosie\u0300re report which attributed an umbrella role to central banks in the supervisory framework.", "In this regard, it must be assured that national macro-prudential authorities have the flexibility to adjust regulatory requirements over the business cycle.", "Thus, I welcome the Commission's proposal regarding CRD IV in particular, the countercyclical capital buffer.", "However, the macro-prudential regime must find a balance between preserving national flexibility - as the business cycle varies between European countries - and maintaining a level playing field so as not to distort competition within the Single Market.", "As I mentioned, aside from the institutional arrangements, many challenges remain to be resolved.", "The G-20 and the European Commission have taken some initiatives in addressing the regulatory deficiencies highlighted by the crisis.", "These include Basel III, OTC derivatives, the shadow banking system, high frequency trading, central counterparties (CCPs) and crisis resolution mechanisms, etc...", "Such proposals remain at an early stage and still face the challenges of jurisdictional realities.", "Let me now focus on some specific issues that may arise under the new regulatory regime.", "With respect to liquidity, two new instruments have been proposed i.e.", "the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).", "These quantities are intended to improve financial institutions' liquidity risk profiles and the resulting increase in resilience should help to mitigate funding and market liquidity risk.", "In combination with a more robust and efficient supervisory landscape, the new liquidity standards should also help to bolster internal liquidity risk management practices.", "This issue remains crucial as the recent sovereign debt turbulences have increased the level of liquidity pressure experienced by banks.", "At the same time, tensions in foreign currency funding for financial institutions have become acute and it seems to be important that these concerns be addressed within the context of the new regulation.", "Going forward at the national level, the BCL has seen the need to incorporate these ratios into its current risk-based liquidity surveillance framework which relies on a combination of qualitative and quantitative elements.", "In addition, regular on-site visits and continuous off-site monitoring are currently combined with a five day forward-looking liquidity reporting by banks.", "The BCL also sees the need to conduct surveys and studies in order to assess the liquidity situation of financial institutions.", "Indeed, with regard to the new liquidity ratios, an empirical analysis was performed in Luxembourg.", "The results revealed that a one-size fits all approach to liquidity supervision might not be appropriate given the diversity of banks' business models.", "Thus I wonder if it would more useful to complement the focus on financial institutions by taking into account their activities.", "Therefore, a maximum harmonized rulebook, disallowing flexibility on a national level, does not strike the right balance between efficient liquidity surveillance and increased resilience of banks.", "The issue of the maintenance of liquidity buffers at national level for host entities of cross-border banking groups shall deserve particular attention in this regard.", "It is profoundly in the interest of all actors that these new requirements be implemented in a consistent and timely manner.", "During the transitional period however, further analysis is required in order to ensure an appropriate calibration.", "Unintended consequences due to restricting the ability of banks to manage their short and long-term liquidity or to undertake the maturity transformation process which represent the core of financial intermediary activities need to be weighed against the intended benefits.", "Furthermore, care should also be taken to avoid incentivising banks to shift some of their activities to the non-regulated banking system;
