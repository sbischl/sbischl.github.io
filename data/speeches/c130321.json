other historical developments aside - is of course the fact that Ireland and Poland share membership in the European Union; indeed, form the Western and Eastern borders of the Union at the latitude (52\u00b0-53\u00b0N) which Dublin and Warsaw share.", "Poland took the Presidency of the Union for the first time in 2011; this role has rotated now to Ireland which performs it for the seventh time in the 40 years of its membership.", "As you know, during these semesters, each national government, supported by the national administrative structures, seeks to progress the Council's role in the strategic and legislative programme of the Union.", "Poland's effective Presidency, in which you steered the turbulent discussions on economic governance during one of the most pressured episodes of the economic crisis, and secured agreement on reinforcing fiscal coordination through the so-called \"six-pack\" of legislative measures, is recalled as a strikingly successful one.", "Eighteen months later, though the systemic financial crisis of the euro area is less acute, and even if employment growth has resumed in some countries, unemployment at record levels is but the most conspicuous evidence of the depth and persistence of recessionary times in Europe.", "It would be astonishing if institutional deepening and reform in the economic infrastructures of the European Union were not still centre stage in the legislative agenda in 2013 and I can assure you that a large and intensive effort has been mounted by the administrative resources of the Irish economic and financial authorities to try to progress this agenda.", "Before mentioning some of the detailed elements of current legislative debate, let me stand back a bit, though and ask why it is that the Eurosystem has needed a relaunch.", "How come the great expectations for the euro as the single currency of the European Union seem not to have been fully realized?", "Why have some commentators been identifying the euro as a source of weakness rather than strength of the euro area economies, as well of those which, like that of Poland, are intertwined with the euro area (I see, for example, that well over half of Poland's exports go to the euro area)?", "And are the reforms that are currently being discussed of the correct type and sufficient in scale to set things back on the kind of path which was not only expected in advance, but up to the current crisis actually had been achieved in practice, with not only low inflation and anchored inflationary expectations, but also modest and falling debt ratios, convergence of financial market conditions, reasonably steady growth and - notably - a considerable reduction in unemployment?", "In case there is any doubt that a relaunch is needed, it may be useful to note that the key entry-requirement indicators of government debt, government deficit and bond yields now show considerably greater divergence than at entry (even though the entry criteria were applied in a relatively liberal manner.", "But what is needed is not only the kind of fiscal restraint that is clearly a prerequisite for restoring something closer to what was envisaged for these indicators as threshold levels for entry - that is the task of the six-pack and the two-pack legislative measures - but a deeper reform of policy and behaviour to ensure that the divergences do not easily recur, and construction of institutions that will help rebuild trust and confidence both to market participants and to partner countries within and outside the euro area.", "For this, we need to understand what went wrong.", "It is easy to point to the global financial crisis as the culprit, and certainly that crisis, which had its origins in the United States, has had a devastating impact.", "But why have the problems been particularly deep and intractable in the euro area?", "After all, not all euro area countries have been equally affected.", "Germany, to take the largest and most striking example, has emerged from the shocks of the last few years with lower unemployment than before.", "And, as for the most adversely affected countries, the imbalances and excesses which they have experienced have been quite diverse.", "Greece's problems have emerged as the result of large and under-appreciated fiscal deficits, Italy's as a result of high debt and persistent lack of growth dynamism, Ireland from a banking-driven boom-and-bust cycle.", "What is the common feature of these and other syndromes?", "This is important for us in understanding what needs deepening in a relaunch of the system, and it also, of course, is vital for a country contemplating and preparing itself for a future euro membership.", "I believe that the key to this mystery lies in the fact that the euro represents a commitment device, a policy straitjacket which, if accompanied by the behaviour to which the country implicitly and explicitly commits when it joins the currency union, will lead to an improved economic performance relative to what can otherwise be achieved.", "The commitment is of course to policies that retain macroeconomic balance, which requires fiscal discipline, and international competitiveness in both price and non-price dimensions.", "For decades, many European Union countries have had a chequered history of macroeconomic imbalances, generally resolved through devaluations at the cost of relatively high inflation, and high nominal and real interest rates, all of which contributed to growthdamaging uncertainty.", "In addition to the considerable microeconomic benefits of eliminating currency conversion costs and all of the exchange rate risk for intra-euro area transactions, the main advantage of the currency union was seen to be lower inflation and interest rates, contributing to a stable growth platform.", "Yet it was as if policymakers and market participants believed that the results would happen semi-automatically.", "Governments would adopt restrained fiscal policies for fear of market reaction, and if they didn't markets would quickly penalize them with interest penalties that would incentivize them to get back on track.", "Likewise any loss of competitiveness due to wage rates increasing faster than the currency area would result in such quick damage to employment that such divergences would be short-lived.", "Above all, private capital flows could be relied upon to be stabilizing and sustainable.", "With such strong forces for macroeconomic stability, what need for anyone to pay attention to fiscal and cost competitiveness?", "But markets were not as effective task-masters, and they allowed the old pattern of imbalances to persist.", "Indeed, the very fluidity of large-scale international capital flows (partly attributable to the currency union itself, but even more - as can be seen by the parallel experiences of countries such as Iceland and Latvia - by technology-driven liberalization of finance) allowed the imbalances to become larger than ever.", "The difference now was that the old adjustment device - devaluation and inflation - had been eschewed.", "Imbalances, allowed to emerge, had even more costly consequences when those safety valves - imperfect and corrosive though they are - were not available.", "High debt ratios had to be sweated down or, when this was impossible in Greece, in effect written down.", "The needed fiscal contraction removed demand and triggered the double-dip of the recession in several of the most affected countries, and unemployment soared, especially to the extent that the inflexibility of nominal wage rates inhibited needed restoration of costcompetitiveness.", "The solvency of banks, both those in the countries suffering the adjustment, and those which had extended large advances across borders within the currency union, came under suspicion.", "On top of this, the severity of the needed adjustment made markets question the ability of some member states to stick with the single currency - a doubt whose elimination required the invention of the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme.", "In sum, the continued failure to maintain fiscal, cost and financial discipline in some countries, despite the implicit commitment to do so embodied in euro area membership, had much more severe consequences than they had had in the previous decades of autonomous and often weak currencies.", "How can Poland ensure that life in the euro (whenever that comes about) could be accomplished without the mishaps and imbalances that have characterized several euro area countries in the financial crisis?", "I believe that Ireland's experience suggests that this can be done, and that the errors that were made could be avoided without too much difficulty, as long as the commitment required of membership is widely appreciated.", "Thus one would envisage a more decisive response - with macro prudential and fiscal tools - to the big property price and construction boom that made Ireland such a recordbreaker in mid-decade; the degree to which fiscal balance was becoming dependent on boom-time revenues could have been better recognized, and public expenditure kept in check accordingly; finally, if and when things had got to the point of wide scale bank failure, crisis management could have allowed for a lower socialization of the losses.", "In avoiding such pitfalls for the future, the new euro-area institutional arrangements will help, but in fact a well-managed economy has nothing to fear from the euro.", "The consequences of misbehaviour in policy by those who failed to respect the commitment, have not only been for economic performance in stressed countries, but have also spilledover into wider concerns about the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union.", "Cross-border interbank lending dried-up, introducing sizable divergences between the cost of credit in different member states which, though not as wide as they were at one point, have remained substantial and represent a departure from what had come to be expected from the single currency area.", "Credit no longer seems to flow seamlessly across borders without incurring what is de facto a country premium for the stressed countries.", "It is often remarked that this is nothing more than a wholly justified risk-premium that should have been present from the start.", "That could be true for interest charged by the market for lending to Governments.", "But I am not so sure that it holds for non-Government borrowers: it seems to me that this is largely a spillover from fiscal and macro-prudential risks which cannot easily be avoided by firms in stressed countries even if their own firm-specific conditions would not warrant a high risk premium.", "This is not, of course, the only country-specific national source of competitive advantage and disadvantage.", "Tax rates, social benefits, infrastructure, to name just a few.", "So the emergence of interest differentials on lending is not unique.", "But it is a departure from what was envisaged at the outset of the single currency and held out as an important integrating function of the euro.", "And the sudden awakening of market to credit risk on lending to Governments is much more damaging now, when Governments have accumulated so much debt, than if it had been a constant from the outset.", "Stressed countries have naturally turned, not only to the IMF, but also to their partners in the European Union for assistance in these circumstances.", "The countries that have avoided these errors have been called upon to provide financial assistance on a rather large scale to five stressed countries.", "The assistance being granted is in the form of loans, but even so some taxpayers and electorates may fear that their savings are being threatened by being lent where markets have been reluctant to go.", "The fear seems to be that the system is having the effect of spreading the cost of policy errors in some countries to the taxpayers of countries that maintained discipline.", "This fear has been influencing the design of crisis management measures.", "Thus, as is so often the case when it comes to the finances of stressed borrowers; neither the borrower nor the lender is content.", "Herein lies the most fundamental rationale for a relaunch of the euro: the need to ensure collaborative arrangements that command the confidence of both the stressed and the strong.", "That confidence can underpin quicker and more comprehensive crisis management based on a stronger sense of trust, solidarity and common purpose among member states than has yet been fully in evidence.", "The fiscal aspect of the crisis was the first to receive attention from the point of view of reforming and strengthening institutional structures.", "As the successive financial assistance packages to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and now Cyprus have been put in place in conjunction with the IMF to deal with the loss of market access by those countries in the crisis, institutional deepening has also been in the works.", "The initial funding vehicle, the EFSF, has been succeeded by a permanent successor, the ESM, incorporating risk-sharing mechanisms based on mutual national guarantees proportional to the share of ECB capital.", "But that is just one dimension of the fiscal institutional reforms.", "I have already mentioned in passing the progress towards strengthening the surveillance of national policies and economic policy coordination through the adoption of legislative measures: the six-pack under your Presidency and the two-pack under our own, thereby building the fiscal dimension to this concept of closer collaborative arrangements.", "The six - pack greatly reinforces the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact with the possibility of sanctions and stronger powers for the Commission and the two - pack introduces the procedures to allow for meaningful and timely action.", "The Intergovernmental Fiscal Stability Treaty has incorporated the core principles of the Stability and Growth Pact into binding national legislation.", "It was passed by Referendum in Ireland in May 2012 with 60% of the vote.", "As for Poland, I understand that the President of Poland last month gave his assent also to this Treaty.", "But the crisis has above all had at its root, failures in banking and finance, and in the regulation and supervision of banks.", "Faced with the crisis, the ECB has stepped up to the plate with a succession of policy innovations (difficult to design in a multi-country environment) including the open-ended liquidity provision, the long-term refinancing operations, the securities market programme and its successor the OMT, specifically designed to remove redenomination risk.", "These have been non-standard measures designed to improve the transmission of monetary policy and thereby serving to remove obstacles to the accommodating low interest rate policy being effective throughout the euro area.", "Here too (in banking and finance) structural reforms are needed alongside these conjunctural measures, and an institutional strengthening agenda is also being fleshed-out.", "The most immediate part of this agenda at present is the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism for banking based in the ECB.", "Securing agreement on the legal texts that will form the basis of the SSM is high on the action list of the Irish Presidency.", "Would the SSM, had it been in place, have prevented the banking collapse?", "This is a tough question.", "While there is a lot to hope for from centralization of bank supervision - removal of the perception of national political pressures, emotional detachment from the waves of euphoria that occasionally sweep national financial systems, a cross-fertilization of supervisory perspectives from different parts of the Union to name a few aspects - it has to be acknowledged that supervisory failures across the world in the lead-up to the great financial crisis were very widespread.", "Still, not creating a single supervisor was a missed opportunity at the start of the EMU and one which will yield benefits, I am convinced, down the road.", "In the more immediate future, I think its creation is one of the essential ingredients for building confidence in the strong countries that banking weaknesses that have been exposed in the stressed countries are not going to recur or persist because of supervisory inadequacies.", "To be sure, a single resolution authority and a common deposit guarantee system will also be needed in the Banking Union when it is complete.", "The former will build on the current draft legislation on national resolution systems, which is being actively negotiated in this Presidency, and the latter's importance has been underlined, I believe, by some very recent developments.", "Let me describe in a little more detail the progress of discussions in our Presidency.", "As an over-riding theme for this Presidency, Ireland seeks to be seen as \"a recovery country driving recovery in Europe\".", "Thus, we are trying to build on our national experience through considerable domestic efforts for recovery to help consolidate fiscal and economic stability across the European scene.", "Ireland has long entered such endeavours inspired by certain Ireland has always upheld the Community method rather than intergovernmentalism Ireland is strongly commited to working constructively with the European Parliament \u2022 Ireland is a long standing advocate of global institutions and of trade.", "(Recent examples: it is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and chaired the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2012).", "Apart from the financial agenda, among the specific objectives of the current Presidency -
