deploy the financial transactions and processes.", "These are the mechanisms enabling the creation/employment of wealth and for the worldwide distribution of well-being within the constraints and intent of global financial policy.", "Modeling exercises in macroeconomics have been rendered more complex and arduous because of complexities and nonlinearities displayed by behavioral aspects of economic agents.", "The traditional economic models depended heavily on linearization of complex economic behavior expressed in simple mathematical terms.", "Like much of engineering, financial mathematics constructively uses fundamental mathematical and scientific principles with professional practices to yield products and processes.", "Rather than trying to understand the socio-economic interplay of wealth and well-being, financial mathematics considers a flow of cash (the cash-flow): its exchange, its contingency, and its value both in a relative and an absolute sense.", "These could be from the standpoint of the investor (central bank, insurance company, mutual fund, for example), a Wall Street dealer, a global bank, or a hedge fund.", "The flow of cash could be packaged as a stock, bond, option, swap, or exchange of currency.", "Unlike positive sciences like physics and chemistry, one has to take a lot of care when dealing with behavioural sciences like economics and finance.", "Lots of measurement and benchmarking issues come up, particularly, in the modern complex world of business and commerce that await proper quantifications and standardization with precision

uses of mathematics in Central Banking, let me also discuss some challenges/difficulties that the \"use of numbers\" pose in our day-to-day office work vis-a-vis the general perception prevalent in the public domain due to improper interpretation of maths.", "Let me give three examples: a.", "Gold Purchases: You may have come across news reports about the large current account deficit facing the country and the large import of gold being one of the important reasons for this.", "We often hear the argument that people buy gold as a hedge against inflation or that they are investing in a \"safe asset\".", "These people use, or should one say, misuse mathematics to buttress their argument by relying on the figure of gold price appreciation in the recent past.", "However, to me, the data on gold price appreciation is the most convincing argument for why investing in gold is neither a hedge against inflation, nor a safe asset.", "What is the characteristic of a hedge against inflation?", "- it should protect your principal by giving a return slightly above the inflation rate.", "However, the rate of gold price appreciation in the recent past has been far in excess of the inflation rate and, hence, cannot be characterized as a hedge.", "In contrast, it can be termed as speculation against inflation.", "Similarly, the fundamental principal of risk-return trade-off states that greater returns can be achieved only by assuming greater risks.", "The significantly higher returns offered by gold in the past few years only indicates that the risks implicit in investing in gold have also significantly increased.", "Even if we calculate volatility in the gold prices over a longer time horizon, it would be far in excess of that observed in other financial assets.", "Hence, the rationale for investing in gold as a \"safe asset\" is contrary to conventional wisdom of what constitutes a \"safe investment\".", "Mathematics disapproves that gold is a hedge against inflation or that it is a safe asset.", "Unfortunately, this is not fully understood either by investors in gold or even a significant section of opinion makers and policy makers.", "We have no problem if proponents of gold encourage gold purchases by portraying it as a \"speculation against inflation\" or a \"risky investment\" (i.e.", "right use of mathematics) rather than by calling it as a \"hedge against inflation\" or a \"safe investment\" (improper use of mathematics).", "Productivity in Banks: In banks, one of the most commonly used measures of productivity is Business per Employee.", "However, any student of mathematics having some basic understanding of the concept of unit and dimension will say that Business per Employee may be a good measure of productivity across space but a very poor measure of productivity over time.", "If we use this ratio as a measure of productivity over time in banks/financial institutions for deciding manpower issues, viz.", "recruitment of staff, promotions, etc., consequences would not only be erroneous but can also be dangerous.", "Even in deciding on the number of General Managers (GMs) or Executive Directors (EDs) to be provided to banks, policy makers are depending on the volume of business.", "Can we not decide on these issues in a better way by proper use of mathematics, say, based on staff expenses per 100 rupees of asset/ business or salary paid to GMs/EDs as a percentage of total assets/business of banks?", "c. Financial inclusion and numbers: I am sure you have heard of our initiatives towards financial inclusion, the business correspondents, the basic banking accounts, etc.", "Banks often use \"number of accounts\" and \"number of transactions\" as two indicators for measuring progress in financial inclusion.", "It is common for banks to claim progress in financial inclusion stating that the number of accounts opened has gone up by 100% over a period.", "This use of mathematics to claim progress in financial inclusion can be terribly misleading.", "On delving deeper, one realizes that while 100 accounts in the previous period have, indeed, increased to 200 accounts, there is no substantive progress in terms of banking penetration and financial inclusion in real terms, since the total number of villages covered, number of BCs employed, have also increased manifold during the period.", "The increase in number of accounts is, thus, merely a reflection of the expanded geographical coverage and not of any improvement in banking penetration in existing locations.", "Similarly, the number of transactions made per month may have gone up from 50 to 100 but, simultaneously, the total number of accounts may also have gone up from 200 to 1000.", "Thus, this 100% increase in the number of transactions does not indicate an increase in efficiency or deepening of financial inclusion.", "Number of accounts per 1000 population and number of transactions per account are better mathematical ratios to judge the progress in financial inclusion.", "The above three examples that I have given based on my day to day office experience, are only indicative of the irrational choices that could be made, if mathematics, as a decision making tool, is not properly used.", "The students of mathematics must, therefore, be extremely careful as conclusions based on improper use of numbers can lead to adverse policy decisions.", "The key message that I want to convey, particularly to the students, is that not only the past, but also the future of mathematics and mathematicians is glorious and bright.", "While mathematics, in its pure form, is scaling greater heights, the horizons of its applications in various classical and new fields of science are expanding at a fast pace.", "Besides the physical and biological sciences, new applications are found in economics, finance, banking and many other fields.", "In view of such diverse applications of mathematics, the whole world needs mathematicians.", "Internationally, Indian students and scientists are considered to have a reputation in mathematics.", "There is a need to nurture and sustain this natural advantage which will attract bright students to the field of mathematics and also provide them with numerous career options.", "However, in view of the numerous applications of mathematics, students have to identify their areas of interest and develop domain knowledge in that particular area.", "While a career in mathematics research could be pursued by those with a passion for it, others need to focus on building up specialized expertise in their chosen area of application of mathematics.", "While concluding, I would always want you to be like the mathematician in the story that I am going to tell you: A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were traveling through Scotland when they saw a black sheep through the window of the train.", "\"Aha\", says the engineer, \"I see that Scottish sheep are black\".", "\"Hmm\", says the physicist, \"You mean that some Scottish sheep are black\".", "\"No\", says the mathematician, \"All we know is that there is at least one sheep in Scotland, and that at least one side of that one sheep is black!\"", "I would end by once again thanking the organizers for inviting me to this forum which, I am sure, will generate valuable awareness and insight about the prospects for mathematics and mathematicians.", "I have told you so much about maths, its applicability in central banking and problems with numbers that I encounter in my day to day work at the RBI, I hope that all of you will study mathematics, make a name and a great career for yourself.", "I wish you all a bright future and the Conference all success!", "Weisstein, Eric W. \"Hardy-Ramanujan Number\".", "From MathWorld -
