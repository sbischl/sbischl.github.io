the associated concerns that (a) the short-term interest rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound a greater percentage of time in the future than in the past, and (b) that the U.S. economy could find itself having to contend at some point with negative interest rates - something that the Fed has no plans to introduce; the fear that very low interest rates present a threat to financial stability; and concerns that low rates of real wage growth are increasing inequality in the distribution of income.", "Primarily, I believe it is a remarkable, and perhaps underappreciated, achievement that the economy has returned to near-full employment in a relatively short time after the Great Recession, given the historical experience following a financial crisis.", "To be sure, it was a slow and difficult time for many, in part because growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has been slow by historical standards.", "As can be seen in table 1, part of the slower output growth was due to smaller increases in aggregate hours worked, primarily reflecting demographic factors such as the aging of the baby-boom generation.", "But, as shown in table 2, there was also a major decline in the rate of productivity growth - to which I will return shortly.", "Turning briefly to recent developments, the pattern of high employment growth and low productivity growth that we have seen in recent years has continued this year.", "So far in 2016, nonfarm payroll gains have averaged about 185,000 per month - down from last year's pace of 230,000, but still more than enough to represent a continued improvement in labor market conditions.", "Estimates of monthly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady range widely, from around 75,000 per month to 150,000 per month, depending on what happens to labor force participation among other things.", "Output growth has been much less impressive.", "Over the four quarters ending this spring, real GDP is now estimated to have increased only 1-1/4 percent.", "This pace likely understates the underlying momentum in aggregate demand, in part because of a sizable inventory correction that began early last year; even so, GDP growth has been mediocre at best.", "The combination of strong job gains and mediocre GDP growth has resulted in exceptionally slow labor productivity growth.", "Most recently, business-sector productivity is reported to have declined for the past three quarters, its worst performance since 1979.", "Granted, productivity growth is often quite volatile from quarter to quarter, both because of difficulties in measuring output and hours and because other transitory factors may affect productivity.", "But looking at the past decade, productivity growth has been lackluster by post-World War II standards.", "A 1-1/4 percentage point slowdown in productivity growth is a massive change, one that, if it were to persist, would have wide-ranging consequences for employment, wage growth, and economic policy more broadly.", "For example, the frustratingly slow pace of real wage gains seen during the recent expansion likely partly reflects the slow growth in productivity.", "Let me highlight a few topics from the growing volume of research on this topic.", "The first is that the productivity slowdown reflects mismeasurement, because the official statistics have failed to capture new and better products or properly account for changes in prices over time.", "Given how often we meet new technologies in our daily activities, even in classes of products that have been in operation for many years - from driving an automobile, to flying, to medicines and medical equipment, to our communications, and far more - it is easy to persuade ourselves that technological advances play a major part in improving our lives.", "However, some of these gains are conceptually outside the scope of GDP, and most recent research suggests that mismeasurement of output cannot account for much of the productivity slowdown.", "An alternative explanation is that productivity growth has been slow because wage growth has been slow; that is, faced with only tepid rises in labor costs, firms have had less incentive to invest in labor-saving technologies.", "See, for example, David Byrne and Carol Corrado (2016), \"ICT Prices and ICT Services: What Do They Tell Us about Productivity and Technology?", "(PDF)\" Economics Program Working Paper Series 16-05 (New York: Conference Board, May;
