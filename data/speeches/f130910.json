asset quality review, and a stress test.", "The exercise will also cover other relevant aspects of banks' business, including leverage, corporate governance and organization.", "The comprehensive assessment is designed to make sure that the area's main banks are managed in a sound and prudent manner, helping to dispel market concerns over their soundness and risk profiles.", "Significantly, from the outset the assessment will also foster confidence in the SSM itself, reinforcing mutual trust among participating countries.", "It will therefore be a fundamental step in normalizing wholesale markets and restoring the banking system to its principal, fundamental role of supporting economic activity and growth.", "In order to attain these objectives, the comprehensive assessment must be completely transparent, as regards not only results but also process and methodologies.", "The appropriate involvement of external reviewers may enhance the credibility of the exercise.", "Attention must obviously be paid to potential conflicts of interest and problems of confidentiality.", "Also, level-playing-field issues among participating banks must be avoided.", "The design of the balance-sheet assessment must recognize that national accounting and supervisory practices differ radically, especially in the definition and measurement of non- performing loans (NPLs).", "The European Banking Authority (EBA) is working to make definitions uniform across systems and has recently issued a consultation paper on the matter.", "This is a step in the right direction and should be finalized in time for its results to be used for the BSA.", "In any case, the BSA requires a de facto harmonization of NPL definitions.", "National practices also differ substantially in the measurement of risk-weighted assets, the denominator of regulatory capital ratios.", "Differences in the models used by banks to compute capital requirements - or in the approaches adopted by supervisors for validating them - may undermine the comparability of banks' capital, so the BSA will have to pay close attention to the way in which these models compute the risk weights of different categories of assets, including off-balance-sheet items and \"level 3\" assets (non-traded assets whose fair value is estimated through internal models).", "Again in this case, de facto harmonization is necessary.", "Furthermore, in order to be fully credible and to be perceived as a confidence-building exercise the comprehensive assessment must be rigorously designed and carried out, with clearly defined and well motivated thresholds for gauging any capital shortfalls.", "If, as observed earlier, one of the objectives of the Banking Union is to break the perverse feedback loop between banks and sovereigns, then an essential prerequisite is the presence of adequate backstops against the capital shortfalls that may emerge from the BSA.", "Also, to avoid pro-cyclical effects, clear and extensive communication of the process and its results is necessary.", "The mistakes of the past in the sequence of the actions taken by different policy makers should not be repeated.", "... and a perspective on the Italian banking system The Italian banking system offers a few illuminating examples of the problems and challenges of the comprehensive assessment.", "In the international comparison Italian banks appear to have a high NPL ratio and a low coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of loan loss provisions to gross non-performing loans).", "But it is clear by now that the comparison is vitiated by disparities in accounting and supervisory practices, which must be taken into account in order to obtain a fair assessment.", "A case in point is the treatment of collateralized loans.", "Some major European banks do not classify fully collateralized loans as NPLs, while in Italy loans are classified on the basis of the borrower's creditworthiness, irrespective of collateral or guarantees.", "Both practices are fully consistent with international accounting standards enforced in Europe, but the Italian method makes the bank's balance sheet more transparent for investors.", "If Italian banks used the same definition as some foreign banks, their stock of non-performing loans would fall by about a third, decreasing their average NPL ratio significantly and raising their coverage ratio; at the same time, the rise in the NPL ratio in the recent years would be less accentuated, reflecting the sharp increase in collateral demanded by Italian banks in reaction to the deteriorating economic outlook.", "Let me be clear: I am not suggesting a relaxation of the Italian definition of NPLs - which, by the way, is broadly in line with the one proposed in the EBA consultation paper.", "I am arguing that the BSA needs to take this and other sources of heterogeneity into account.", "Similar considerations apply to leverage.", "Italian banks have lower leverage than their international competitors, partly because of their relatively small volume of business in derivatives.", "Arguably, their operational risks are also comparatively low: Italian banks have not been involved in any of the serious episodes of malpractice or the market-rigging schemes that have damaged the reputation and of some foreign intermediaries and cost them expensive legal settlements.", "These and other sources of heterogeneity, which tend to bias international comparisons against Italian banks, have been documented by the Bank of Italy in its Financial Stability Report as well as by market analysis.", "They will have to be duly taken into account in the comprehensive assessment.", "These arguments are intended simply to support a fair approach to the forthcoming BSA; they are not meant to downplay the risks that the Italian banking system faces.", "While Italian banks have demonstrated good resilience overall, thanks to their sound fundamentals at the outset of the financial crisis, the sovereign crisis and two long and deep recessions have put their balance sheets under severe stress.", "NPLs have been rising steadily since 2008, depressing profitability and raising concerns over provisioning among analysts and market operators.", "And even though I have set out the reasons why we need to quickly enhance comparability among European banks, we take these concerns seriously.", "Indeed, we have taken decisive action to address these risks, and we are confident that this will improve the outlook for the Italian credit market.", "Apart from episodes of malfeasance, which are relevant but circumscribed, serious difficulties mainly concern a handful of medium-sized and small banking groups.", "This class of banks has been particularly hard-hit by the recession, owing among other things to lesser diversification of risks and revenues.", "Additional challenges have sometimes been raised by weak ownership and corporate governance structures, which may complicate capital strengthening and adaptation of business models.", "Intense supervisory actions have been - and continue to be - taken on these banks.", "In some instances special administration has been necessary to allow a clear recovery and return rapidly to ordinary management.", "The Bank of Italy regularly reviews banks' asset quality as part of its standard supervisory activity, assessing the risk exposure of each institution.", "The quality of banks' assets is assessed continuously off-site, on the basis of detailed monthly supervisory reports.", "In particular, the information contained in the Central Credit Register includes the exposure of each bank to each individual firm: this enables us to assess the consistency of the different banks' classifications of the same borrower, checking that non-performing debtors are not classified as performing by some intermediaries.", "Moreover, the Bank of Italy monitors the adequacy of loan classification criteria through extensive on-site inspections, among other things in order to curb the forbearance risk typical of economic slowdowns.", "In the second half of last year, against the backdrop of an exceptional and largely unanticipated macroeconomic deterioration, the Bank of Italy launched an ad hoc supervisory review of the adequacy of banks' NPL provisioning policies.", "This involved simultaneous on-site inspections at 20 large and medium-sized banking groups whose coverage ratios either were lower than average or had fallen significantly.", "The main findings were published in a note posted on our website.", "Overall, the coverage ratio for the entire NPL portfolio of the 20 groups rose from 41 to 43 per cent between June and December 2012, notwithstanding the sharp rise in NPLs themselves (the denominator of the ratio) in the same period.", "In other words, the downward trend in coverage ratios since the beginning of the crisis (2007-08) has come to a halt.", "The intelligence gathered in the course of the review will also be used for the application of second-pillar capital add-ons.", "Our supervisory action continues.", "We are closely monitoring the implementation of the corrective measures that the banks were asked to adopt, while assessment of banks' asset quality and provisioning levels is still ongoing and has been extended to other banking groups in the course of regular on-site inspections.", "Any capital shortfalls that may emerge will have to be met through proper actions within the banks' perimeter of decisions and with recourse to the market.", "At the same time, we are taking care to minimize the pro-cyclical impact of banks' actions on the availability of credit to the economy.", "This is why we have called on banks to increase their internally generated resources by curbing operating costs as well as dividends and executive and directors' compensation.", "Our current assessment is that notwithstanding specific difficulties, the challenge will be met and market concerns will abate.", "But the state of the banking system is not independent of the general economic environment.", "Action to revitalize the Italian economy and raise its growth potential is thus as important as ever.", "The move to the SSM must not blur our focus on the conditions of the banking system.", "Supervisory standards and practices must be kept at the highest level of quality.", "This will permit us to perform a homogenous and comprehensive assessment of euro-area banks, with full disclosure of differences in business models but also with a common mandate to build on existing strengths and to counter and shrink the areas of weakness.", "The crisis has constituted a fierce challenge for the European construction.", "The threat of a break-up of the euro, never taken seriously by the markets before, increasingly distorted asset prices across the euro area.", "The economic and social costs have been severe.", "Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, has soared.", "In the worst-hit countries poverty levels have risen sharply, and social tensions have surfaced.", "The responsible reaction of national and European authorities has averted the worst.", "The recovery is now at hand, but downside risks remain significant.", "If we are to seize the opportunity, we cannot relax our efforts.", "Ultimately, our economies must restructure to become more competitive in order to rise to the challenges of technological, demographic and geopolitical change.", "We must press on with structural reform.", "The key to success will be a shared determination to advance towards a fully fledged European Union.", "In the current stage, the test of our resolve is the building of an effective Banking Union."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
