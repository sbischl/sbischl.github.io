{"sentences": ["Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour to be with you today, in the occasion of the Annual Dinner of the Society of Business Economists, in front of such a distinguished audience.", "I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the successful launch of the notes and coins on 1st January 2002.", "I am happy to have an opportunity to present my views on the successful set-up of the euro, on the economic and financial integration of Europe and on the challenges that the euro-zone has to cope with.", "The Euro: built on a successful set-up Set-up of the Eurosystem The single monetary policy is formulated and implemented within a sound institutional framework, the Eurosystem, comprising the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area.", "Three principles are shaping up the Eurosystem: independence, transparency and decentralisation.", "The independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty.", "When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body.", "Independence means institutional, operational and financial independence.", "We consider that comprehensive concept as an essential contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy.", "Transparency and communication: elected authorities, key economic players, as well as all citizens must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy.", "At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as national central banks do with national institutions.", "The ECB was maybe the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1st January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy.", "Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conferences.", "The independence of a central bank and its democratic accountability are two sides of the same coin.", "In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the president of the European Central Bank and by the Governors of national central Banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are significant, and an important part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council.", "Lastly, decentralisation: as the subsidiarity principle underlies the whole European construction, decentralisation is a major principle guiding the architecture of the Eurosystem.", "The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co-operation, and the team spirit is really strong and fruitful.", "Monetary policy decisions are taken, at the centre, by the Governing Council, but are implemented by the national central banks in a closely co-ordinated way.", "Strategy of the single monetary policy The Maastricht Treaty clearly defines the ultimate objective of the single monetary policy, that is to say maintaining price stability.", "However, for this it is essential to have a clear definition of price stability: we define it as a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of below 2% in the whole euro area.", "Bearing in mind this objective, our monetary policy strategy is based on two \"pillars\".", "We have first assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3.", "This \"pillar\" is based on a reference value which we set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3.", "The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term.", "Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the economy, the evolution of government finance and capital flows with the rest of the world.", "However, it is common sense to say that monetary developments alone do not allow for a comprehensive assessment of the risks to price stability.", "This is why we have defined a second \"pillar\" for our monetary policy strategy, consisting of a broad range of variables that act as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments.", "In fact, we consider the maintenance of price stability over the medium term to be the Eurosystem's greatest contribution to fostering an environment which is favourable to sustainable growth and employment in the longer run.", "And, it is also its greatest contribution to limiting unnecessary volatility of output and employment in the short run.", "The relatively low yields on long-term euro-denominated bonds confirm investors' confidence in the new currency.", "This was not the case four or five years ago, before the setting up of the euro, when financial markets were convinced that the euro would be the weighted arithmetic mean of its legacy currencies and would not inherit the level of confidence and credibility of the strongest of these, such as the Deutsche mark, the Dutch guilder, or the French franc.", "The euro has actually been founded on a benchmarking principle, not on a convergence towards an average.", "That may explain why the euro's interest rates were the lowest in Europe from the outset.", "Successful technical framework However, even the best monetary strategy needs an efficient technical framework.", "The launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has also been an indisputable success from a technical point of view.", "In this respect, three points are worth mentioning: the monetary policy framework contains a wide set of instruments chosen with a view to observing the principles of market orientation, equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency.", "The decentralisation of the operations of national central banks has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth functioning of the framework.", "Maintaining a close contact between commercial banks and their national central banks has helped the financial markets to quickly adopt the harmonised practices relating to open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems.", "operational efficiency is highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; the Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days after the tragic events of 11th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly functioning of the European financial markets.", "security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-a\u0300-vis large-value payments.", "The inter-bank market became integrated thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of largevalue payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries.", "Let me turn now to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, which has been the last step of a now more-than-twenty-year process of monetary integration.", "The euro changeover On 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins were issued and became legal tender in the countries participating in the euro area.", "This is a unique and highly symbolic event for Europe.", "As regard France, in 2001, and the rapid introduction the early changeover of non-cash payments of banknotes and coins in euro in early 2002, proved to be a success and entirely in line with the scenarios devised in consultation with all the involved parties (the banking sector, cash-in-transit companies, the Police and the Army, retailers and the general public).", "In France, almost 70% of non-cash payments were in euro at the end of December 2001.", "Since 1 January, all transactions have been conducted in euro, and no major incidents came to light, thanks to the early use of non-cash payments by the general public throughout the second half of 2001.", "This was also a key factor in the rapid acceptance of the banknotes and coins by the public.", "Similar success has been witnessed in all European countries, thanks to national efforts and the co-ordination by the European Commission and the Eurosystem; a month and a half after the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, more than 95% of cash transactions in the euro area are now being carried out in euro.", "Although the practical changeover to the euro might be considered as an outstanding achievement, we should nevertheless remain vigilant on the following issues: First, price stability.", "Although some increases in prices of a certain number of consumer goods have been reported, it is likely that, overall, the effect on price stability will be marginal.", "But consumers have to be vigilant, companies and retailers must remain responsible as regards price setting, and competition will play its part in lowering the prices in the short-to-medium term.", "Second, we must closely monitor the risks of counterfeiting of notes and coins : the communication campaign of the Eurosystem \"The euro.", "Our money\" was aimed at familiarising all the European citizens with their new banknotes and coins (and their security features) and, by doing so, it helped them to easily identify the obviously fake banknotes.", "All institutions concerned, both national and European, are co-operating closely to prevent and fight counterfeiting.", "The credibility of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy, and the successful changeover to the euro are a major achievement.", "They certainly contribute to the efficient functioning of EMU and to European economic and financial integration, as I will explain now."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
