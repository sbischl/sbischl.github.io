now than they were in autumn 2008.", "In addition, housing wealth has improved as a result of higher house prices, which may underpin growth in consumer spending.", "We have limited experience to indicate how the interest rate at the current low level will affect output and prices over time.", "If growth in household demand proves to be stronger than expected, the interest rate may be raised to a higher level and more rapidly than currently envisaged.", "Fiscal policy is expansionary this year, and according to the National Budget for 2010, fiscal policy will provide further, albeit

in a lower interest rate and a weaker krone than projected.", "Unemployment is high in many countries.", "Unemployment in Norway has not risen as sharply as previously projected.", "The number of registered unemployed was 2.8 per cent of the labour force in October, unchanged from September.", "This is very low compared with other countries.", "The decline in employment has been less marked than the fall in activity would imply.", "Unemployment may be low partly because it may have taken time for enterprises to adapt their workforces to the sharp fall in production, and partly because some enterprises have decided to maintain their workforces in anticipation of a pickup in demand.", "In many sectors, the level of employment is nevertheless high in relation to output, and productivity in the past year has been at its lowest level since 1988.", "The projections are based on the assumption that productivity will gradually improve, reducing the pressure on firms' costs somewhat.", "The projections are also based on improved profitability through an increase in prices.", "If firms instead reduce employment more rapidly and markedly in order to improve productivity, that will lead to higher unemployment and lower wage and price inflation than projected.", "The interest rate may then be kept lower for a longer period than currently envisaged in order to ensure that inflation returns to target.", "Wage growth is projected to decrease to around 4 per cent in 2009.", "Weak manufacturing profitability as a result of both a fall in product prices and a low productivity level suggest moderate wage growth ahead.", "At the same time, wage growth among trading partners is low.", "As a result, the competitiveness of internationally exposed industries may weaken further in the period ahead.", "In isolation, this may contribute to curbing wage growth.", "On the other hand, continued relatively low unemployment in Norway will contribute to pushing up wage growth.", "Wage growth is projected to increase to 41\u20444 per cent in 2010, rising further to 43\u20444 per cent towards the end of the projection period.", "The severe cyclical downturn and the decline in commodity prices have resulted in very low consumer price inflation in many countries.", "The year-on-year change in consumer prices is negative in the US, the euro area, Sweden, Japan and China.", "Core inflation is more stable, but has also edged down recently.", "Moderate growth prospects and lower-than-normal capacity utilisation in most advanced economies will lead to low consumer price inflation among our main trading partners throughout the projection period.", "The key policy rate was reduced to prevent inflation from falling too far below target and to mitigate the impact of the global downturn on the Norwegian economy.", "Underlying consumer price inflation in Norway has slowed in recent months to an estimated rate of just below 21\u20442 per cent, reflecting the effects of lower wage growth, reduced capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy and low inflation abroad.", "Although the krone depreciation last autumn has pushed up import prices, the effect of the depreciation is probably now waning.", "After a period of falling productivity, unit labour costs are high.", "The projections are based on an increase in firms' margins ahead through an increase in prices.", "Inflation will nevertheless be curbed by slower wage growth from 2008 and a gradual rise in productivity growth.", "Somewhat further ahead higher wage growth will push up the rise in prices.", "The krone exchange rate has appreciated from weak levels.", "Combined with the fall in prices for imported consumer goods measured in foreign currency, this will push down the rise in prices for consumer goods in the short term.", "Consumer price inflation is expected to fall to somewhat below 2 per cent in 2010, and then gradually pick up to around 2.5 per cent towards the end of the projection period.", "Interest rates are low, resulting in renewed growth in household consumption.", "At the same time, house prices are rising.", "Over time, household borrowing may surge again and saving may fall.", "With low productivity, higher corporate costs, growth in household demand and higher capacity utilisation, inflation may gradually become too high.", "This would indicate that the interest rate should be raised.", "On the other hand, a marked increase in the interest rate in Norway and a wider interest rate differential between Norway and other countries may entail a risk of a stronger-thanprojected krone, resulting in an inflation level that is too low.", "This would indicate that the interest rate should not be raised too rapidly.", "Monetary policy cannot fine-tune developments in the economy, but it can mitigate the most severe effects when the economy is exposed to shocks.", "Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks suggest that the key policy rate should be gradually increased in the period ahead.", "New information may reveal aspects of economic developments that suggest the Norwegian economy is following a different path than projected.", "Higher capacity utilisation or a weaker krone may, on the one hand, result in higher-than-projected inflation.", "On the other hand, inflation may be lower than projected if the krone remains strong or productivity picks up more rapidly.", "Should the krone appreciate considerably more than projected, the interest rate may be increased to a lesser extent or later than currently envisaged.", "The key policy rate should be in the interval 11\u20444-21\u20444 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 24 March 2010 unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none",
