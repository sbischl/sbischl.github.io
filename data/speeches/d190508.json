areas.", "This literature identifies a rich range of factors important for determining the optimal spatial dimension of policy.", "From that long list, let me highlight three factors which are commonly found to play a crucial role: (a) Heterogeneity and Specialisation Other things equal, the greater are the differences in the economic characteristics of an area, the stronger is the case for recognising these differences in the setting of economic policy.", "These economic characteristics include: the cultural and political preferences of citizens; economic fluctuations over the business cycle; and structural features of the economy, such as industrial composition and policy transmission.", "A related aspect is the degree of specialisation or comparative advantage in an economic area.", "The greater this degree of specialism or comparative advantage, the stronger the case for having it recognised and supported in the setting of economic policy.", "Specialisation is one of the ways in which an economic area can harvest the benefits of economies of scale and scope through the agglomeration multiplier.", "On the face of it, there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity across the UK, including in terms of income, wealth, health and happiness.", "Other things equal, this would support locally-targeted policy interventions.", "At the same time, those differences are often as large locally as they are regionally.", "That suggests a very decentralised setting of policy would be needed, which may come with costs.", "(b) Diversity and Risk-Sharing One of the most important of those costs is the loss of risk-sharing.", "A diverse economic area allows aggregate fluctuations to be smoothed-out, in the same way a diverse portfolio of assets smooths out returns to an investor.", "And by smoothing-out aggregate fluctuations, diverse economic areas can help smooth out local fluctuations by transferring resources between regions to insure against region-specific shocks.", "Another set of factors weighing in the same direction are economies of scale and scope.", "The smaller the geographic area, the lower the potential for agglomeration effects.", "Some of these agglomeration benefits may themselves arise from having a diverse economic eco-system, as this enables positive spillovers between sectors and skills within an area.", "For example, Berger, Dell'Ariccia and Obstfeld (2018).", "Alesina, Tabellini and Trebbi (2017).", "(c) Factor Mobility A third sector of factors influencing the choice of optimal policy area concerns the degree of factor mobility.", "Easy movement of factors between regions can smooth-out differences between regions.", "For example, people moving from low to high unemployment areas can smooth out regional differences in incomes.", "In this way, factor mobility can serve as a risk-sharing device between areas, even without policy intervention.", "The other side of this coin is that, people and money do not always flow in this direction.", "Factor mobility can sometimes increase, rather than smooth out, differences between regions.", "For example, people or firms may move to areas which offer strong existing incomes and jobs.", "If so, this will tend to amplify, not ameliorate, regional differences.", "The optimal policy strategy involves balancing these factors, based on the structural characteristics of an economy, its degree of diversity versus specialism and the flows of factors within it.", "A digital twin of the economy, of the type outlined earlier, would embody these factors and flows and would provide a quantitative test-bed for making policy choices.", "In the absence of such a model, let me discuss two examples where existing data and analytical tools could be used to inform policy choices.", "In line with theory, the first looks at flows of factors within a region, the second at structural economic characteristics across regions.", "These data and techniques can be used to shed light on policies which might boost economic growth, locally or nationally, in line with the UK Government's industrial strategy.", "My first example draws inspiration from recent work by Tom Forth at the Open Data Institute in Leeds, on behalf of the Productivity Insights Network (PIN) here at the University.", "This uses data on flows of people to assess local growth prospects.", "The story starts with the observation that many UK cities appear to punch below their demographic weight in income terms.", "Put differently, a number of UK cities do not appear to benefit as much as their international counterparts from agglomeration effects.", "To demonstrate, Chart 22 plots (log) city population size against GDP per head in 563 cities in advanced economies around the world, including a number of UK cities.", "It also shows a line of best fit.", "This is upward-sloping and statistically significant, consistent with agglomeration effects.", "Moving from a city the size of Oxford

part of the explanation.", "By analysing commuting times into Birmingham at different times of the day, he provide a measure of the \"effective\" working population.", "At peak times, the effective working population of Birmingham is perhaps 50% smaller than its measured population due to poor transport infrastructure.", "This helps explain why Birmingham punches below its demographic weight.", "This is a terrific example of how high-resolution data can be used to understand local patterns of economic growth.", "The same data could be used to analyse the \"effective\" working population in other UK perhaps helping explain their under-performance.", "It could also be used to answer industrial strategy questions, such as what impact new transport routes have on the effective working population of the UK's major cities and hence on their incomes through agglomeration effects.", "Imagine a transport strategy whose aim was to raise the effective working population of those UK cities currently operating below the line.", "Using Chart 22, doing so would raise UK GDP per head by around 10% in today's money.", "Those or around $4,100 (\u00a33,100) annual benefits could be compared with the one-off as part of the UK's industrial costs of investment to determine the desirability of such a policy, strategy.", "My second example draws inspiration from recent work at the University of Cambridge by Penny Mealy, including by my colleague on the Industrial Strategy Council Diane Coyle.", "This looks at the structural economic characteristics of different regions and provides a way of summarising and ranking them.", "The does so is by measuring their \"economic complexity\", following the work of particular way it Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) in the context of international trade.", "Without going into the technicalities, the complexity index can loosely be thought of as weighing the two structural characteristics of an economic area which theory would suggest are crucial for economic success.", "The first is the degree of specialism or comparative advantage in a particular product or industry: the greater this specialism, the greater complexity.", "The second

itself complex, the principles underlying it are not.", "An economic area exhibits complexity when it has a diverse set of highly-specialised industries.", "This description sets out a stylised interpretation of ECIs as they were originally conceived by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009).", "Recent work by Mealy, Farmer and Teytelboyn (2019), however, has re-assessed the interpretation of ECIs and found that diversity is mathematically orthogonal to ECIs.", "In this new interpretation, ECIs instead provide a useful way to understand place-based similarly in industrial specialisations.", "area lacking complexity has few or no industries or products which are specialised.", "ECIs have been constructed at the nation-state level and, more recently, at the local level in the US and UK.", "One of the interesting features of these empirical ECIs is that they appear to match the theory: the greater the degree of specialisation and diversity, and the higher the ECI, the better the economic outcome.", "One rationale for this finding, proposed by Hidalgo and Hausmann, is that ECIs serve as a proxy of the degree of knowledge embedded in an economic area, knowledge that comes courtesy of specialisation and diversity.", "Charts 23 and 24 plot local authority level ECIs against measures of income per head and hourly earnings in the UK.", "They show a positive, statistically significant relationship.", "The same has been found at national level and among US states.", "The embodied-knowledge effect is, on the face of it, an empirically strong one.", "In a bivariate regression, ECIs
