One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; ... the business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations\".", "Smith describes seeing a small factory of this kind in which the daily output of pins was almost 5,000 for each person employed.", "The division of labour permits \"this great increase of the quantity of work\".", "But the higher living standards which the division of labour permits require institutions that allow us to exchange what we each produce.", "Smith described how \"in a nation of hunters, if any one has a talent for making bows and arrows better than his neighbours he will at first make presents of them, and in return get presents of their game\".", "But a man who spends all day making arrows to swap them for meat gives up the chance of hunting himself for the chance of sharing in a larger catch.", "For the group to specialise, the hunter who turns arrow-maker has to be sure that his partner in trade will deliver the \"present\" of meat.", "When the timing of these exchanges is not coincident, there is a need for social institutions to prevent one party reneging on the transaction, and, in particular, for money - an issue that I will return to later.", "Smith's second insight was that the social institutions necessary to exploit the full potential of a market economy were not derived from the relentless pursuit of selfinterest, but from the recognition that we Theory of Moral Sentiments all benefit from what he described in as the exercise of \"sympathy\".", "In other words, we step back from our immediate situation and ask: how do my actions affect others?", "Answering that requires an ability to imagine ourselves in others' shoes - \"sympathy\".", "That sympathy in the hunter, for example, might mean feeling the pain of a starving arrow-maker.", "Smith argued that we \"are endowed with not only a desire of being approved of, but with a desire of being what ought to be approved of...\".", "He talked about an \"impartial spectator\" whose judgment we imagined and imposed as a constraint on our behaviour.", "Smith thought the \"impartial spectator\" fundamental to an orderly and prosperous society.", "It is what stops the hunter from breaking his promise to share his meat and, knowing that, it is what gives the arrow-maker the confidence to stop hunting.", "It was the \"main pillar that upholds the whole edifice.", "If it is removed, the great, the immense fabric of human society... must in a moment crumble to atoms\".", "But Smith recognised our own frailty.", "The temptation to follow our immediate selfinterest could sometimes be overwhelming, and our own 'selfish passions' would take precedence over the judgment of the \"impartial spectator\".", "As commercial society evolves, and we exchange with those much more remote from us, our human frailties matter more.", "We need a mechanism to help us exhibit the \"sympathy\" that is both desirable and necessary.", "We need social institutions to bolster our often erratic ability to see things from the perspective of the impartial spectator.", "These social institutions are not just given to us.", "We choose to build them as a framework for collective decisions that constrain individual behaviour.", "We make them, and sometimes we break them.", "These two points from Smith's commentary - the importance of institutions and our desire to build them - are closely related to the role of trust in a modern economy.", "How could we drive, eat or even buy or sell unless we trusted other people?", "It is surely trust not money that makes the world go round.", "Indeed, we shall see that money works only when it is trusted.", "But human frailty implies that trust can be placed more easily when it is supported by institutions.", "Those institutions may well require trust, but equally trust requires institutions.", "Many economists -
