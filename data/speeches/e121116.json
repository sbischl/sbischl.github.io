the extent of data coverage, granularity and timeliness.", "Indeed, it has been often noted that the surprise element at the onset of economic and financial crisis is often due to the lack of high quality, comprehensive and timely data.", "For example, the Asian Financial Crisis revealed major gaps in statistical coverage, especially on detailed cross border exposures and indicators for financial soundness, which had permitted serious vulnerabilities to go undetected and unresolved for a long time.", "Another key lesson learnt, was from the global financial crisis, where the lack of data and monitoring of financial innovation that had allowed the build up of financial risks to go undetected until it was too late.", "Another good example was the existent of a large shadow banking system that is unregulated and unsupervised.", "At the same time, insufficient coverage and depth of information can potentially place policymakers at the risk of deriving at the wrong conclusion and thus, prescribing the wrong policy measures or prescriptions.", "The decisions that we make are only as good as the data on which it is based.", "In this respect, I would highlight two areas in particular that requires further data compilation.", "First, in the area of labour market statistics, there are notable gaps in terms of data collection on the economy-wide wages, hours worked per labour, productivity index, unit labour cost and duration of employment.", "We also do not have data and enough information on the kind of jobs that the economy is producing, either by sector, wage level, type of jobs and for whom the jobs are created.", "The data gaps would complicate the assessment on key issues such as the sustainability of household indebtedness, whether we are creating the right type of jobs or whether our policies are providing long term or temporary employment.", "Second, there are significant gaps in terms of balance sheet data, especially for households and corporates.", "This deficiency in data complicates detection of vulnerabilities, build up of risks and propagation of shocks from one sector to another.", "I hope the discussion today would provide insights into dealing with some of these issues I earlier mentioned.", "At this conference, we will have the opportunity to examine areas which we can improve so that our statistics are credible, relevant and timely, would facilitate informed policy formulation and decision making by the authorities, and enable informed decision makings by economic agents such as investors, financial institutions and the general public at large.", "In the first three sessions today, our distinguished speakers and discussants will share insights and experiences in many areas;
