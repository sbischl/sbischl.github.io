external debt indicators are favorable.", "Moreover, the country's external debt remained largely medium- to long-term in nature (80.5 percent of total external debt).", "This means that FX requirements for debt payments are well spread out and, thus, more manageable.", "We are committed to maintaining a flexible and market-determined exchange rate which allows us to conduct independent monetary policy focused on assessment of domestic conditions.", "This likewise promotes our resilience against external shocks.", "Recent depreciation of the peso is attributed to both fundamental and
