have done better, with exports growing respectively by 16%, 19% and 37% over the same period, with, of course, no internal exchange rate adjustment.", "Linking competitiveness with exchange rate

regarding sovereign risk.", "Our answer is twofold.", "First, get the fundamentals right.", "For European countries, it means reverting to a sustainable fiscal position which requires a significant primary surplus.", "And second, there is a need for a liquidity backstop to ensure that bad equilibria will not develop.", "Where that backstop is coming from is a key question.", "Unconventional monetary policies have led many central banks to purchase significant amounts of Government debt: those purchases amount to 51% of the total debt issued since 2009 in the UK, 21% in the US versus 7.5% in the euro area - where they were fully sterilized.", "These policy stances have contributed to giving markets an insurance against a potential dry-up in liquidity.", "At the present time, the insurance provided by many monetary authorities may look cheap because inflation is projected to stay low and markets seem to reward those countries which liquefy public debt.", "However this equilibrium could be unstable and market makers, aware of some inflation \"tail risks\", are hedging themselves through gold or currencies like the Swiss franc whose exchange rates have reached

be rewarded at the end?", "I strongly believe so and I will explain why.", "In the next decade, the world can be grouped in two categories: on the one hand, advanced economies, with high absorption capacity, low savings and high debt with ratios close to 100%.", "On the other, emerging economies, with high savings, low debt (around 30% GDP on average) and less absorption capacity.", "Our common prosperity will therefore depend on our ability to create stable channels of financial intermediation between those two parts of the world.", "That, in turn, will crucially depend on the existence of assets that can be considered safe stores of value.", "But, as I have argued from the start, public debt may not be able to play that role to the same extent as before.", "The ultimate safe asset,
