yen-carry borrowing strategies.", "than fixed-rate countries (ie they were not, in fact, able to direct monetary policy to the needs of the domestic economy, but had to use it to defend their exchange rates).", "But the main problem faced by emerging countries which chose a free float is how the rate would behave in the face of the large and volatile capital flows which these countries experienced in the 1990s.", "In due course, these flows seem likely to resume for many, if not all, of the countries which experienced them in the 1990s.", "They are driven by two powerful factors.", "First, the desire for diversification on the part of the managers of the huge stock of investment funds in America and Europe, whose weight of foreign assets is well below the theoretical desideratum.", "Secondly, by the intrinsically high profit prospects in the Asian emerging countries (more on this later).", "It is worthwhile spending some time to see just how difficult a problem this is.", "In standard versions of the exchange rate story, the real exchange rate is determined by productivity developments in the real economy, and capital flows tend to play a rather secondary role.", "They are often treated, essentially, as a residual.", "Implicitly, there is a ready supply of world capital, so that the current account is determined by a country's saving/investment balance, and the capital account is a residual to fund this.", "There is also a presumption that there is a ready supply of stabilising speculators, so any significant departures from fundamentals will be ironed out promptly.", "The standard model for incorporating capital flows into the analysis is the portfolio balance view, where the main action is with interest differentials.", "With some interest differential in place (usually reflecting differing cyclical positions), enough capital flows to the country to push up the exchange rate so that expected returns are equalised internationally (risk-adjusted, of course) by the prospect of a subsequent reversal of the exchange rate.", "The higher exchange rate helps to open up a current account deficit, which provides the real transfer counterpart of the financial flows.", "But if we try to apply this to the emerging countries, the fit is not good.", "Perhaps most fundamentally, the countries which received huge capital inflows in the first half of the 1990s offered high interest rates (real and nominal), not as a temporary cyclical policy response to the phase of the cycle, but on a continuing basis.", "While these countries are making the transition towards the technological frontier, it is quite likely that higher returns will be available to capital, so a real interest rate differential will persist over the medium term - decades rather than years.", "Capital inflow cannot immediately reduce this interest differential.", "In the meantime, portfolio equilibrium could, in theory, be maintained by the real exchange rate being bid up, so that the higher domestic interest rate is balanced by the prospect of subsequent depreciation., How should the exchange rate behave in these circumstances?", "Real interest differentials of, say, 3% might persist for a decade or more.", "If these numbers are realistic, the portfolio balance model would suggest that the exchange rate has to appreciate initially by some 30% (and will appear seriously and persistently uncompetitive for trade in goods and services), before depreciating by 3% per year over the following decade.", "So the potential swings in real exchange rates, even if well-behaved in terms of the model, are much greater for emerging markets.", "Add to this some extrapolative expectations, some herding, and above all a risk premium which varies with the latest wave of euphoria or pessimism, and the potential both for volatility, and for significant and sustained misalignment - in both directions - is clear.", "It seems unlikely, to say the least, that an exchange rate could follow this portfolio-balance path of appreciation followed by depreciation without the market balking at the large shifts and the overvaluation during the long transition.", "Is it not surprising, in such a world, that countries have sought to limit the extent of the swings (misalignments).", "They have sought to resist the appreciations of the exchange rate during the periods of large capital inflow partly because of an intuition (which gains some support from the Japanese experiences in the 1950s and 1960s) that strong international competitiveness provided beneficial price signals for the most dynamic sector of the economy - tradeables, especially exports.", "Elements of old-fashioned mercantalism may be present also.", "Perhaps more important still, the large foreign capital inflow creates a destabilising feedback loop while the inflow is strong, the rising exchange rate reduces the cost of borrowing in foreign currency, and encourages more borrowing.", "At the first sign of some weakness in inflow or the exchange rate, domestic borrowers (including, sometimes, banks) are exposed to greater credit risk, and their lenders (understandably) will want to withdraw funding.", "This has many of the characteristics of a domestic bank run.", "If confidence could be maintained (in this case, in the stability of the exchange rate), then the withdrawal of funds will not occur.", "If confidence weakens, the process is self-reinforcing.", "This self-reinforcing instability cannot be easily removed.", "Some have suggested hedging as the answer.", "There is, first, the question of whether the country as a whole can hedge its foreign exchange risk.", "While an individual can shift the risk to another party, a country in aggregate can only hedge its risk if it can persuade foreigners to take on the foreign exchange risk - in effect, lend in the domestic currency.", "Even if this could be achieved, one party in foreign capital flow transactions (either the borrower or the lender) will be exposed to foreign-currency risk, and will have the incentive to unwind the transaction in the face of a threat to the exchange rate.", "In this rather unstable world, it is hardly surprising that countries have resisted the upward pressure on exchange rates that accompanies big capital inflows, because they feel (with some justification) that it makes them vulnerable to later sharp depreciation.", "When, after the crisis, many commentators attribute the crisis to overvalued exchange rates, and others urge these countries to hold reserves equal to their short-term debt (the so-called Guidotti Rule), is it surprising that authorities intuitively feel justified in resisting appreciations?", "But if the correct lessons are to be taken from the crisis, then those countries which do not have strong reasons to go to a hard fix should move decisively away from \"fixed-but-adjustable\", to adopt a version of what has become widely-used best practice: allowing the market to determine the rate, leaving considerable volatility (ie not leaning against the wind through frequent intervention), and even when the rate moves significantly away from what are judged to be the \"fundamentals\", being prepared to put up with this, and stay the resort to intervention, until the case is overwhelming and the prospect of success good.", "Interest rate changes in support of the exchange rate are a legitimate part of this regime, while acknowledging that feasible interest rate settings may not be enough to counter extreme market pessimism.", "This is clearly distinct from the totally passive position of a free float (\"benign neglect\"), but it is what is generally done in most developed countries.", "And, most importantly, it is a long way from the day-by-day activism that has been discredited by the crisis.", "Unless we take into account why countries have a \"fear of floating\", and have often gravitated to soft fixes in the face of capital inflows, we will be in no position to provide persuasive arguments for the adoption of greater flexibility.", "Perhaps the basis of persuasion might be three-fold: \u2022 that some flexibility will be helpful in absorbing the capital inflow, in buffering external shocks, and responding to the changing productive capacity of their economies; \u2022 that this flexibility (aka short-term volatility) may inhibit some short-term flows, by serving as a constant reminder that exchange rate volatility can outweigh the interest-rate advantage of foreign-currency borrowings;11 \u2022 allowing (even encouraging) a fair degree of volatility around a real exchange rate which is stable over time (or moves only slowly, in response to changing fundamentals) provides the opportunity for the authorities to have the best of flexibility, while leaving open the possibility of intervention (both via interest rates and directly in foreign exchange markets) when the rate has already moved quite some distance away from the fundamentals.", "There are obviously difficult practical issues regarding the operation of intervention, but the intuitive idea is straight-forward enough - the further the actual exchange rate has departed from the equilibrium, the more damage the misalignment will do; the more confident the authorities can be that they will be acting as profitable stabilising speculators (buying cheap and selling dear); and the greater likelihood of success of any intervention on the part of the authorities (see Volcker (1995)).", "In short, there is scope for emerging economies to operate flexible exchange rate regimes without them having to adopt a textbook type of pure float.", "Indeed, it would be odd if the international debate urged emerging markets to adopt more pure forms of floating than the industrial countries have been able to sustain, especially when the conditions necessary for a successful pure float are less likely to be present in such economies.", "Even this strategy will be uncomfortable, and is not guaranteed to succeed.", "Large reserves and uncomfortable interest rates might be needed to mount an effective defence, and it will be tempting to mount this defence too early (not to allow enough flex).", "If a concrete example is needed to illustrate the point, Singapore provides it.", "It was, arguably, the most successful country exposed to the full force of the crisis, with a managed exchange rate (managed both in the sense of intervention and through well-designed active capital account policies) (see Lee Hsien Loong (2000)).", "Back-up or support for the exchange rate regime What more could be done by emerging markets to enhance the possibility of a successful exchange rate regime?", "If we accept that one of the central factors presenting pressures on exchange rate regimes in emerging markets is large and volatile capital flows, then the obvious issue is whether measures can be taken to reduce the size and volatility of the flows.", "The first possibility here is capital controls.", "Mere mention of this possibility creates deep rifts in the debate, with views strongly held and a fair bit of heat generated in the process.", "The process of transition (financial deregulation) is tricky and time-consuming.", "Perhaps the common-sense way to approach this is to accept the possibility that Chilean-style controls (taxes on short-term inflows) may be useful for some countries during the transition, but not too much should be expected of them (see the conclusions on Chile itself, which suggest that the controls managed to lengthen the maturity of the debt, without being able to prevent the exchange rate from appreciating during the phase of capital inflow) (see Edwards (1998)).", "It may also be useful to adopt the techniques used successfully by Singapore (and now others) to limit the ability of domestic banks to lend to foreigners in domestic currency, thus making it much harder for foreign speculators to take large short positions on the currency.", "Other than these specific types of capital control, there are a set of issues which can be put in terms of prudential supervision, rather than capital controls.", "The sorts of prudential controls which might be used are to limit the opportunities for residents to borrow in foreign currency (ie to prevent a repeat of the Bangkok International Banking Facility) and to monitor them when they do; and to keep very tight (indeed, unashamedly intrusive) constraints on banks' ability to have open foreign exchange positions or indirect exposure through foreign exchange loans.", "The brief lesson here is that emerging countries should be very ready to put on tough prudential controls, and should ignore those who claim (as happened in Australia during the 1980s) that such prudential controls are \"re-regulation by the back door\".", "The doctrinal protagonists of free markets (usually arguing their own self-interest above all) must not be allowed to intimidate regulatory authorities into ignoring the case for \"rules of the game\".", "On a wider canvas, the emerging countries should press forward with the efforts to put in place best-practice accounting, legal and corporate systems and regulations.", "The quality of credit and investment standards, and the strength of management of corporate risks and balance sheets will determine how closely capital flows match fundamental investment opportunities.", "This will determine how effectively a country captures the benefits of access to world capital markets.", "Paradoxically, marked improvement in these areas may well encourage even greater inflows: but it should, at least, lessen the likelihood of sudden reversals of capital.", "A tentative operational classification Countries might be categorised this way: (a) Those whose size or market development justify floating (ie those who will want to have an independent monetary policy, and have the institutions to make this feasible).", "While credible monetary and fiscal policy will contribute to exchange rate stability, even these countries will, at times, find that exchange rates move too far relative to fundamentals.", "There may be a legitimate role for intervention in these circumstances, but it should be used sparingly to have the desired impact upon expectations and the behaviour of market participants.", "In a flexible rate regime, what is the appropriate nominal anchor to pin down market expectations (eg an inflation target)?", "(b) Those in transition to this state.", "While accepting the advantages of flexibility, these countries may want a greater degree of fixity for a time, to help anchor expectations where these are fragile.", "These countries may reinforce their exchange rate stability by policies that reduce the attractiveness and the potentially harmful effects of short-term, easily-reversible capital flows.", "Countries in these categories might need to focus on systems that encourage long-term financing and on maintaining stable current account deficits.", "These countries may want to contemplate Chilean-style capital controls (price-based aimed at short-term flows) and to moderate the pace of financial liberalisation, to keep in step with the pace of development of financial infrastructure.", "Adoption of sound and consistent economic policies may gradually build credibility, but the economy may remain vulnerable during this building process.", "Financial infrastructure will develop and gain depth over time.", "As this happens and markets gain knowledge of and confidence in the regime, exchange rates should become less vulnerable and less in need of defensive capital controls.", "In the meantime, countries should be ready to move quickly away from defence of an unsustainable rate (which obviously requires fine judgment about \"sustainability\").", "Allowing exchange rate movement (even if excessive) will, generally, be preferable to exhausting foreign exchange reserves defending a particular level of the exchange rate.", "(c) Those countries where the case for a fixed rate is compelling might want to consider the rival merits of some form of strong policy commitment - a currency board or dollarisation.", "This would include small countries with a similar economic structure to the potential anchor country; countries (including larger countries) with a high degree of economic integration, measured by trade or investment flows; or those with a history of poor economic management and currency crises, where governments cannot borrow long-term domestically, or in domestic currency offshore.", "For many small, and typically open, countries, the cost of an independent monetary policy will often be greater than the stabilising benefit of a flexible exchange rate.", "But there are costs, too, in these strongly fixed systems - if lender of last resort is to be provided, it would be a fiscal rather than central bank matter; and dollarisation may imply loss of seigniorage.", "If a hard fix is elected, what is the most appropriate anchor currency?", "The Harry Johnson and Milton Friedman quotes cited above now seem touchingly nai\u0308ve, or at best outdated advocacy, overtaken by the experience of three decades of floating rates.", "Flexible rates have turned out to flex more than expected.", "Developed countries have learned to live successfully with this, but it is harder going for emerging countries with big capital flows.", "The best-practice regime commonly used in developed countries allows wide latitude for the market to set the rate, supported by occasional intervention and rather more frequent help from interest rates.", "Many emerging countries could benefit from moving to this generic type of regime, and to help this process, we need a vigorous debate about when to intervene (and, more importantly, when not to); what role interest rates and inflation targets might play; and what additional measures might help to handle large and volatile capital flows.", "This will take the debate far away from the fixed-but-adjustable regimes that failed during the crisis, towards the floating end of the spectrum.", "But no good case is improved by exaggeration: \"benign neglect\" is not best practice anywhere, and a rhetoric which fuzzes this issue is unhelpful.", "To truncate the debate by excluding, from the outset, the valid modifications to this \"end spectrum\" solution runs the risk that countries will not only fuzz the debating points, but fuzz their own understanding of the issues, and leave them unprepared for the coming challenges.", "The last word could be given to a veteran of this debate, Richard Cooper (1999, pp 16-17): \"What is less obvious is that floating rates, independent monetary policy, and freedom of capital movements may also be incompatible, at least for countries with small and poorly developed domestic capital markets, ie for most countries.", "That would leave a more limited menu of choice for such countries: between floating rates with capital account restrictions and some monetary autonomy, or fixed rates free of capital restrictions but with loss of monetary autonomy.", "Put bluntly, two prescriptions regularly extended to developing countries by the international community,
