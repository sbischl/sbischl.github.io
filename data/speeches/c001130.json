that the euro is accepted by the international financial markets as a stable reserve currency, the medium and long term will see the euro's share in Turkey's financial accounts continue to increase.", "I personally think that acceptance of the euro in daily life and financial transactions will come faster in Turkey than in other countries, for three reasons: the large numbers of Turkish citizens living in Europe, the large volume of trade and tourism transactions with Europe, and the consistent stability of the deutsche mark for 20 years and more.", "The introduction of the euro has reduced

introduction of the euro, these figures have barely changed: the respective shares are 40% and 33%.", "The second positive effect is that the Convergence Criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, and the Copenhagen Criteria, require economies seeking to join the EU and EMU to become efficient market economies and achieve a high degree of verifiable convergence with the EU.", "As we all know, the
