a possible source of systemic risk.", "If the people managing capital cushions and liquidity buffers view these tools as sufficient mitigants for the costs of misconduct, or if powerful incentives encourage workarounds of the new regulations, then the connection between post-crisis reforms and greater financial stability becomes threatened.", "In the last year, we have seen emerging approaches to supervision that aim to address culture, conduct and governance.", "These methods are being developed in a number of jurisdictions.", "I am pleased to welcome representatives of 15 foreign supervisors and other official sector agencies who are joining the many representatives of U.S. supervisory and regulatory agencies here today.", "The topic of culture and conduct has truly become a global dialogue.", "We have a lot to learn from each other.", "One question on the minds of many in the official sector is, \"what is the most effective way to promote reform?\"", "Sharing ideas on leading practices, challenges and the opportunities for industry collaboration is a start -
