with overabundant liquidity leading to the misallocation of capital - to another - where, in some systemically important markets, capital is barely being allocated at all.", "The challenge for policy-makers is to provide transition support that effectively restarts rather than replaces markets.", "As I have argued elsewhere, this may require structural changes to some markets, including the greater use of clearing houses, and a re-thinking of the scale and frequency of central bank liquidity operations.", "Procyclical capital adequacy The second risk identified in the FSR is the procyclicality of bank capital.", "Put simply, banks characteristically increase leverage in a boom, further feeding the expansion, before reducing leverage in a downturn, exacerbating the slowdown.", "Regulation often reinforces these tendencies when it should lean against them.", "This is now a serious global problem.", "Banks outside of Canada are under enormous pressure to reduce leverage.", "Given the scope of likely ultimate losses from structured products alone, it would take an enormous amount of capital to reduce average leverage ratios to Canadian levels.", "Bank of Canada research estimates that U.S., U.K. and European banks would need to raise a combined US$1.2 trillion to bring their leverage ratios down to Canadian levels.", "These capital needs will rise linearly with any recession-induced writedowns.", "In this environment, banks are inclined to hoard capital, rather than deploy it.", "In a world with guarantees, liquidity and funding support, regulators should not reinforce this tendency.", "In Canada, our banks are not facing the same pressures to de-lever as their counterparts abroad.", "Still, their loan portfolios would experience higher credit losses in a deep or prolonged downturn.", "The risk identified in the FSR is that market forces could compel banks to maintain higher capital ratios than necessary to guard against the possibility of worse economic outcome.", "This could lead banks to slow balance sheet growth, which would tighten lending conditions for both households and businesses and weaken the economy.", "Ultimately, the financial institutions themselves would suffer from this self-fulfilling prophecy.", "Given these concerns, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions last month took the welcome step of giving Canadian banks more flexibility by allowing them to raise the proportion of preferred shares that comprise their Tier 1 capital from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.", "The lower absolute leverage of Canadian institutions and the higher quality of their Tier 1 capital should mean that they can expand lending faster than their international peers.", "The value of this virtually unique advantage of our economy should not be underestimated.", "The Bank is working with its international counterparts to examine how the current regulatory capital framework may amplify fluctuations in economic and financial conditions.", "Under current rules, capital requirements are linked to the credit risk in an institution's portfolio.", "In an upturn, risk goes down, banks are required to hold less capital, and the growth of credit increases.", "The problem is that this can amplify swings in financial conditions and lead to the emergence of financial imbalances.", "Recall the link between credit growth and future financial stress that I just mentioned.", "Then, during the downturn when credit risk increases, banks are required to increase capital holdings, thus exacerbating the economic weakness and financial stress.", "This is the motivation for proposals to have capital requirements move procyclically.", "Banks could be required to build up capital buffers during times of rapid credit expansion.", "This would strengthen their balance sheets and reduce the risk that financial imbalances will develop from overly easy financial conditions.", "During a downturn, banks could then draw down these buffers, which would reduce the need to liquidate assets or restrict loan growth at a time when credit conditions and asset prices are already under stress.", "In this way, capital requirements would moderate the ups and downs of the credit cycle - the reverse of what currently happens - reducing the risk of a future crisis.", "This macroprudential approach to capital requirements is tremendously important, but it is also complex, with a number of practical and logistical concerns.", "Such a system could be accomplished by linking capital requirements to movements in credit-cycle indicators, such as loan growth and asset prices.", "For example, our research on the determinants of financial stress that I mentioned a moment ago can help inform the development of such regulatory guidelines.", "It is probably unrealistic to think that ex ante a perfect formula can be derived.", "Ultimately, there are important questions regarding the balance of rules and discretion and, regarding the latter, who should exercise that discretion.", "Household balance sheets The third risk relates to the health of Canadian household balance sheets.", "Household credit makes up about 60 per cent of the Canadian banking sector's total loan exposure, so losses on household lending would likely have an immediate impact on capital adequacy and forward profitability.", "The household sector could be an important channel through which global economic weakness affects the Canadian financial sector more widely.", "While the Canadian household sector remains relatively healthy, its resilience will be tested during the recession.", "Various indicators of financial stress, such as bankruptcies and loans in arrears, have increased recently from historically low levels.", "Falling equity markets and softening house prices have put pressure on household balance sheets at a time when the ratio of debt to income is already at a record high of 140 per cent.", "The household debt-toasset ratio has risen as the credit crisis intensified, reaching 19 per cent at the end of the third quarter - the highest level since 1990.", "At the same time, the debt-service ratio of households actually declined modestly to 7.5 per cent, well below the historical average of 9.2 per cent seen since 1992, owing to lower effective borrowing costs.", "This gives a measure of assurance that most households can comfortably manage their debts.", "The health of Canadian households is obviously important to our banking sector.", "If the global economic downturn were significantly more severe than projected, then household defaults in Canada could rise sharply.", "This risk would be magnified if banks begin to tighten credit conditions to households more significantly than they have so far.", "In the FSR, we examined these risks using a simulated stress test.", "Specifically, we examined an extreme scenario where nominal household income drops at an average annual rate of 2 per cent for six straight quarters as a result of global economic weakness.", "Such an event could double - from 3 per cent to 6 per cent - the proportion of Canadian households considered to be vulnerable; that is, with debt-service ratios above 40 per cent of income.", "Further, those vulnerable households would own 13 per cent of total household debt, a figure double the average of the past 10 years.", "If this scenario were to materialize, it would prompt significant losses among Canada's banks.", "However, it is important not to overplay this scenario, since it actually illustrates the strength of our system.", "First, the scenario is extreme - the annual growth of household income has not been negative during any quarter over the 37 years for which data are available.", "Second, while the average Tier 1 capital ratio of our banks would fall from 9.7 per cent to about 8.8 per cent, this figure is still more than two times the minimum ratio allowed under the Basel II Accord, and well above OSFI's 7 per cent threshold.", "There are a number of reasons why the risk posed by household balance sheets is significantly lower in Canada than elsewhere, not the least of which is Canada's more conservative lending culture.", "For example, subprime mortgages account for less than 5 per cent of Canadian mortgage lending, roughly one-third the level in the United States.", "Further, since Canada requires insurance on high-loan-to-value mortgages and Canada Mortgage Bonds carry an explicit sovereign guarantee, there has been no negative feedback loop between the housing market and the financial sector as has been all too apparent in other major economies.", "While Canada's debt-service ratio remains below its historical average, as I mentioned, the debt-service ratio in the United States remains above its historical average.", "Further, the absolute cost of household debt in Canada - both mortgage and other loans - has fallen by about 100 basis points since the onset of the crisis last year.", "Nonetheless, the Bank of Canada will continue to closely monitor the risk posed to financial stability from household balance sheets.", "In addition, the Bank will closely consider the possibility that households may be more sensitive to shocks to their income or wealth as it develops its outlook for Canadian growth and inflation.", "In times of crisis, it is easy to understand the links between financial stability and the real economy.", "While these are all too apparent, it is sometimes hard to see the end of the crisis.", "The actions that policy-makers are taking will be effective.", "The global economy will emerge from this period of weakness.", "In the years ahead, when times are better, the need to promote financial stability may not be as clear-cut, even though it will be no less important.", "The Bank of Canada will continue to take a macroprudential approach.", "We will use all the tools at our disposal to promote financial stability at home and abroad and, in so doing, continue to contribute to the economic and financial welfare of Canada."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Financial Stability", "Macroprudential Approach", "Liquidity", "Capital Adequacy", "Household Balance Sheets", "Financial Stress", "Risk Assessment", "Early-Warning System", "Procyclical Capital", "Monetary Policy"]}
