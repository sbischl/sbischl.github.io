underlying economic strength has remained, supported by generally strong household and business balance sheets, government spending and investment, and strong export returns for our key goods.", "The

economic impact of COVID-19.", "In New Zealand, the low global interest rate environment coincided with very low rates of house building relative to population growth in the past decade, leading to a significant supply-demand mismatch and accentuated house price growth.", "The collaborative work we are undertaking with other government agencies highlights that the lack of access to space to build

taken action to manage the financial stability concerns associated with the rapid rise in house prices.", "We recently further tightened Loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions, which are our main tool
