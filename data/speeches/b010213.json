mention five of these structural changes.", "It is of course important to recognise, as I do so, that while the euro has been the catalyst for these changes it is not the only cause.", "But in each case, the City of London has been playing a leading role as a centre of innovation and excellence.", "The first change is the growth of euro issuance - particularly in the private sector, as the financing needs of euro-area governments are limited by fiscal discipline and special influences, such as the proceeds of mobile phone auctions.", "The flow of corporate euro bond and equity issuance has grown significantly, though it is important to keep this in proportion: the stock of issuance outstanding in both cases is still - by some margin - lower than the US.", "(Domestic debt securities

and settlement of securities are still fragmented nationally by sector.", "Market firms are keen to see consolidation of the arrangements for clearing and settling securities trades, where costs are still considerably greater in Europe than in the US.", "Even without mergers, market firms can of course trade remotely from a single location, though this does not address the issue of duplicate investment costs.", "But it seems that full rationalisation may take years to implement and, while the broad vision of integrated European systems is widely shared, there are still differences of view about how best to achieve it.", "The third change is the diversification of investment.", "The launch of the euro has begun to encourage a shift in funds away from the particular national market in which they have traditionally been invested, and towards investment across the euro area as a whole.", "This helps to explain the increasing use by fund managers of European benchmark indices against

Fleming, affect investment banking activity in Europe as much as in the US.", "Consolidation is much less far advanced in retail banking in Europe, where national differences in the retail markets are still pronounced.", "Much has already been done to remove obstacles to the integration of Europe's capital markets.", "But the launch of the euro has served to highlight the barriers that remain.",
