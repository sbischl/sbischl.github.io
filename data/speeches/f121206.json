required to ensure the sustainability of public finances.", "So keeping to the path of reform should be a main priority in the near term.", "Bank lending rates and the banks' willingness to grant loans have been relatively high on the public agenda since the financial crisis.", "Since 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank has reduced its interest rates on a number of occasions.", "But individual bank customers have, perhaps, experienced a different reality.", "The banks have not reduced their lending rates by nearly as much as Danmarks Nationalbank has, and within the last six months many have announced higher interest rates, while the monetary-policy rates have continued to fall.", "There are several reasons for this.", "The unusually low level of interest rates has made it difficult - not to say impossible - for banks to reduce deposit rates further.", "To avoid undermining their earnings, the banks are compelled to keep their lending rates unchanged.", "At the same time, the banks have been met with tougher earnings requirements.", "While higher earnings must compensate for higher credit risk under less favourable business conditions, new and more stringent capital-adequacy

view to increasing funding options for small and medium-sized enterprises, the opportunities to expand the use of corporate bonds are currently being explored.", "Danmarks Nationalbank welcomes this initiative, provided that it takes place on market terms.", "It has attracted considerable international attention, most recently from the European Commission, that Danish households have far more gross debt relative to income than households in other countries.", "The low rate of interest on variable-rate mortgage loans has often been identified as the reason why the finances of the households are, nevertheless, generally sound.", "This raises the question of how robust household finances are to rising interest rates, and whether an increase could jeopardise financial stability.", "Today we are able to provide a fairly detailed answer to these questions.", "The main conclusion of an extensive study of household finances is that the threat to financial stability from household debt and its composition is limited.", "The assessment is based on the share of the debt held by families with particularly tight budgets.", "Most families have robust finances and are resilient to negative events such as a strong increase in interest rates or a protracted period of unemployment if they reduce consumption or savings, although this may entail considerable lifestyle changes.", "And this assessment does not even take into account that a continuous rise in interest rates is very likely to go hand in hand with an economic recovery and hence better employment opportunities.", "Obviously this assessment of the risk to financial stability does not rule out the possibility that higher interest rates could have rather unpleasant implications for families with very tight finances.", "Before I step down, it might be appropriate to reflect on some of the experience I have gained during my seven years as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank.", "Naturally, it will only be a brief summary.", "Without doubt, the financial crisis is the single event that has had the strongest impact on the financial sector during my tenure.", "How did we tackle the crisis itself?", "Which follow-up steps should we take?", "Regardless of our actions, Denmark is a small, open economy and we would have been hit by the international financial crisis which from the autumn of 2008 caused international trade to contract by 20 per cent and later led to a European debt crisis that has descended like a fog of uncertainty on the European economies.", "The key question is whether we in Denmark had made ourselves vulnerable to the severe shock that hit us from abroad.", "The answer is an unqualified \"yes\".", "Even without a financial crisis, the Danish economy would have been under pressure.", "In this country, the preceding international boom with ample liquidity and low interest rates was allowed to develop into an unusual overheating of the economy, which was already slowing down when the shock hit us.", "The tax freeze, tax cuts, growth in public spending and new mortgage types were the domestic factors behind the overheating.", "The banks' lending growth, skyrocketing property prices and unsustainably low unemployment were manifestations of the overheating.", "Cause and effect worked both ways.", "It has been discussed whether Danmarks Nationalbank issued sufficient warnings against this overheating.", "The truth is that the Danish government in the autumn of 2006 ignored a clear encouragement to tighten fiscal policy by kr.", "8 billion; in fact, it even eased fiscal policy in 2007.", "And the opposition wanted to spend even more.", "Admittedly, such tightening measures should preferably have been introduced at an earlier stage, but even in the autumn of 2006 Danmarks Nationalbank could not find support for its view.", "This goes to show how difficult it is to conduct countercyclical economic policy.", "Often there is lack of ability and willingness to acknowledge problems in time and take action.", "So stabilisation policy should first and foremost be achieved by introducing automatic stabilisers in the economy, observing sustainable medium-term spending targets and aiming for structurally balanced government budgets.", "Labour market structures should be designed to promote growth and employment.", "When the crisis really hit the financial sector in September 2008, a large majority in the Danish parliament - the Folketing - implemented the first of a series of bank rescue packages which have softened the worst blows against the financial sector.", "It has been a great strength that these initiatives have received broad political support.", "The bank rescue packages were introduced as crisis measures.", "An actual revision of the rules on banking activities, based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis, is now underway and is to a large extent taking place at the international level.", "For Denmark, this will initially result in EU regulation, subsequently in Danish rules to fill in the EU framework.", "A large financial legislation package is currently being submitted to the Folketing.", "I have the draft with me here.", "(Although I should add that the weight can be halved by printing on both sides of the paper.)", "And we will see much more in the coming years.", "It is understandable that the rules are being tightened after the excesses of the financial crisis, and Denmark has very little scope for independent action.", "All the same, it is worth considering whether the growing volume of legislation and the increasing complexity of the rules will provide better assurance against future crises.", "Professor and Doctor of Law Linda Nielsen, who works with banking law and investment, recently made a noteworthy contribution to the debate in the daily Politiken.", "Everyone working with these issues should read it.", "Her main point is that the number of rules aimed at regulating the financial sector's activities is overwhelming - and more are to come - and often the contents are so detailed and complex to read that even a person with a doctorate in law finds them very difficult to understand.", "There is a multitude of different rules with different structures, exemptions and levels of detail.", "What does this mean to banks, their boards and their customers, and how about the legislators?", "Are we constructing a vehicle where the person in the driver's seat with a firm grip on the steering wheel believes to be steering it, while the car is in fact following its own path with considerable backlash?", "There is no simple answer to this question, which is not unique to financial regulation.", "As I have already said, individual countries have little room for manoeuvre as these activities take place at the international level.", "However, it is important to make the rules as clear and simple as possible.", "That will make them easier to observe and control.", "Let me try to illustrate this.", "Since 2004, Danmarks Nationalbank has prepared so-called outlier memos, i.e.", "On the basis of - mainly - published financial statements for a large group of banks, we have been able to point out those that achieved the lowest scores for selected key ratios, such as excess capital adequacy, high lending growth, large exposures and earnings capacity.", "Using this simple method, we sought to identify potentially vulnerable banks.", "Subsequently, we have concluded that virtually all of the banks within this group that have actually become distressed had been identified beforehand using this relatively simple method.", "The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority was aware of this and included it in its supervisory activities.", "With the \"Supervisory Diamond\", the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has taken a step in the right direction, with focus on observing a few key ratios - and now with sanctions for non-observance.", "And others can also monitor these key ratios.", "Another interesting observation is that among the 10 banks identified before the crisis as having the highest exposures to the property sector, 8-9 have subsequently become distressed.", "So the conclusion is that relatively simple key ratios can be used to identify the banks that could be at risk.", "Aggressive lending growth combined with property speculation is the single factor with the greatest impact on the banks that have folded.", "Seen in a broader perspective, Denmark has navigated the financial crisis fairly well so far.", "The weeding out of unsound banks has almost been completed, and after all less than 6 per cent of the banks became distressed - measured by balance-sheet total.", "Despite the large house price falls, the number of enforced sales is limited - especially when compared with the housing crisis in the early 1990s.", "If we disregard periods of unsustainable overheating and subsequent adjustment, unemployment has not been lower for the last 40 years.", "Denmark has sound economic ratios and internationally it is among the countries with the highest credit ratings.", "The reason why we have not been more severely hit is that we had the necessary buffers.", "All in all, this is no bad point of departure for meeting the challenges of the coming years.", "In my seven years as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank, 1/3 of Denmark's banks have disappeared - in numeric terms.", "The decline has been steady over this period and is in keeping with a trend that goes far back - crisis or no crisis.", "Danmarks Nationalbank will gladly assist you in calculating when you will be able to hold your annual meeting at a decent-sized dining table - if this trend continues.", "As I see it, the most significant factor is the increasing complexity of banking.", "So if I may offer a piece of sound advice to a Director of the Danish Bankers Association (chief lobbyist) who wishes to continue to have a large number of paying members, I suggest that you give priority to clear and simple rules - especially for small banks.", "Regardless of the path you take, I would like to thank the Danish Bankers Association, its members, its employees and its Director for our good and constructive cooperation through seven years.", "Thank you for your attention."],
