are invested in annuities.", "One explanation for this is that annuity providers find it difficult to distinguish the healthy from the sick ex ante, the former purchasing more annuities than the latter, leading insurance companies to offer annuities on less attractive terms thus discouraging their purchase.", "This \"adverse selection\" is important - it is approximately 20% more expensive to buy annuities as an individual than in a group scheme.", "Collective risks raise additional problems.", "Longevity risk to a particular cohort can be shared only across generations.", "Those

increases.", "Financial markets are currently developing 'longevity bonds' along these lines.", "The interest rate on longevity bonds is linked to some measure of unexpected changes in average life expectancy.", "In the case of the recently announced European Investment Bank-BNP Paribas bond, the payout each year for the next 25 years will be a fixed sum multiplied by the proportion of people in

from pension funds and other providers of annuities.", "The supply might come from lifeinsurance companies, who benefit from increased longevity to the extent that fewer early deaths mean lower claims, and financial intermediaries collecting the savings of those younger investors prepared to bear some of the longevity risk of the old.", "How close private markets can get to providing the optimal amount of risk sharing is hard to say.", "Private annuity markets which could pool individual longevity risk are small.", "For collective longevity risks, the burden of unexpectedly high longevity for a particular cohort should be spread over as many generations as possible.", "In theory, this provides a potential role for government to share risks across generations.", "Fanny

to be said for the view that longevity risk is more efficiently shared collectively, leaving the private sector to provide insurance against individual mortality.", "The question of who should issue and who would buy longevity bonds merits further study.", "I have so far discussed only longevity risk.", "Clearly, any discussion of pension reform must include also the other key collective risks: to productivity, rates of return and fertility among others.", "We do not, of course, start with a clean slate.", "Existing government institutions - whether by design or default - already have important risksharing properties.", "Means-tested pensions and other benefits, as well as the National Health Service, already give the government a major role in the sharing of risks.", "But in reforming our pension system, it is important to separate two issues.", "First, how should we pay for the cost of present pension commitments?", "Second, what is the right structure for our pension system: which risks should be borne individually and which collectively?", "A debate is needed over whether present arrangements imply too much or too little sharing of risk.", "We should remember also that insurance is based on ignorance - ignorance of the outcomes facing each individual.", "But knowledge can turn risk into certainty.", "The advent of genetic testing could undermine a private market in insurance against longevity and illhealth.", "Even if insurance companies could not require testing as a condition of insurance, the fact that tests were available could increase even further the degree of adverse selection in such insurance markets.", "Pooling risks caused by unequal genetic inheritance might no longer be feasible.", "Insurance would become instead a question about redistribution, and hence a matter for public policy.", "Conclusions In this lecture I have stressed that most public policy decisions are a matter of the balance of risks.", "Indeed, it is the illusion of certainty that undermines much public debate.", "As Bertrand Russell said, \"The whole problem of the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts\".", "Recognising and modelling risks means understanding the limits to our present knowledge.", "Communicating risk is about transparency.", "When information on risks is provided to the public, it is often in a form that is hard to assess.", "Thinking carefully about communication is important to the level of public debate.", "The quantity of information is less relevant than its quality - sometimes less is more.", "And managing risk means making choices - collective choices - on the basis of a rational shared assessment of the risks involved.", "So let us face up to
