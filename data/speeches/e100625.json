financially underserved poor from the unending cycle of poverty, an inclusive financial system contributes towards greater social, economic, and political stability, a vital ingredient for growth.", "At the same time, we must also be wary of the increase in situations where access to finance leads to overindebtedness.", "Over-indebtedness can be the cause of much emotional hardship and stress,

always conducted within the framework of sound banking practices, risk management and adequate consumer protection.", "Importance of financial inclusion data in the growth and development of an inclusive Policy formulation for financial inclusion is complex for a number of reasons.", "First, it requires the active involvement of many different stakeholders, in particular Government agencies and very often a variety of NGOs, as well as financial institutions with specialized skills and knowledge.", "Second, the state of economic and social development of a society is an important determinant on the level and quality of financial inclusion.", "Third, what constitutes acceptable level of inclusion, in terms of access to finance, protection of personal rights and liberties, or

performing its macro- and micro-surveillance duties and in its policy-making role.", "The data in this case came from the development of a comprehensive credit registry system.", "The availability of such data also allows individuals with good payment track records to make a more credible case for access to credit, and helps overcome the limitation of inadequate collateral.", "Another example is

data.", "The fact that this area still remains relatively unexplored, compared to the availability of data for corporate business, financial markets and other more sophisticated aspects of finance, clearly suggests that much work remains to be done.", "The magnitude and scope of the topic also requires a diverse group of policymakers to collaborate on a long-term basis.", "The establishment of a working group to improve the quality of financial inclusion data is therefore most timely, and will benefit policymakers in making better and more informed policies, as well as tracking the outcome of policy initiatives.", "In addition, it may also serve to increase the visibility new issues areas which are currently not being given sufficient priority by policymakers.", "I would also like to encourage the working group to consider, in the longer term, the development of some form of a composite financial inclusion index.", "The composite index will benefit everyone by providing a broad
