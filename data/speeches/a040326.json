in the pursuit of its ambitious agenda of further development.", "Eastern enlargement, which future history books will quote as a landmark achievement on the path toward European integration, will become a reality in little more than a month's time, work on the draft Constitutional Treaty is very far advanced, and the EU is by no means short of important projects for the near future.",

stabilized at slightly below 2%.", "This signals the high credibility which the Eurosystem enjoys with professional analysts, financial markets and the general public.", "That success has only become possible against the background of the lasting consensus among European politicians that price stability is an important goal - both in its own right and as a precondition for sustainable growth.", "I mentioned before that we must never become complacent.", "We take this appeal very seriously in the Eurosystem.", "The quarterly Bank Lending Survey, the new euro area-wide interest rate statistics or various measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys are just a few examples of continuous efforts the ECB and NCB staffs make to improve on the quality and diversity of the information

in fiscal deficits need not entail below-average macroeconomic growth.", "As recent research by the European Commission shows, fiscal consolidation through cuts in expenditures is less likely to entail short-run growth-dampening effects than consolidation which relies on raising taxes.", "While recent tax cuts by a number of European governments, including that of Austria, are in principle

the introduction of the European currency, January 1, 1999, the further steps necessary to reach this goal and the name \"euro\" were decided.", "This important guidance from European leadership established a \"pioneering mood.\"", "It triggered the necessary work at the various technical levels dealing with the preparation of EMU.", "And, most importantly, it created confidence in European

fourth message is: Talk to people and get them actively involved!", "I think a major obstacle to implementation of the Lisbon Agenda by the various governments is a lack of communication with the public.", "It is thus not surprising that it seems to be rather difficult for people to accept the reforms.", "Thus, each Member State government needs to convince its citizens of the enormous potential and opportunities released by structural reforms.", "After all, what we aim for is higher per capita income, replacing redundant activities with more welfare-generating ones, investment in skills and education, a knowledge-based society, more innovation and sufficient research and development.", "I would think that these objectives are of such a genuinely positive nature that it should be possible to convince people of the reform steps necessary to reach them.", "At the same time, one should not - and cannot - conceal that some of the reforms necessary on the way are painful or unpleasant, and affect various groups of societies in different ways.", "In such cases of strong conflicts of interest it is all the more important to enter into an active, constructive dialogue and to jointly find acceptable, fair solutions, since, in the long run, no government can afford to ignore public opinion.", "I think that some of the official documents prepared ahead of the forthcoming European Council already touch on the course I have just outlined, but to my feeling not sufficiently.", "Let me conclude by quoting from Robert Schuman's legendary Declaration of May 9, 1950:
