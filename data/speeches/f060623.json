whether fair and transparent practices are being observed by financial intermediaries.", "While specific grievances relating to deficiency in financial services can be a matter for consumer courts or the concerned ombudsman, from a systemic point of view, it is recognised that services have to be benchmarked against codes and standards developed by all stakeholders and as a matter of public policy.", "In this context, an organisation such as the FPSB India whose mission is the development and promotion of standards for financial planning professionals to benefit among others, the general public is indeed timely and relevant.", "The FPSB needs to be congratulated for holding this Congress, which I am sure, will throw up a number of issues keeping in view the central theme viz.", "the

basis.", "Accordingly, he set up the Standing Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services under the able and sagely Chairmanship of Shri S.S.Tarapore.", "The approach of the

cheques , banks are required to formulate and disclose their policy for affording immediate credit, time frame for collection and interest payment for delayed collection, taking care to ensure that

standards set by the banks themselves.", "Compensation by way of interest payment, where necessary, should be made without any claim from the customer.", "\u2022 Banks are required to provide both the

affect the right or claim which any person may have against the survivor(s) / nominee to whom the payment is made.", "In such cases insistence on production of legal representation is unwarranted and would, invite serious supervisory disapproval.", "In such case, therefore, while making payment to the survivor(s) / nominee of the deceased depositor, the banks have to desist from insisting on production of succession certificate, letter of administration or probate, etc., or obtain any bond of indemnity or surety from the survivor(s)/nominee, irrespective of the amount standing to the credit of the deceased account holder.", "In case where the deceased depositor had not made any nomination or for the accounts other than those styled as \"either or survivor\" (such as single or jointly operated accounts), banks have been told to adopt a simplified procedure for repayment to legal heir(s) of the depositor keeping in view the imperative need to avoid inconvenience and undue hardship to the common person.", "In this context, banks may, keeping in view their risk management systems, fix a minimum threshold limit, for the balance in the account of the deceased depositors, up to which claims in respect of the deceased depositors could be settled without insisting on production of any documentation other than a letter of indemnity.", "\u2022 In the case of term deposits, banks are advised to incorporate a clause in the account opening form itself to the effect that in the event of the death of the depositor, premature termination of term deposits would be allowed.",

the treatment of pipeline flows in the name of the deceased account holder.", "Banks are advised to settle the claims in respect of deceased depositors and release payments to survivor(s) / nominee(s)

offices has more than doubled to 13,483 during the quarter ended March 31, 2006.", "This increase could be attributed to the complainants tending to approach the Ombudsman's office or RBI directly instead of first approaching the concerned bank's internal machinery for redressal.", "There is an urgent need for banks to strengthen their own internal grievance redressal machinery and set up nodal officials at various centres.", "Banks should give wide publicity to the names/contact addresses etc.", "of such nodal officers so that members of public can forward their grievances to these

FPC.", "Ensuring reasonableness of bank charges As the Reserve Bank was receiving several representations from public about unreasonable service charges being levied by banks, it was felt that the existing institutional mechanism in this regard is not adequate.", "Accordingly, and in order to ensure fair practices in banking services, the RBI has recently issued instructions to banks making it obligatory for them to display and continue to keep updated, in their offices/branches as also in their website, the details of various services charges in a format prescribed by it.", "The Reserve Bank has also decided to place details relating to service charges of individual banks for the most common services in its website.", "Furthermore, Reserve Bank has since constituted a working group headed by the Banking Ombudsman, Mumbai and including nominee of IBA and representatives of customers to formulate a scheme for ensuring reasonableness of bank charges and to incorporate this in the Fair Practices Code, the compliance of which will be monitored by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI).", "Customer service - institutional machinery In the area of customer service, the institutional machinery in banks should comprise - At the Board level, every bank has been asked to constitute a Customer Services committee of the Board including as invitees experts and

customer service headed by the CMD/ED into a Standing Committee that periodically reviews the policies and procedures and working of the bank's own grievance redressal machinery.", "These committees have been found to be very useful as the CEO of the bank and his top management team is singularly focused on matters relating to customer services at the meetings of these committees and decisions for improving services tend to get taken instantly, cutting across different departments.", "Each bank is expected to have a nodal department/ official for customer service in the HO and each

part of their corporate social responsibility.", "I had recently visited a cooperative society having linkages to women SHGs in urban slums, where the borrower was counselled in a full day program, on the implications of the loan, how the interest is calculated and so on, so that she is totally aware of its features.", "I wish the banks would have similar program for their clientele including farmers.", "There is clearly a lot to be done in this area.", "Advisory services Finally, given the vision and mission of the Financial Planning Standards Board India, I would urge the Board to develop standards for financial advisory services covering marketing, advisory and counselling.", "While doing so the Board may specifically look at possible areas of conflict of interest between selling and advising.", "In this context, I would draw reference to a recent report on 'Conflict of interest in financial services' of a group set up by RBI, available on our website.", "The FPSB
