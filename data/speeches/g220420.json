like Odysseus lashing himself to the mast of his ship - then this is in principle an effective way of easing monetary conditions, even when the policy rate itself can't be lowered any further.", "It's striking that this \"Odyssean\" guidance has received much more attention in the economics literature - but, in the real world, and despite often being right up against the lower bound, central banks have used it only rarely.", "This may be because, in practice, it's quite difficult to make credible commitments of this sort (and because central banks have also been able to use QE).", "Whatever the reason, most \"forward guidance\" has been of the \"Delphic\", more conditional form.", "Yet my impression is that outside observers can sometimes mistake one for the other: the \"if\" clause is forgotten, or downplayed, and purely conditional statements somehow get interpreted (or rather misinterpreted) as hard commitments.", "It's not entirely clear why this is the case.", "It may be quite a deep-seated tendency.", "Some psychological research demonstrates that people can misconstrue \"if...then\" statements, particularly if they're fairly abstract.", "It may also be wishful: because people don't like uncertainty and would therefore prefer there to be some fixed path of interest rates set in advance, perhaps they're prone to believe that this is what they're being told.", "But there's no doubt it happens.", "In September 2013, the MPC said that a minimum necessary condition for a rise in interest rates was that unemployment should fall below 7%.", "This was not a sufficient condition and the Committee was also at pains to emphasise that the actual path of rates would depend on the outlook for the economy at the time.", "Yet quite a few observers viewed the condition as a hard trigger and were confused when rates didn't immediately and automatically rise in response (memorably, one MP subsequently likened the Committee to \"an unreliable boyfriend, blowing hot and cold\").", "Similarly, in a speech in July , the then-Governor Mark Carney said the \"the decision as to when to [start raising interest rates] will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of the year\".", "This was no more than suggestive and was immediately qualified with a remark about the importance of economic developments in the interim: \"I am conscious of several important considerations which mean the actual path [of interest rates] almost certainly will not be mechanical, linear or pre-determined.", "First and foremost, shocks to the economy could easily adjust the timing and magnitude of interest rate increases....There is, in fact, a wide distribution of possible outcomes around any expected path for Bank Rate, reflecting the inevitability that the economy will be buffeted by shocks and that monetary policy will have to adjust accordingly.\"", "Yet when - thanks precisely to such shocks - interest rates did not subsequently rise \"around the turn of the year\", he was criticised for having misled people.", "Such criticisms, whether justified or not, are par for the course, and may not be that consequential in the grand scheme of things.", "But there could be a more material cost if, in mistaking conditional for unconditional statements, people come to rely on them at the expense of thinking about the economy, and its implications for interest rates, for themselves.", "As I said earlier, it's an important part of the transmission of policy, and of the stability of demand more generally, that prices in financial markets respond to economic news as it comes in, without the need for any prompting by the central bank.", "That is precisely the purpose of the \"Delphic\" sort of guidance that, in the main, central banks have employed.", "But as Chart 3 demonstrates, the sensitivity of market interest rates to releases of economic data seems to have declined somewhat in recent years.", "Chart 3: The sensitivity of market interest rates to news in economic data has fallen in Sensitivity of 3-year spot rates to economic data news: coefficient in regressions of change in the interest rate to change in a data surprise index prepared by Bank staff, using 12-month rolling windows.", "Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Refinitive Datascope and Bank calculations.", "There could, of course, be several explanations for this.", "It may well be that, precisely because the economy seems less predictable than it was during the \"Great Moderation\", markets are understandably more reluctant to infer things about the medium term from shorter-term data.", "The fact that central banks have for so long been pressed up against the lower bound would also naturally have attenuated the reaction of forward rates to news about the economy (they can't fall as far as they usually would in response to negative news).", "But it's possible that an over-reliance on central bank communication, and a misinterpretation of it as a fixed plan for interest rates, has contributed to this as well.", "If you believe that the monetary authority will always tell you in advance what it's going to do you may feel less inclined to anticipate and price such a response yourself[6].", "I don't know if this is true.", "It's really no more than a conjecture, and a relatively idle one at that.", "But it would be an irony if an effort to get people to think more about how monetary policy might respond to events, by communicating something akin to a \"reaction function\", had actually had the opposite effect.", "At any rate, having already gone through at some length the point I want to make, the rest just fills in some gaps.", "I'll start with a more formal description of \"Odyssean\" guidance, explaining why, when the interest rate is up against the lower bound, there could be very significant gains to credible commitments to keep rates low in future -

more exactly the (mis)interpretation of conditional as unconditional statements - in the outside world.", "But I think it's clear enough that central banks have rarely if ever committed themselves unconditionally to future policy.", "It's clear too that, on several occasions, the outside world has nonetheless viewed these statements as promises.", "I'll give some examples before a short concluding section.", "Credible, \"low-for-long\" guidance as a means of easing policy at So let's start with the value of commitment when the policy rate is close to the lower bound.", "As you know, the last thirty years have seen a marked decline, around the world, in the underlying, \"equilibrium\" real rate of interest (sometimes called \"R*\").", "This a real phenomenon, not a monetary one, caused by some combination of a greater desire to save -

less responsive to inflation overshoots in particular - than the red.", "So although I've been stressing the contingent nature of \"Delphic\" guidance, and the relative invariance in the case of commitment, it's not a rigid distinction.", "In any case, perhaps there's always some room for interpretation when it comes to language.", "That said, I think one can still outline some broad parameters - things that colour a statement more in one shade than another - that can help distinguish the two.", "For example, Odyssean, committed guidance is probably more likely to refer to dates - a time-frame for low interest rates - than to economic conditions alone.", "If it does tie future policy to economic variables it may explicitly pick out inflation expectations (as Odyssean guidance is explicitly designed to raise them).", "More generally, it will actively seek to convey a more dovish stance relative to incoming data.", "Without these things, a statement that simply says \"we expect such-and-such a policy to be appropriate given the current outlook\" doesn't seem to me to qualify, especially if it goes on to stress the dependence of one on the other.", "The same goes for forecasts of future interest rates based on the latest projections for the economy.", "These are just an effort to explain more about the \"reaction function\".", "On these grounds, and even with a fairly liberal interpretation of these requirements, it's difficult to pick out many episodes that clearly count as pre-commitment.", "Perhaps the US Fed's communications during and in the years after the financial crisis came the closest, though the shift to more Odyssean-like guidance was as much evolutionary as revolutionary.", "The FOMC had begun to signal the likelihood of a long period of low interest rates as early as December 2008, though to begin with, this was phrased simply as what would be justified by the economic outlook: \"Weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time\" The following summer, the statement still explained the outlook for policy as a normal and justifiable response to that for the economy, but for the first time introduced specific timelines: \"The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions...are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013\".", "Some years later, by 2012, the FOMC was indicating not only a time horizon for low rates but had added two important extra ingredients -
