credible monetary policy, protects us against the risk of inflation and the risk of deflation.", "You know our wellestablished concept: we are never pre-committed, and our interest rates are always designed to deliver price stability in line with our definition and the anchoring of expectations.", "Would the ECB go as far as introducing also other liquidity operations, for example 12-month

entrepreneurial spirit, which is shared by society as a whole, needs to be allowed to develop fully through structural reforms aimed at increasing the flexibility of the economy.", "What more should be done to increase growth?", "For instance, reducing protection in non-tradable sectors and monopolies, approving the liberalisation of closed professions, higher pension age, making labour markets more flexible and an overall increase in productivity?", "A lot of things can be done, in particular but not exclusively the liberalisation of closed professions, improved flexibility of the labour markets, improved education and training, and measures to boost innovation.", "How do you evaluate the fact that Italy is going to have a primary surplus as a percentage of GDP from next year

to restore a better transmission of our monetary policy, because some markets or segments are disrupted and not functioning properly.", "These disruptions, in the case of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), are due to the fact that governments, individually, still have to ensure their full credibility in the markets, and that the peer surveillance called for by the Stability and Growth Pact was not exercised correctly.", "It was on the basis of the commitments of 21 July made by the EU Heads of State or Government that the Governing Council of the ECB decided to activate the SMP, taking into account the commitment of governments to give the EFSF the capacity to intervene on the secondary market.", "Are you buying sovereign bonds to help Italy in particular?", "We are embarking
