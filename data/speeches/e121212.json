and occasionally guidance - matters.", "Guidance in normal times to help achieve the monetary policy goal In a perfect world, guidance would be unnecessary.", "The inherent uncertainty in economic outcomes and thus in the policy path would be widely understood.", "With full information and efficient markets, monetary policy expectations would effectively take care of themselves -
