because more capital is required against risky assets, and capital is costly.", "Requests for more capital buffers come from all international regulating bodies, both at the global level (Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee) and at the European level (Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM), as a shield against a new, devastating financial crisis.", "Up to now, in Europe the effect has been procyclical: notwithstanding the cheap, abundant liquidity supplied by the ECB, banks are reluctant to increase lending to the real economy.", "The corporate sector, especially in southern Europe, is mostly made up of SMEs, for which access to financial and capital markets is difficult, if not impossible.", "Hence, we have an inconsistent trio: an economic structure mostly requesting bank finance, regulators concerned with the risks posed by banks\" activity, and banks consequently stepping back from ample parts of the credit markets.", "How to sort ourselves out?", "One way is to move the European financial structure from intermediaries towards markets (Visco, 2015).", "This will indeed require national efforts, but more is needed: an integrated European-wide capital market, with harmonised and SMEfriendly rules.", "In other words, a CMU.", "The second question is: can we consider a European CMU a realistic project?", "This time my answer is much more doubtful.", "The idea for a CMU was first put forward by the President of the European Commission before the European Parliament in July 2014 (Juncker, 2014), in very ambitious language.", "Last September the Commission presented an action plan to transform that enlightened vision into reality (EC, 2015).", "From one document to the other the degree of ambition was apparently scaled down.", "As Nicolas Ve\u0301ron (2015) recently noted, the plan \"mostly boils down to pruning existing rules and correcting some of [the] EU\"s own recent regulatory overreach\".", "But this is supposed to be the normal business of the Commission.", "Let\"s check whether this harsh judgment is well founded.", "What does CMU mean in substance?", "It means creating a single market of non-bank financial services: the belated completion of the Single Market project of the \"80s.", "A first attempt at merging European financial markets fifteen years ago did not succeed.", "In the goods market the main obstacles to integration were technical standards: harmonising them was the crucial move.", "In the financial services market, obstacles are of various kinds: every country has its own legal system, tax treatment, accounting standards, and prudential regulation (Danielsson et al., 2015).", "These specificities are entrenched with local costumes and traditions, and in some cases they protect national champions.", "Harmonising the myriad of laws, taxes, and regulations in a short period of time, as the urgency of the matter would require, is extremely challenging.", "The most delicate problem has to do with the UK.", "It's quite obvious that a European CMU excluding the City of London would have little sense.", "But the UK Government is highly sensitive about London's competitive advantage as the financial hub of Europe, and the issue will remain almost intractable until the referendum on the UK remaining part of the European Union is held.", "The third question is: what can be done to facilitate/accelerate the process of creating a panEuropean CMU?", "The approach followed by the action plan is a step-by-step one.", "Such an approach was recommended, not by chance, by most of the stakeholders involved in a wide public consultation held by the Commission in the first half of this year.", "Is it the right approach?", "In principle, one might have preferred a bolder attitude, one that addressed simultaneously and directly all the needed harmonisation in the fields, for instance, of bankruptcy laws, taxes, investor protection and market infrastructure regulations: a Thatcher-like \"big bang\".", "But that would have been definitely unrealistic.", "What the action plan intends to do, and I quote a key passage of the document, is to proceed \"from the bottom up, identifying barriers and knocking them down one by one, creating a sense of momentum\".", "Among those to be knocked down first are, according to the plan: \u2022 red tape and information asymmetries making it too costly for SMEs to list on equity and debt markets; \u2022 specific rules in both the new European insurance regulatory framework (Solvency 2) and in the capital requirement regulation for banks (CRR) preventing insurance companies and banks from getting more involved in the business of financing infrastructure investment;
