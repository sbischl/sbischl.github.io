b) NBS' measures did not destabilize our banking sector - reserve requirement on domestic savings has remained at 40%; c) and the bank ownership structure has proved adequate in times of crisis.", "For Serbia, a key question remains - what further steps to take in view of the global economic turmoil: 1.", "We should finally understand that the current macroeconomic policy cannot be continued: it is completely unrealistic to expect that the time of a) cheap foreign funds and b) plentiful foreign investment will suddenly return to help us finance our current account deficit of 15 - 20%.", "Now is the time of reckoning, and the sooner we accept this fact, the better it will be for all concerned: enterprises, banks, households, state, etc.", "We must admit that current challenges are fast spilling over to Serbia, first as psychological effects and, as of late, as economic effects as well;

- The drafting of the Memorandum between the Government of the Republic of Serbia, National Bank of Serbia and Deposit Insurance Agency relating to stability and liquidity of the financial sector is expected to complete this week.", "The Memorandum will contain not only concrete mechanisms, but also exact figures.", "- Full support of international financial institutions to Serbia will continue in 2009: European Investment Bank: loans to SMEs;
