the Central Bank used to mop up liquidity from the financial market on a daily basis.", "The forward looking plan of our various institutions of higher learning to offer courses in Islamic finance related subjects that have enable a steady supply of talent and workforce to the industry.", "Equity-based financing Let me touch on the subject of equity-based financing.", "This subject has captured the imagination of many especially within the academic circles.", "Some even went to the extent of saying equity-based financing is the heart and soul of Islamic finance.", "This is a point that will invite a lot of comments and a subject of endless conversation.", "In practice, somehow, bankers are not into this.", "In Malaysia and in the Middle East, however, more than 70% are debt-based financing.", "Let me discuss this point with greater detail.", "For the benefit of those who are less familiar, in a nutshell Mudharaba is a profit sharing and loss bearing concept where the Financier provides financial investment in a business and the Entrepreneur provides expertise in running the business.", "The financier gets to share profits and absorb loses and the entrepreneur have a share of the profit Musharaka is where both Financier and Entrepreneur commit to invest financially in a business.", "In both cases, the profits and losses are shared according to ratios that both Financier and Entrepreneur agrees prior to the venture.", "In practice, these financing concepts can cover several aspects.", "Banks invest in a business venture with an entrepreneur and receive profit/loss sharing (e.g.", "in a corporate banking transaction).", "Depositors invest in a Bank and earn profit/loss sharing (e.g.", "when consumers want to open a mudharabah account).", "Banks invest in a business venture with an Entrepreneur and then finance the product of the business venture to consumers (e.g.", "Bank enters into partnership with Entrepreneur to build houses and sells the house to consumer thru a financing package).", "The structure seem quite established and generally accepted.", "Yet since 2006, despite equity-based transaction has become more popular, it only constituted only 2% of total financing.", "In fact, in our effort to motivate the industry to engage in more equity-based financing, a specific guideline dealing with mudharabah and musyarakah was issued on 21 September 2007.", "From our observation, we need a lot of room for improvement in this particular area.", "Sales based contract remains significant portion of financing - around 50%, 30% being Ijarah.", "A large proportion of Islamic finance domestically is therefore debt or asset based financing.", "Why the industry did not focus more on equity based financing?", "Should Islamic banks which are relatively small in size take this major shift in direction?", "A new direction not just for Islamic banks, but a new direction in the way Islamic finance should develop forward.", "Is there an impediment?", "If so - what is the impediment and is it something that we can solve?", "Or is it a natural phenomena?", "Are players in the industry not aware of the benefits?", "Or are they aware of the benefits, weighed it against the potential risks and decided not to pursue this strategy because of business and operational reasons?", "First let's analyze the potential benefit.", "For example, a Bank enters into a joint venture with a housing developer.", "The financing of the project in the form of equity can yield a lucrative return when the development is completed and then sold.", "Margin for profit upon sale can be high, as Bank enters into the development at the earliest chain of production.", "The Bank can still provide financing for the home purchasers, the difference this time - the homes are the Bank's own asset.", "Those are direct impact; there are positive impacts in other key areas as well.", "What happens to the profit from sales and financing?", "It gets channeled back to Depositors (giving them higher returns on the deposits).", "This concept would, completely, according to equity-based financing proponent, move Islamic banks away from mimicking conventional products and would truly operate as the shariah had wanted it.", "Is this true, are there any other factors to be considered?", "In terms of risk assessment, such a transaction will necessarily inject greater market discipline among industry players.", "This business model is premise on a few fundamental assumptions.", "The Bank and its staff will have to be good at risk assessment, due diligence, assets valuation, good at project financing and management, a good landlord, skillful in project monitoring and have the necessary expertise on specific areas such as construction, agriculture, manufacturing, fishing and other industries.", "Under this model, the banks created are very specialized with a set of expertise that they are not trained and possess.", "Its an entirely new \"ball game\".", "Currently 71%, the bulk of financing in Islamic finance is fixed, only 29% is on a floating rate.", "In conventional, only 26% is fixed.", "This gives rise to the issue of mismatching.", "For as long as source of funds for Banks is floating and its asset gives fixed return, the risk of funding cost being more expensive than income is a very real possibility.", "Rate of Return Risk and DCR will become a challenge to overcome.", "Would an equity based approach significantly remove such risk?", "Most likely, it is an area of where the practitioners can develop and explore.", "Or whether the benefits of equity-based financing would outweigh the risks associated with the obviously higher risks posed by the structure.", "The shift from asset based financing to equity based financing does not mean that Islamic banks will operate without any risks.", "Whilst the risk of mismatching between floating and fixed will be greatly reduced, it does also mean that Islamic banks will be taking the unprecedented step of actually owning the assets for which they are financing.", "So the question then is - should Islamic banking be the conduit for this sort of financing model?", "When the business climate is good then the answer is yes - but in an environment where certain sectors decline significantly such as the property market, it could adversely impact Islamic finance institutions, that could that suddenly finds itself saddled with assets that it cannot sell.", "There are ways to minimize such inventory risk - but we are making a big assumption here that ALL Islamic banks will behave rationally at all times.", "Although clearly Mudharaba and Musharaka should be in the Islamic Bank's toolbox, in taking a wholesale view to move towards asset based financing - it is imperative to look at the overall implication of such a shift.", "For the purpose of discussion, let's consider for the moment that the entire economy is premised on asset based financing.", "We must ask ourselves, in that scenario - would a financial system purely based on profit from equity based financing be necessarily more efficient than one based on asset financing or debt?", "Does it benefit the entire Ummah?", "Consider this possibility - who would have better information on business climate - the Entrepreneur, the Bank or the Client?", "Remember the asymmetry of information?", "A shift from the debt based financing to equity based financial system does not, necessarily lead to a better equitable outcome to society; instead, if not properly implemented it could cause uneven benefits to various stakeholders.", "The reason is that in the new system the risk-averse Clients will be crowded out of the market, allowing the risk-taking individuals to gain the most from a profit-sharing system because they have better access to information.", "The costs may outweigh the benefits.", "Let us now analyze the Business and Bank's perspective and the client's perspective.", "Here we are talking about the potentially real issues - the practical aspects that Banks, Entrepreneurs and Clients will face.", "Firstly, in terms of information asymmetry, banks will need to have perfect information on the Entrepreneur.", "This cuts both ways - Clients of the Banks will need to have perfect information on the Banks as well.", "Banks will need to keep detailed records and then reveal such information to their Client and Entrepreneur.", "Of course we need transparency - but when transparency requirement start to conflict with giving out information to your competitors (perhaps in conventional banking), then this could have a serious impact on competitiveness.", "Requirement for information will certainly result in an increase in costs - which is then passed on to customers, potentially causing services to be more expensive.", "This could result in Islamic Banks losing its competitive edge.", "We should also question what is the expertise of the Bank?", "Would the Bank possess sufficient expertise to invest in a business venture?", "If it does not have the expertise or take an active role - then the Bank is merely financing the business venture.", "That is no different from debt based financing.", "Now let's take a closer look at the Client's perspective.", "Firstly, if the Bank is operating on purely equity based financing - return on deposits will be based on the Bank's performance.", "Now how many of us here invest our life savings in the stock market?", "Because that is essentially a rather crude way of presenting an example of what a pure equity based financing system may bring.", "It is of course possible for the authorities to guarantee your deposit in the Islamic Bank a depositor choose to \"invest\" - but this would no longer be in the spirit of and Mudharaba.", "But another point that needs to be considered is this.", "Are banks the best entity to provide equity-based financing.", "Would it be more suitable for a joint venture company, a partnership or a private equity funds to undertake this venture?", "Shouldn't we develop these marketbased institutions to be the conduit for such an endeavour.", "Since market-based institutions do not have the fiduciary responsibility to depositors.", "Should we leave the banks which were created to play an intermediary role to continue to perform the function which they are good at.", "Wouldn't the financial stability aspect be a consideration on whether banks are allowed to venture into equity-based financing?", "Shouldn't we expand an entirely new Islamic finance industry that specialises in equity-based financing?", "I asked plenty of questions that I don't have ready answers but I hope enough to force you to ponder into thinking this issue from a multiple dimensions.", "The good news is we are at a stage of growth in terms of product and service in Islamic finance.", "That means innovation is still the driving force behind the industry progress.", "The questions posed today is not meant to deter nor to direct in which direction we ought to be moving - but to provoke new thoughts in moving forward.", "The fact of the matter is that debt based financing is generally accepted and approved by Shariah scholars and currently forms an integral part of Islamic finance and its structured was tested in our legal system.", "These instruments have been adopted by the IDB and many Sovereigns to finance infrastructure investments, to promote trade and to meet liquidity needs in Muslim countries.", "In other words, debt-based financing has been successfully deployed to bring economic benefit to fellow Muslims.", "There is no doubt that Equity based financing needs to be considered and its usage encouraged.", "At the same time we must do so with the full knowledge of its full consequence on the entire financial system stability as it currently stands.", "Perhaps splitting hairs on whether we should focus more on asset based or equity based financing pales in comparison to other issues, such as encouraging mutual recognition on diversity of thoughts and ideas in Islamic finance, enhance the inter linkages between Islamic financial centers, so that economies that have surplus funds could be channel to economies that are short of funding and that those excess funds could be invested in productive manner.", "Perhaps, we should be patient in developing Islamic finance, moving forward.", "Patience does have its own virtue.", "I remember the days when the financing for purchases of houses are purely based on murabahah concept, but now we have musyarakah mutanaqisah, a structure that is very close to equity-based type of financing structure.", "Malaysia since 1983 has established a comprehensive Islamic financial system.", "We have suitable legal, tax, shariah, regulatory and supervisory framework institutions and the right talent to bring Islamic finance to the next level of development.", "If there is a gap - we are in a position to fix that gap.", "But the world as you know it has never remained static, the agility and the commitment to change would determine the ability of Malaysian Islamic financial system to remain competitive and relevant.", "On that note, I wish you all the best and I am confident this forum will make a tremendous contribution to the overall growth in Islamic finance."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
