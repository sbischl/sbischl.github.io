and not just in Ireland but across the European Union (EU) and beyond - require long-term thinking about the growth and resilience of our economic capital.", "And the nature of those challenges also requires more integrated and multi-disciplinary thinking.", "None of the individual stocks of capital exist in in a vacuum.", "To meet these structural challenges, policy frameworks need to invest in developing an integrated analytical framework that brings together different disciplines, maintaining their individual strengths but also leveraging their synergies.", "For example, as Diane Coyle wrote recently , \"one of the lessons from the pandemic must be the high cost of not having better integrated social, medical and natural science research.", "There has been great work across disciplines, on the hoof -

and continuing with climate change as an example - we should be looking at our existing measures of debt sustainability against the investment required to manage the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.", "In highlighting the challenges of the 'green transition', the EU's Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF) recognises the pivotal role of fiscal policy in achieving this objective.", "It also points to an important differentiation between expenditure - which often has an automatic or stabilisation focus - and investment (in the four capitals), which has implications for growth, productivity and resilience, and thus for longer-term debt sustainability.", "This means moving beyond a sole focus on the Structural Budget Balance and recognises the importance of the composition of investment and expenditure as well as its size.", "(I would argue that the assets on a sovereign's balance sheet are also relevant when taking a longer term perspective: net worth is a good indicator of sustainability.)", "An important focus of economic policy should be to build resilience to systemic risks and to the transitions that have already started.", "As we build that resilience, we also need to continue to learn from, and adapt to, events as they unfold.", "Many of our most important macroeconomic policy frameworks were developed 30 years ago.", "As we contemplate the future -
