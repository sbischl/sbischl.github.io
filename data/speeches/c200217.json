on imports based on a product's carbon footprint.", "The ambition is an equal carbon price for all products whether produced in or outside the EU.", "Even though the EU accounts for a diminishing share of global emissions, this could also affect emissions in other parts of the world, including emerging economies.", "While climate policy is being strengthened in a number of countries, the international picture is also one of resistance to the introduction of effective measures.", "A stricter climate policy also raises difficult discussions about burden sharing - not least between mature advanced economies and emerging economies.", "It is not surprising then that the EU's carbon tax plans are being met with accusations of protectionism.", "So far, it has been difficult to

unlikely to occur without higher emissions.", "The climate issue is therefore in large part about how poor countries can achieve solid economic growth without a continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions.", "With the rise in emissions we have seen, the world will have to prepare for and adapt to a warmer climate.", "At the same time, climate change impacts are becoming increasingly evident.", "This may lead to abrupt policy shifts.", "Businesses, banks and investors are paying more attention to this risk.", "The PERSPECTIVES outlook for offshore activities on the Norwegian shelf

unlike during the financial crisis and the downturn in the early 2000s, growth remained positive and registered unemployment did not exceed 3 percent.", "The mildness of the downturn following the oil

structure of the Norwegian credit market, where floating interest rates predominate, the policy rate is an effective tool.", "The inflation targeting regime must be flexible.", "Norges Bank's close to 20 years' experience with inflation targeting suggests that a small, open economy must expect inflation to deviate fairly widely from the target from time to time.", "However, inflation has remained within a range where deviations from the target cannot be said to have entailed material economic costs.", "This has provided leeway to give weight to other considerations in interest-rate setting.", "During the most recent downturn, the krone exchange rate fell in pace with oil prices.", "This led to prospects for higher inflation.", "The prevailing confidence in the monetary policy framework and wage formation proved to be of benefit.", "As long as we were certain that the rise in inflation was temporary, monetary policy could look through the rise.", "From autumn 2014, the policy rate was lowered in four steps, by a total of 1 percentage point.", "But in an economy marked by structural changes, monetary policy could not fully counteract the effects on output and employment.", "In recent years, economic activity in Norway has picked up again, and the rate cuts following the oil price fall have been reversed.", "By comparison, policy rates among many of our trading partners are still negative more than ten years after the financial crisis.", "Monetary policy has been stretched thin internationally.", "can be very effective when the economy features high unemployment, and very low interest rates alone do not provide sufficient stimulus.", "In Norway, there is a long tradition of fiscal policy support in stabilising the economy.", "The GPFG has increased our fiscal space.", "As in the downturn in the early 2000s and during the financial crisis, oil revenue spending over the central government budget was stepped up markedly during the most recent, oil-driven downturn.", "An active countercyclical policy with high spending in downturns must be followed by a reversal or tightening measures when economic indicators point to a recovery.", "However, because the value of the fund has steadily risen, we have long been spared the more demanding tightening measures.", "This may not be the case in the years ahead.", "Oil revenue spending over the central government budget has reached a high level.", "As mentioned, we must take into account the possibility that developments in global financial markets may be weaker than in recent years, with a possible downward correction in equity markets.", "This will reduce the value of the GPFG.", "In addition, Norway is facing demographic challenges that will put pressure on government finances ahead.", "The government also has a responsibility for the balance between the public and private sector.", "Since 2014, public consumption and investment have risen to a recordhigh share of mainland GDP (Chart 14).", "The krone depreciation over the past years has entailed a sharp increase in the GPFG's value in krone terms.", "This has increased the government's domestic purchasing power.", "However, a krone depreciation does not increase our national wealth.", "In the years ahead, we need a larger non-oil tradable sector.", "If that sector is to expand, it must be given room to grow.", "If the government lays claim to a growing share of available production resources, the room for growth will diminish.", "The government must therefore be especially cautious about increasing public spending on the basis of a krone-driven rise in the fund's value.", "Chart 14 Strong growth in public demand.", "At the same time, higher import prices have given Norwegian customers an incentive to shift

oil investment.", "Seafood exports have recently set new records in krone terms, but exports have remained flat for several years in volume terms, partly because of salmon lice problems.", "Capacity constraints have also hampered exports of metals and other capital-intensive manufactured goods.", "Profitability has clearly improved, but a considerable increase in production requires substantial investment, and it is only in the past few years that manufacturing investment has shown a pronounced pick-up.", "The large foreign assets that we have accumulated mean that we can run a trade deficit when oil and gas revenues eventually decline.", "Recent developments nevertheless suggest that we have become more dependent on the return on those assets for financing tomorrow's imports (Chart 16).", "Chart 16 Growing dependence on the GPFG.", "It should be noted, however, that a substantial share of Norway's goods and services imports is related to activity on the Norwegian shelf.", "These imports will decline as oil activities wind down.", "On the other hand, lower oil prices or a decline in global equity markets will reduce the expected return on the GPFG.", "Moreover, the trade deficit has shown a substantial increase in a period where both demand in the Norwegian oil industry and the krone have weakened.", "For many years, Norwegian companies could afford to pay much higher wages than companies in neighbouring countries.", "Perhaps the ability to pay high wages has been more dependent on the oil industry than thought earlier.", "Going forward, the key to success for Norway will be the same as for other countries: We must make the most of our number one resource - labour.", "The value of Norway's human capital is around three times the sum of its natural
