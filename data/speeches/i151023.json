in mind, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Institute of Directors in Ireland are hosting this joint event to facilitate a broad discussion and sharing of ideas from theoretical, practical and regulatory perspectives.", "We look forward to hearing your opinions and experiences and we hope it will be an informative and thought-provoking forum.", "The Financial Stability Board's (FSB) defines

objectives.", "Exposure to risk is an inevitable part of doing business.", "Successful businesses take on and manage calculated risks in order to achieve their goals.", "The challenge is to identify the risks which the firm is able to take on, that is to say the risks which the executive team has the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience to manage, up to a degree which the firm has the wherewithal to withstand.", "A clearly defined risk appetite provides the directors, management and staff with a framework which facilitates the identification and management of risks.", "Strategic objectives should underpin the risk appetite statement.", "An effective risk appetite statement enables the assumption of risk in line with the strategic objectives of the organisation while giving

risk appetite statement, risk limits, and defining the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management.", "The FSB Principles are broad enough to allow financial institutions to develop a framework that is tailored to their institution, that reflects their business model and structure, and that can be adapted to changes in the economic and regulatory environment.", "On the industry side, in 2009 the IIF published \"Implementing Robust Risk Appetite Frameworks to Strengthen Financial Institutions\", which noted that risk appetite frameworks are an essential tool of risk management and highlighted the need for extensive judgment and challenge on the part of Boards and management in this respect.", "It is the role of board of directors to which I now turn.", "The role of directors The Financial Stability Board lists in its 2013 principles 12 tasks and responsibilities for the board of directors of financial firms with respect to the risk

Financial Reporting Council in the UK published a revised Corporate Governance Code (\"the Code\") along with two associated guidance documents.", "In respect of risk management the Code has been

responsibility to the board for monitoring the company's risk management and internal control systems.", "Good corporate governance, including proper risk appetite framework, is needed in any venture.", "But it is even more critical in firms that have a fiduciary duty.", "Financial firms are regulated for a reason: they hold liabilities towards their clients in the form of client assets, funds, or sums necessary to pay claims.", "This means that directors are required to extend their responsibilities beyond shareholders and take full account of the interests of depositors, policyholders, victims of accidents, and savers This is in keeping with the Basel Corporate Governance Principles for Banks which provide that a bank's board and senior management should \"protect the interests of depositors, meet shareholder obligations, and take into account the interests of other recognised stakeholders\".", "Having a risk appetite cognizant of these wider responsibilities is a key part of meeting them.", "Central bank of Ireland initiatives From a Central Bank perspective, the Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings includes a

both qualitative and quantitative terms to facilitate tracking of performance and compliance with agreed strategy.", "Risk appetite is also subject to annual review by the board.", "The Central Bank's experience, based on thematic work and reviews, is that such documentation is of variable quality and that the risk appetite may not always be embedded throughout the organisation.", "Further, we have noted varying degrees of skills, experience and knowledge with respect to risk and its management.", "In order to address these concerns the Central Bank has launched a series of initiatives aiming to advance understanding as to what an effective risk appetite encompasses and to establish what constitutes good practice in relation to setting risk appetite.", "In mid-2014, we published a Discussion

provided a useful insight into the current practices employed in the Irish financial services industry and the Central Bank would again like to acknowledge respondents' contributions.", "The benefits of a risk appetite framework All respondents agreed that organisations benefit from a risk appetite framework and concurred that it is necessary to align risk appetite with the goals and strategies of the business.", "However, the majority of respondents stated that the development of a formal risk appetite within their organisation was driven by regulatory and legislative obligations.", "While it is, of course, necessary to fulfil the regulatory requirements in this regard, it is disappointing that the benefits arising from the successful implementation of risk appetite framework are not more widely appreciated.", "Indeed, it is these benefits that drive so many non-financial services organisations which are not bound by such requirements to invest considerable time and effort in implementing an effective risk appetite framework.", "The Central Bank also recognises that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to the implementation of risk appetite within an organisation.", "It is widely acknowledged that risk appetite is organisation-specific and should reflect the nature, scale and complexity of the entity.", "It is this very diversity that prompted the Central Bank
