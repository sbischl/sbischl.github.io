how it ties in with the portfolio selection, which we will examine in more detail; and how the balance sheet assessment in turn relates to the subsequent stress tests.", "It should all lead to a single result, that will be published in October next year.", "What benchmark will this single result represent?", "We are not primarily aiming to quantify a capital gap.", "The main purpose of sifting through the banks' balance sheets is to restore international market confidence in them.", "The balance sheet assessment will hence be carried out in accordance with uniform guidelines.", "All institutions will be examined by the same methods.", "That is why we also have external consultants on board.", "Moreover, the supervisory teams in the countries will be linked to each other.", "The benchmark will not be a capital gap, the capital requirement?", "What else will it be?", "We will have a benchmark for the balance sheet assessment.", "That will be derived from European regulations, the Capital Requirements Regulation/Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRR/CRD IV).", "Those are the technical names.", "What do they refer to?", "The main issue is the definition of capital that a bank is required to keep on deposit.", "That is set down in the CRD IV.", "...which is based on the Basel III guidelines .", "It contains a minimum percentage of common equity capital that banks, under Basel III, must keep in proportion to their risk-weighted assets.", "It also states that banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer as a further cushion against risks.", "And since we are dealing with the most important banks in all Member States, the \"significant credit institutions\" require an extra buffer to reflect this significance in a European context.", "If you add that up, you arrive at the benchmark that we will use for orientation.", "In the final analysis, the most interesting point is the gap between a banks' capital adequacy requirement and the capital that it has available.", "We must apply uniform rules in Europe.", "It may emerge that a bank does not have adequate reserves or has not made sufficient provisions.", "That gap may need to be filled with capital, but it may also be removed through balance sheet shrinking.", "The situation will improve if we restore confidence: a bank will find it easier to raise funds in the market if there is transparency and certainty about its balance sheet.", "It will be difficult if many banks turn to the markets all at once.", "Most bankers are forward-looking and are already looking for capital.", "If private capital does not suffice, then the European guidelines state that the shortfall must be made up through a bail-in, with shareholders and creditors bearing losses.", "The state may not provide any funds before a bail-in has been carried out.", "Before any public money flows, however, a decision must have been taken on whether a bank is viable or not.", "A bank that is only able to keep afloat with sustained public support does not belong in our concept of a market economy.", "If the bank, or perhaps just one part of it, does have a chance of survival, public funds may be used as the third line of defence;
