its main weakness was not in its content but in the lack of implementation.", "Let me start with three bad reasons for that.", "A first explanation would be that Europe only moves forward in times of crisis.", "This is partly true: the Banking Union and the CMU are two examples of initiatives taken in the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt crises.", "Yet we should not wait complacently until the next crisis to act; it is precisely because we are not in an acute crisis situation that we should move forward now.", "Second, both initiatives can be described as arid and technical.", "This is not an issue in itself; we are accustomed to complex topics.", "But here we may have created a maze of technical and interconnected sub-topics, and lost sight of their original political purpose.", "Third and not least, national reflexes are still present, with countries reasoning vis-a\u0300-vis \"their\" banks and \"their\" financial centre.", "The result is that each European country, and the EU as a whole, are losing to the benefit of London and the United States - or to the benefit of foreign Bigtechs tomorrow.", "All in all we have to accept the idea that instead of a single European financial centre, we will have a polycentric network of financial centres - all the more since the digital era encourages it.", "And accept that there will be no winner-takes-all country, but several pan-European cross-border financial players.", "In this early 2022 nevertheless, there are at least four reasons to believe that we can breathe new life into Banking Union and CMU: There is growing awareness that European strategic autonomy matters and that financial sovereignty is part of it.", "This shift started with the Covid crisis but it is being underlined even more starkly now by geopolitics.", "The two \"great transformations\" ahead of us, digital and ecological, will require massive investments.", "This calls for common financing from not only public but also private sector.", "We should rebrand the CMU in a way that better reveals its goals: financing our two major transformations.", "I proposed some time ago to rebrand it \"Financing Union for Investment and Innovation\", or \"Financing Union for Sustainable Investment\" - Christine Lagarde suggested a \"Green Capital Markets Union\".", "At the inception of the single market in 1986, the genius of Jacques Delors and the Commission was to hoist over a collection of 300 technical texts the banner of the four freedoms of movement - goods, services, persons and capital.", "This banner gave a meaning and a purpose to the single market.", "I am convinced that the success of CMU, in particular, will not depend on an ever-improving technical agenda, but on a much stronger political ownership and impetus, from all European authorities.", "We need an enhanced \"private float\" to stabilise the Economic and Monetary Union.", "Fiscal and monetary policies have done a lot to support the economy since 2020, and can no longer be the only tools used to tackle these challenges.", "Recent openings in the position of several countries - especially along the Rhine, but also across the Alps - could hopefully offer the possibility to reach agreements.", "Finalising the Banking Union to strengthen our banks The following figures will illustrate our failure so far to offer the right conditions for pan-European banking groups to emerge.", "In 2020, the domestic market share of the top five US banks stood slightly below 50%, compared with around 25% for the top five in Europe.", "In 2021, amid a dynamic volume of mergers and acquisitions in Europe, domestic transactions accounted for circa 80% of completed deals from January to November;

otherwise, our international credibility and Basel 3 compliance would be harmed.", "Let me stress it for French and European bankers who are gathered here: accepting good compromises is often a sign of intelligence;
