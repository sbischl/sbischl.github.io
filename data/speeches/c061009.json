economy.", "So far in the cyclical upturn, the mainland economy has grown by an average of close to 4 per cent annually.", "At the same time, inflation has remained low as the upturn has also been

Norway.", "Price impulses from imported consumer goods are expected to continue to exert downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead, albeit to a lesser extent than in previous years.", "The

impression of positive expectations for 2006 and 2007.", "There are prospects for strong growth in the Government Pension Fund - Global.", "Given our assumption for oil price developments ahead (oil

a period of strong expansion in the Norwegian economy, somewhat lower petroleum revenue spending will be in line with the fiscal rule.", "Our projections are based on the assumption that fiscal policy

(I-44) has shown a rising trend, albeit with some degree of fluctuation.", "Since end-May this year, the krone has depreciated from strong values.", "So far in the third quarter, the krone exchange rate has been about 3 per cent weaker than projected in the June Inflation Report.", "Monetary policy assessments and strategy According to the monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 2/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 23\u20444 - 33\u20444 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 1 November, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections.", "The analyses in Inflation Report 2/06 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level.", "In the first six months of 2006, the

0.25 percentage point at the meeting of the Executive Board on 16 August.", "At its meeting on 27 September, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to leave the key rate unchanged at 3.00 per cent.", "The background for the decision was described as follows: \"There is little slack in the Norwegian economy.", "A steadily rising share of enterprises lacks the capacity to accommodate increased demand, largely because of labour shortages.", "The labour market has grown considerably tighter, and there are several signs that wage growth is picking up.", "Developments in aggregate demand, output and employment suggest a higher interest rate.", "At the same time, the rise in consumer prices is slowing, and the rise in prices excluding energy products is unexpectedly low.", "This suggests a continued low interest rate.\"", "The Executive Board's overall assessment was that the strategy published in the Report, coupled with new information, warranted that the interest rate should be left unchanged at this meeting.", "The uncertainty surrounding the interest rate forecasts is illustrated in the fan chart and indicates that monetary policy reacts to disturbances to the economy.", "This contributes to increasing the uncertainty surrounding future interest rates, but at the same time contributes to stabilising economic developments.", "Monetary policy cannot fine-tune economic developments, but it can prevent the largest effects from occurring when the economy is exposed to disturbances.", "In some situations, it may be appropriate to hedge against particularly unfavourable developments.", "In the baseline scenario, the interest rate is gradually raised to a more normal level.", "Norges Bank continuously assesses the effects of interest rate changes and
