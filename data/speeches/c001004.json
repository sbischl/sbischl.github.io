often shares this function with other currencies, particularly the dollar.", "Incidentally, those countries whose exchange rate policy is based on the euro tend, for the larger part, to have comparatively small foreign exchange reserves.", "It must also be recognised that international circumstances have made it difficult for the euro to gain a larger acceptance as a reserve currency.", "It was difficult to determine the risk-return profile for the new currency at the start of monetary union.", "Then, as events later proved, the euro had entered into the fray with other investment currencies at a time, when, for cyclical reasons, the interest rates in the euro area were exceptionally low and the dollar, a major rival, was receiving sustained support from the vigorous growth in the US economy.", "Since its introduction, the euro has lost considerable ground on the foreign exchange markets.", "This development stands not only in marked contrast to the remarkable internal stability of the new currency but is contrary to the expectations expressed by many market participants and experts in the run-up to monetary union.", "These expectations were based, in part, on the assumption that the dynamic growth in the US would cool off in 1999.", "Many forecasts had the US economy growing at a rate of only 2% in 1999.", "The slowdown envisaged by these forecasts was then

other authors have reached similar conclusions.", "Somewhat less recent studies by IMF or OECD staff also find evidence of a significant undervaluation.", "Looking for possible causes for the recent weakness of the euro, it will soon become apparent that the euro's exchange rate reacted asymmetrically to macroeconomic events on each side of the Atlantic.", "Thus, the successful passage of the tax reform bill in Germany was barely acknowledged in exchange rate movements while the surprisingly large growth in US GDP in the second quarter was reflected rather quickly in a corresponding fall in the euro exchange rate.", "Apparently, the uncertainties associated with the euro area received more attention than those affecting the US economy.", "Exchange rates do not, however, consistently move in only one direction.", "Cyclical developments may revive the diversification argument as a strategic consideration.", "Moreover, empirical studies support the view that the composition of foreign exchange reserves to some extent reflects the structure of external trade and financial ties.", "If the euro were to become more popular among private market participants, it might also significantly improve its fortunes as a reserve currency.", "These ten countries account for more than one-half of the world's foreign exchange reserves.", "They are all either Asian or Latin American countries whose economies are oriented more towards the dollar area than towards the euro area.", "See Alberola, E et al.", "Banking competition Before introducing the euro, investors in Europe dealt mainly with banks in their country of origin.", "The market share of branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks as a percentage of total assets of the banking system was below 11% in most EMU countries.", "This suggests that competition from outside was somewhat constrained.", "The currency union was consequently expected to foster competition in the banking sector.", "In particular, a reduction in excess capacities and an increase in efficiency was expected.", "A single monetary policy and a single currency could partly take away some of the informational and funding advantage of domestic banks and therefore diminish the need to maintain banking relationships in every country.", "This might lead to a reduction of branches and increased cross-border competition within the euro area.", "Whereas there is some evidence that in wholesale and investment banking, a concentration process in under way - even on a European base43 - retail banking seems to be still confined to the national level.", "This could be partly attributed to the lack of unified payment and settlement systems and to prevailing differences in the legal and financial environment.", "On the other hand, there was a real surge in takeover activities in the banking sector in 1999.", "Record values of mergers and acquisitions amounted to 149 billion euros last year and outnumbered M&A activites in the United States nearly twice over.", "Nevertheless, consolidation in the financial sector was mainly limited to the domestic scene.", "This might be due to the exploitation of cost reductions by trimming overlapping branch networks and excess capacity within a country and due to the gain in reputation largely confined within national borders.", "However, mergers tend to cut operating costs and reduce managerial inefficiencies and therefore might contribute to an increase in competition.", "By improving price transparency in financial services, the euro could further enhance competition among financial institutions.", "In fact, banks' interest rate margins, i.e.", "the difference between interest rate received and paid in terms of the balance sheet volume have declined in Germany to 1.28% in 1999 which marks a historical low.", "Concerning non-interest income, fees paid per unit by private bond issuers for intermediation services declined in 1999.49 This reduction in revenues may very well reflect increased competition within the market.", "Moreover competition owing to price transparency has been driven considerably by advances in information and communication technology such as electronic banking.", "The narrowing of interest margins and substitution effects on the liability side of See ECB (1999a), p 21.", "Exceptions are Luxembourg and Ireland with foreign market shares of over 50%.", "However, one should keep in mind that the consolidation process in the United States is already quite advanced.", "See Deutsche Bundesbank (2000a), p 45, and Deutsche Bundesbank (2000c), forthcoming.", "Last year's decline in France, Germany and Italy was 2, 17, and 15 basis points, respectively, on US$ issues, which now average about 0.2 per cent of the issue volume and was less pronounced for issues in euro.", "Note that this decline does not indicate a lower importance in fee-based income in the banking sector, since the overall level of non-interest income increased compared with revenues from interest margins.", "See also BIS (2000a), p 131. bank balance sheets together with the increase in off-balance sheet activities is an ongoing trend.", "Mutual recognition clauses owing to the Single European Market, favourable financial market legislation, technological progress, as well as the institutionalisation of savings clearly supported the integrating role of the euro.", "Summing up, currency union has contributed to the increasing competition in the domestic banking sectors but leaves scope for future activities to achieve a truly pan-European consolidation of financial intermediaries.", "Implications for monetary policy Two trends can be observed within the European financial system, despite all remaining national differences concerning legislation, taxation and the financial structure of enterprises.", "First, the importance of the capital markets has increased compared to bank-based intermediation.", "And second, competition among banks - at least on a national level - and between banks and capital markets has intensified.", "Concerning investors, there has been a noticeable increase in the share of wealth of private households and firms that is both liquid and traded.", "As a result, investors may now be more sensitive to market movements in general.", "Expectations about future inflation rates, shocks to the real sector and risk premiums are some of the factors influencing long-term interest rates.", "Since these factors are not determined by monetary policy alone, central bankers may face greater uncertainty in gauging the impact of a monetary policy move.", "The increasing share of tradeable assets in net wealth of private households dates back to the beginning of the nineties.", "However, the movement has been accelerating considerably over the last year.", "The broader distribution of equity holdings, owing largely to the boost of IPOs in the \"new markets\" can be more closely linked to currency union.", "This could foster wealth effects on consumer spending.", "Although the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth for equity holdings has been rather low in European countries,52 the elasticity of consumption with respect to wealth may increase.", "At least that is what the development in the United States shows.", "On the financing side, banks still play an important role as a source of external funds for companies in the European monetary union.", "However, monetary policy will have to face the trend towards more direct creditor-debtor relationships and thus possibly to resulting changes in the strength of different transmission channels.", "With the emergence of close substitutes for short-term bank deposits one might fear that the influence of monetary policy on bank deposit rates would be reduced.", "For Germany, however, in spite of the growth of money market funds and commercial paper, no such loss of influence was found during the nineties.", "On the contrary, there is some evidence that interest rates on bank loans and deposits adjust more readily to changes in central bank rates.", "Growing competition over funds - resulting from a broader variety of investment opportunities - amplified rather than dampened the impact of monetary impulses over the interest rate channel.", "The impact of the introduction of the euro and recent changes in the financial industry on the credit channel of monetary policy transmission is ambiguous.", "The increase in competition among financial institutions might tighten the supply of credit if monetary policy shifts to a restrictive stance.", "Fiercer competition is likely to reduce the buffer function of banks to a monetary policy contraction.", "This buffer can cause a delay in changes in the borrowing rate, which would reduce banks interest rate margins arising from the difference in deposit and lending rates.", "However, increased competition may lead to a further decline in the interest rate margin, thus not allowing banks to suffer from higher costs from isolating the real sector from a contractonary monetary policy.", "The impact of monetary policy will consequently be amplified.", "However, growing bond and equity markets will eventually provide companies with additional financial facilities.", "Although, in practice, financial constraints seem to be given by the amount of bank lending for most small and medium-sized enterprises,56 the favourable development of corporate bonds and of financing via the \"new markets\" may lead to a better substitution between both sources of funds.", "This reduces the importance of bottlenecks created by a shortage of bank credits and dampens the impact of the bank lending channel.", "Monetary impulses might be transmitted differently on more expectation-driven markets, which are largely influenced by real-sector developments.", "For example a restrictive monetary policy may not directly lead to a reduction of financing facilities for companies, but might rather influence the expectations of the future direction of real activity in the economy.", "This, in turn, might worsen the prospects for the company's future earnings and therefore reduce the returns of going public or bond issues.", "Finally, monetary expansion or contraction can be strengthened via the evaluation of collateral, which partly determines the creditworthiness of borrowing companies or households.", "The cost and amount of loans are assumed to depend on the net present value of collateral, which again is inversely related to the short-term interest rate.", "Whereas this balance sheet channel seems to be particularly strong in bank-dominated financial systems,57 it is not clear how changes on capital markets have affected the strength of this financial accelerator of the standard interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission.", "A rise in the share of tradeable assets in the balance sheets of companies as well as in the net wealth of private households enables additional borrowing with rising asset prices, whereas the creditworthiness of debtors is restricted by falling stock and property prices.", "Since tradeable assets react more readily to changes in monetary policy, its impact could be reinforced through revaluation of collateral, provided that asset prices move in the \"right\" direction, i.e.", "decline with a monetary contraction.", "On the other hand a shift towards a more market-oriented financial system may weaken the transmission process of monetary policy over banks' balance sheets.", "As capital markets grow and banks become increasingly exposed to competiton, financial instruments are becoming eligible as closer substitutes and also more tailored to the special needs of investors and borrowers.", "For example, external financing restrictions have been slightly lifted somewhat on new enterprises with little collateral, due to the boost provided by the \"new markets\".", "However, the development of the financial system might change the allocation of risk among market participants.", "Private households and institutional investors now increasingly bear the risk of corporate bonds.", "Markets can provide instruments to inform about and hedge against these risks.", "Nevertheless, in periods of change the performance of these mechanisms can be poor.", "Bearing in mind the interdependences between bank lending and asset prices,60 it is clear that observing developments on capital markets and taking into account stability implications resulting from asset price changes goes hand in hand with exerting supervisory duties over the banking sector.", "Central bankers will therefore keep a watchful eye on indicators reflecting credit as well as asset price risks.", "These considerations lead me to the following conclusions.", "First, the euro has intensified developments in the financial industry that argue in favour of a broad mandate for national central banks.", "They must ensure price stability and, at the same time, concern themselves with the stability of the financial system.", "Secondly I would like to point out that the euro-induced developments in the financial markets might change the relative importance of the different transmission channels in monetary policy.", "In my view, however, it is too early to answer the key question of whether the overall efficiency of monetary policy will be strengthened or weakened by these changes.", "And finally let me repeat a point I made at the very beginning.", "When we concentrate on euro-induced changes in external financing we should not overlook the fact that in many countries internal funding is the major source of corporate finance.", "Against this background, the euro is possibly making less of a change to monetary policy than would seem to be the case if we only focussed on the substitution between bank loans on the one side and corporate bonds and equities on the other side.", "Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the euro has worked as a catalyst for changes in the financial markets.", "(1999), Global Equilibrium Exchange Rates: Euro, Dollar \"Ins\", \"Outs\", and Other
