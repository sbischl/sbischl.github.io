intermediate target for achieving low and stable inflation.", "The exchange rate remained stable up to autumn 1996, partly because wage growth was low and overall demand did not generate pressures in the economy.", "Gradually, the krone began to show wider fluctuations.", "The experience of the last half of the 1990s demonstrated that monetary policy cannot fine-tune the exchange rate.",

with a floating krone is also increasing in Norway.", "There is a cost involved for businesses in hedging against fluctuations in the krone.", "A krone that is stable - but too strong - also entails costs to the economy in the form of low activity.", "Similarly, a krone that is stable - but weak - is a source of high inflation.", "Petroleum revenues generally provide substantial, but uneven currency inflows into Norway.", "The currency flows might have led to a strong and volatile krone.", "This tendency is countered when the annual use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget is predictable and independent of annual revenue flows, and the remainder is invested abroad.", "The capital outflow through the Petroleum Fund contributes to both curbing the appreciation of the krone and maintaining its stability.", "Norges Bank has not defined an exchange rate target.", "Nevertheless, developments in the krone are of considerable importance to interest-rate setting

enterprises and indirectly leads to higher output, employment and inflation.", "Themes in foreign exchange markets shift.", "In periods, investor focus on stock returns feeds through to exchange rate movements.", "During periods of political and economic unrest, investors may choose individual currencies as a safe haven - often the Swiss franc.", "In autumn 2002, the Norwegian krone was probably also perceived as a safe haven.", "In addition, oil prices rose as a result of the uncertainty associated with the war in Iraq.", "In autumn 2003, the krone showed a tendency to appreciate against the euro.", "This partly reflected lowered market expectations concerning an interest rate increase abroad and expectations that interest rates might rise earlier in Norway than in other countries.", "At the same time, the euro appreciated in relation to other currencies.", "Changes in the krone resulted in an unintended tightening of monetary policy.", "This trend was reversed in December owing to low inflation figures and a reduction in interest rates.", "The interest rate reduction was probably of considerable importance as it eliminated the excess return on NOK investments.", "The krone has appreciated again in the last couple of months.", "The appreciation of the krone, if it persists, may curb inflation one to two years ahead.", "Past experience shows that the krone is at times heavily influenced by developments in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries.", "This is given weight in interest-rate setting.", "However, as mentioned, themes in foreign exchange markets shift, and Norges Bank does not have instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate.", "Normally, Norges Bank will not intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to influence the exchange rate.", "Exchange market intervention, irrespective of whether foreign exchange is bought or sold, is not an appropriate instrument for influencing the krone over a longer period.", "We do not wish to act in a way that may trigger a game situation in the foreign exchange market.", "Foreign exchange intervention rather than a change in the interest rate may give ambiguous signals to foreign exchange operators and a game situation may arise.", "However, interventions may be appropriate if the krone deviates substantially from the level that the Bank judges to be reasonable in relation to fundamentals, and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target.", "Interventions may also be appropriate in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level.", "Although the krone may fluctuate in the short term, when inflation is low and stable, it will generally stabilise over time.", "When inflation has been higher in Norway than among our trading partners for a longer period, the krone has generally depreciated.", "When inflation in Norway is expected to be broadly in line with that of other countries, the exchange rate will normally also return to its normal range following periods when the krone has been particularly strong or particularly weak.", "Exchange rate expectations cannot be directly observed, but information from Consensus Forecast, a survey conducted among economists, may be an indicator.", "The chart shows the actual trade-weighted exchange rate (TWI) and expected TWI one year ahead as from 1998.3 When the krone is \"weak\", the expected exchange rate one year ahead tends to be stronger than the actual rate.", "Likewise, the expected exchange rate one year ahead tends to be weaker than the actual exchange rate when the krone is strong.", "In the period 2002-2003, the krone exchange rate varied considerably.", "Movements in exchange rate expectations, however, were less volatile.", "When the krone was at its strongest in the second half of 2002, the expected exchange rate one year ahead was 4-5 per cent weaker.", "This illustrates that exchange rate expectations seem to be more stable than actual exchange rate movements and that after moving markedly beyond a long-term equilibrium level, the krone exchange rate is expected to revert to around this level.", "The equilibrium level for the nominal exchange rate is not, however, constant over time, but partly depends on price and cost developments in Norway relative to our trading partners.", "The advantage of a flexible exchange rate is perhaps most evident when the economy is sluggish.", "If the krone were to remain at a level that is too strong, nominal wages would have to remain unchanged over a longer period or fall in order to bolster companies and jobs.", "This only occurs when unemployment is very high.", "With a flexible exchange rate, a depreciation of the krone can also boost competitiveness.", "A flexible exchange rate can reduce fluctuations in employment and output.", "Empirical studies4 have also suggested that economic growth in industrialised countries with floating exchange rates has been as strong, and often stronger than in countries with a stable exchange rate.", "A precondition is that there is an economic policy framework so that inflation does not spin out of control.", "The real exchange rate The chart shows developments in two measures of the real krone exchange rate, i.e.", "consumer prices and relative labour costs in Norway relative to trading partners, measured in a common currency.", "The real exchange rate measured by relative wage costs in a common currency is an expression of the cost competitiveness of Norwegian companies.", "The real krone exchange rate as measured in terms of developments in relative prices is an expression of the Norwegian krone's purchasing power.", "When the curves in the chart are above zero, the exchange rate is stronger and competitiveness weaker than the average level since 1970.", "The real exchange rate has fluctuated considerably over time and has deviated substantially from the average level over longer periods.", "Nevertheless, there has been a tendency for the real exchange rate to revert to this level.", "The points on the chart marked 2004 show the real exchange rate with wage and inflation projections for 2004 from Inflation Report 1/04.", "In relative prices, the real exchange rate is now about 3.5 per cent weaker than the average since 1970, whereas it is approximately 2.5 per cent stronger than its historical average measured in terms of relative labour costs.", "The exchange rate in the long term There has been divergence between cyclical developments in Norway and other countries.", "This was most pronounced in the 1980s when we had a strong upturn while Europe was in a recession.", "Although the economic cycles have been somewhat more similar over the years, there is still a time divergence.", "While the global turnaround took place in 2000, with a subsequent reduction in interest rates abroad, the Norwegian economy continued to show a high level of activity.", "Towards the end of the upturn, the economy was facing labour shortages, accelerating wage growth and a sharp increase in household consumption and debt.", "Interest rates in Norway remained high and the interest rate differential gradually widened.", "There have also been other differences between cyclical developments in Norway and other countries.", "The expansionary period in Norway led to strong wage growth from 1998 to 2002.", "The upturn in the global economy at the end of the 1990s was largely driven by business investment and wage growth was moderate.", "Wage growth in the Norwegian business sector from 1998 to 2002 was higher than the level that over time is consistent with the inflation target and with normal productivity growth.", "In 2003, wage growth was considerably lower than in the previous five years.", "This provided a sounder basis for substantial reductions in Norwegian interest rates, resulting in a narrowing of the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries.", "The reduction has contributed to a weakening of the krone since December 2002.", "Thus, the real exchange rate has also weakened and business sector competitiveness has improved.", "However, the business sector is still feeling the effects of the loss in competitiveness that resulted from high wage increases.", "The internationally exposed sector has been scaled back.", "Those companies that are still operating may be in a better position to bear the high wage level.", "Nevertheless, costs may hamper activity and employment growth.", "For a long time, a stable exchange rate and the level of cost inflation among our trading partners provided an anchor for wage determination in Norway.", "To maintain competitive strength, wage growth in Norway had to be on a par with wage growth among our trading partners when productivity growth in Norway was on a par with our trading partners.", "With the current monetary policy regime, the inflation target is the nominal anchor.", "According to updated national accounts figures, an inflation target of 21\u20442 per cent and trend productivity growth of around 2 per cent imply annual nominal wage growth of about 41\u20442 per cent.", "Wage growth that is lower than 4.5 per cent contributes to increased employment.", "The Swedish Trade Union Confederation's recommendations to its members are based on the inflation target: \"It is therefore in the interests of all wage earners to control total wage increases to avoid exceeding the level that is consistent with the inflation target defined by Sveriges Riksdag (Swedish parliament).\"", "Challenges facing the Norwegian business sector History has taught us that individual companies and individual industries in wealthy countries may be threatened by the emergence of producers from low-cost countries.", "Nevertheless, the emerging Asian economies have not posed a threat to industrialised countries' economies as a whole.", "On the contrary, growth in Asian economies has led to lower prices for a wider range of products.", "These countries have also gradually developed into important markets.", "We know from experience that competition from Japanese and then Korean shipyards was an important reason behind the downsizing of our own shipbuilding industry.", "Japan, however, has also become an important market for Norwegian fish, and Japanese tourists spend a considerable amount of money in Norway.", "The previous large trade deficit with Japan turned into a surplus in 2002, even excluding oil.", "The current strong growth rates in Asia are boosting demand for commodities.", "This also influences prices for commodities that we produce.", "Oil prices have risen sharply since 2000.", "Prices for other products such as paper and aluminium have shown a flatter trend, but have picked up.", "Salmon prices, which are more heavily influenced by developments in Europe, have risen sharply since spring 2003 following a marked fall in 2002.", "The impact of increased competition from low-cost countries on the Norwegian economy Imports from China to Norway increased considerably after 2001, reflecting in part China's membership of the WTO from December 2001.", "Imports from China will probably increase in the future.", "This in itself contributes to lower imported inflation.", "Moreover, inflation in Norway is restrained because the rise in prices for imports from trading partners other than China is also slowing.", "High economic growth in China may persist for a longer period, providing the possibility of a large market that will also be open to Norwegian firms.", "The enlargement of the EEA and the EU on 1 May this year will also open up new markets and sources of income for Norwegian firms, and increase the supply of labour.", "The transition to more open economies in Central and Eastern Europe has already had an impact on Norwegian firms.", "Trade with the Baltic countries, which used to be minimal, has increased sharply.", "Petroleum wealth and the krone exchange rate Let me conclude by referring to an analysis that can shed light on long-term developments in the real krone exchange rate.", "In the long term, the exchange rate tends to adjust so that there will be a balance both in the domestic economy and balance in the current account.", "Petroleum wealth, defined as the value of oil and gas under the seabed and the value of the Government Petroleum Fund, provides the basis for substantial foreign exchange revenues in the years ahead.", "These revenues will decline as the economy grows.", "The share of imports that can be financed by foreign exchange revenues from petroleum wealth will be reduced.", "Export earnings other than petroleum revenues will then be necessary.", "A substantial improvement in competitiveness will be required over time.", "Norway's history as an oil nation goes back to the end of the 1960s.", "Rough estimates suggest that a real exchange rate that ensures balance in the balance of payments when petroleum wealth no longer has the same significant role in the economy is more in line with the real exchange rate prevailing in Norway prior to the discovery of oil.", "This is shown in the chart, where the real exchange rate in 60 years' time, after a sharp appreciation while we phase in petroleum wealth into the economy, will have reverted to the level prevailing before petroleum extraction began.", "On the basis of these analyses, a strong real krone exchange rate and weak competitiveness apply to a period in which the petroleum industry is expanding and we are reaping the biggest economic benefits."], "classifications": ["none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none",
