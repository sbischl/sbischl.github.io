defensive posture.", "In many instances, the banking institutions do not have the financial information systems capable of measuring the true profitability of individual products and services.", "There needs to be an ability to monitor and identify the products and customer relationships that may make a questionable, or even negative, and those that contribute to earnings.", "As customers become increasingly aware of alternative solutions, institutions will understandably feel compelled to fill gaps in their offerings to maintain relationships.", "The critical success factor will be to ensure that this is done at a profitable pricing point - and that the addition of new products does not decrease the profit contribution of existing products and services.", "For these reasons, it

that to happen, banks have to look within their organisations for the answers.", "Before resources are allocated, before a marketing direction and strategy is established, before the organisation is restructured, the bank needs to decide what its strategic business will be within the context of its markets - exactly what type of financial service provider it will be.", "As part of the efforts to

and operations across institutions in the group, outsourcing of non-core activity and leveraging on cross- selling of the products and services within the group.", "Following the consolidation of the 54 domestic banking institutions into ten banking groups, there was significant rationalisation of the wide range of common functions and operations across institutions in the group.", "Six banking

licences, a commercial banking licence and a finance company licence.", "Under this arrangement, the domestic commercial banking institutions would in addition to its banking business, be able to

competitive pressures - have all combined to transform the structure of the banking industry.", "And with further development of new technology, the industry will likely continue to evolve.",

are able to harness on the capability of ICT in making strategic decisions - in terms of enabling better alignment of businesses, enhancing organisational capacity and capability such as in risk management, and building better customer relationships.", "Today, decisions on ICT investments demand a more thorough assessment, extending beyond the cost implications, to include better human resource redeployment, more efficient work flow process and system interface, expandability of the technology platform and the level of complexity to users and customers.", "As banking institutions continue to adopt greater sophistication in the application of ICT, efforts must also be intensified to develop ICT-savvy employees and to increase customers' understanding and acceptance of the new approaches.", "While the efficiency of electronic means of doing banking, such as electronic kiosks and internet banking is valued, the need for personal attention cannot be ignored.", "While being engrossed in the technology race this is a factor that should not be neglected.", "Banking business after all is about cultivating relationships, which will become more challenging as customers become more well informed and knowledgeable as they move up the income curve.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, In this period of rapid change, where change is the only constant, the successful organisations will be those that are able to recognise and identify the forces of change and how it affects them and make the required internal adjustments in response.", "This is by no means an easy task.", "Change mandates a need to create a new organisational mindset, capable of identifying opportunities and responding to them.", "Such organisations will be those comprising individuals with a clear sense of mission and empowerment and in which every level of the institution is motivated and focussed on achieving a consistent set of corporate objectives.", "In a service organisation, it will always be the type of talent that is hired and retained that will make the difference.", "This is perhaps the greatest challenge facing banks.", "The level of knowledge and expertise is vital to achieving excellence in providing the required services.", "Currently, the skills and expertise are insufficient compared to the global providers.", "In assessing how well a customer is served, quality is a key factor especially when dealing with service operations.", "The role of quality, and its inter-relationships with operational aspects of a service organisation has been expressed in what has been described as the \"service-profit chain\" as follows: (i) profit and growth are stimulated primarily by customer loyalty; (ii) loyalty is a direct result of customer satisfaction; (iii) satisfaction is largely influenced by the value of services provided to customers; (iv) value is created by satisfied, loyal and productive employees; (v) employee satisfaction results primarily from high-quality support services and policies that enable employees to deliver results to customers.", "Superior insights on customer needs will be an important advantage.", "This will involve recognising the diverse needs of the different customer segments.", "There is now already a discernable change in the pattern of customer behaviour.", "There is now an increasing shift towards a customer base that has less need for the standard distribution systems for most banking services.", "\"If you build it, they will come\" used to be the by-word for domestic banking institutions.", "A new branch would naturally attract new customers.", "Now, while customer relationship is of vital importance, these needs to be addressed in the context of the needs of the younger customers for retail services who do not want the \"inconvenience\" of a branch.", "The preference is for services as much as possible over the telephone, ATM or Internet.", "Writing cheques has become an inconvenience.", "This new generation of customers have their own ideas of what a bank should be and successful banks need to respond to this change.", "A further segment that will gain in importance is that of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) given its growing significance in the economy.", "The main concern with respect to banking for the SMEs is access to credit.", "Among the issues that have been raised is the quality of service delivered in terms of accessibility, the lack of responsiveness, lack of understanding of their business, poor branch level service, and poor turn around time.", "Other complaints have centered on the high collateral demands and the general perception of a lack of willingness to extend financing by the banking institutions.", "While the recent year showed an encouraging trend with loans to SMEs increasing by 3.1%, the issue of the overall services provided to SMEs need to be enhanced.", "Bank Negara Malaysia has undertaken a survey through the banking institutions on the SME profile and requirements.", "This will represent an important database for the development of a comprehensive framework for the development of SMEs initiated by Bank Negara.", "The survey findings will also be useful for the banking industry in formulating its own strategic plans with respect to this segment.", "With the advances in technology, banking institutions should be in a position to enhance access and quality of service for the SMEs.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, The performance of the banking institutions is also being gauged from the perspective of the shareholders.", "There are several significant issues affecting shareholders in the current environment.", "The global trend is being driven partly by an increased focus by banks on the financial performance and on the creation of shareholder value.", "In essence, the potential for growth lies in the value of their investments.", "This would be the right thing to do in the interest of long-term survival.", "There are enough examples of companies around the world that had lost track of the true reason for venturing into a particular business and as a result, they find themselves no longer in the business.", "Despite narrowing of interest margins and high costs, the banking industry has been able to increase their returns with the average return to shareholders in 2001 being 14.5%.", "Banks, like other companies in a free market economy, have a responsibility to generate returns for their shareholders.", "It is in the interests of the community as a whole that they do so, otherwise we could end up with a weak banking sector.", "But any company maximises shareholder value subject to constraints.", "These may be imposed by laws and regulations, or by the expectations of society.", "This means that if banks wish to preserve their reputation and the confidence of their customers, on which ultimately the strength of their franchise depends, they should act in a way that is seen to be fair and reasonable.", "To do otherwise, may in the long-term, be inconsistent with the objective of creating shareholder value.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me take a moment to say a few words on Islamic banking.", "Today, Islamic banking in Malaysia has firmed its position as a viable and vibrant component of the banking system.", "Bank Negara Malaysia has been in the forefront in providing the necessary and required infrastructure for the sector to grow further.", "From a market share of virtually nil a decade ago, Islamic banking has captured more than 8% of the assets of the banking system and is poised to reach 20% by 2010.", "We capitalized on the dual banking system which we believed is the right approach, and we will continue to embark in this direction.", "There are currently two Islamic banks and 33 conventional banks with Islamic windows offering the full range of Islamic financial services, and the industry has recorded commendable growth at an annual rate of 48% in terms of assets.", "At the end of March 2002, the assets mobilised by the Islamic banking sector amounted to RM 59 billion.", "Deposits and financing mobilized during the same period amounted to RM 48 billion and RM 30.1 billion respectively.", "Islamic banking in Malaysia is now at the threshold of entering its next stage of development, to expand on a global basis, to gain greater acceptance as an effective and efficient means of intermediation and to contribute to the overall wealth creation.", "Policies and measures will be formulated to not only increase the capacity and the capability of the Islamic banking players but also to set the stage for Malaysia to be an active player in global developments in Islamic banking and finance.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, New players, new technologies, the push to globalisation and continuing deregulation are still driving change in the financial services industry.", "Productivity, service quality, customer satisfaction and cost are key factors that drive the performance in a financial services organisation.", "In this uncertain world, the drive towards excellence can only be realised if strategic steps are taken today to enhance capability and capacity, thereby securing the well being of the banking industry and thereby the ability of the industry to contribute to the overall economic prosperity of our nation.", "On this note, Ladies and Gentlemen, I
