The fiscal consolidation, which has reduced the impact of the public sector on the domestic financial markets; and The structural reforms programme, which, irrespective of the short-term costs, have started to yield initial results.", "Economic growth has contributed to the overall improvement of Albania's economic and financial balances.", "In line with our previous statements, the following is notable: Inflation edged up slightly, despite the containing effect of the sharp appreciation of the exchange rate, suggesting that the improvement of the cyclical position of the economy is beginning to be reflected in higher wages and other production costs;
