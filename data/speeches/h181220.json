their policy-related businesses, and transformed them into market competitors.", "However, due to deficiencies in financial standards and rules, imperfect corporate governance structure and inadequate capital, as well as the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, there was a massive build-up of non-performing loans in the banking sector.", "At that time, some scholars at home and abroad

process, they gradually established relatively well-regulated corporate governance structure and notably enhanced their internal management, risk control capability and market constraint mechanism, with their assets and profitability leaping into the front ranking of the world.", "Since 2011, BOC, ICBC, ABC and CCB were successivelyincluded in the list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).", "Past experience has demonstrated that it was through reforms that we could achieve a leap forward in the soundness of large financial institutions and that China's financial system was

improved.", "The reform of development-oriented and policy-backed financial institutions has been proceeding in an orderly manner.", "To tackle the problems of the indistinction between

Bank (CDB), Export-Import Bank of China (CEXIM) and Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC) in 1994.", "They grew over the decade but were, to varying degrees, troubled by problems like ambiguous boundaries of business and imperfect governance structure.", "According to the reform principles of targeted guidance and \"one policy for one bank\" specified on the National Financial Work
