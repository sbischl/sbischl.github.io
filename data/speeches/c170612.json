\"high-pressure economy\" argument -- which suggests that labor market conditions should be kept tight through monetary easing -- monetary policy may be tightened too late despite signs of inflation, potentially leading to intolerably high inflation.", "While I think that the \"high-pressure economy\" argument is probably correct, in actual monetary policy conduct, we should prioritize the 2 percent inflation target and regard further improvements in employment and increases in the growth rate as desirable to the extent that they can be achieved.", "Furthermore, the fiscal situation is also improving.", "Chart 4 shows the fiscal balance of the general government divided by nominal GDP.", "As can be seen in the chart, the government deficit relative to GDP deteriorated sharply to 8 percent in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008.", "It remained at that level for a while, but has improved by 6 percentage points since 2013 and now stands at about 2 percent relative to GDP.", "Part of the improvement of course is due to the consumption tax hike in 2014, but the tax hike accounts for only 8 trillion yen or 1.5 percentage points of GDP; the remaining 4.5 percentage points are due to the economic growth brought about by economic measures such as QQE.", "Moreover, the amount outstanding of government debt relative to nominal GDP, as shown in the chart, peaked in

results.", "What Are the Dangers of QQE?", "Given that QQE has clearly produced results, criticism of the Bank's monetary policy naturally has shifted to the argument that \"although nothing has happened so far, there is a danger that a serious problem may arise in the future.\"", "I call this kind of argument the \"big rock theory.\"", "As illustrated in Chart 5, the \"big rock theory\" holds that there is a big rock on the slope that blocks the way.", "However, if one tries to move the rock out of the way, it hardly moves at first, but once it does get rolling, it will not stop.",

better not to try to move the rock out of the way.", "happens for a while, but suddenly at some point it will give rise to hyperinflation, a surge in interest rates, and a collapse of the yen.", "For this reason, the theory argues, monetary easing should not be pursued.", "In my opinion, such fears are groundless.", "The criticism leveled by \"big rock theory\" proponents seems to have converged on the dangers associated with the exit from monetary easing.", "I think the reason is that hyperinflation and the collapse of the yen are unlikely to happen and the proponents of the \"big rock theory\" have realized that their warnings will not convince the public.", "\"Exit\" here refers to the Bank's termination of monetary easing followed by an increase in interest rates and a reduction of the monetary base because achieving 2 percent inflation is in sight as a result of monetary easing.", "Actually, if you think about it, the \"big rock theory,\" which focuses on dangers related to the exit, assumes that, as a result of monetary easing, a situation arises in which prices increase and monetary policy must be tightened.", "Therefore, the proponents of the theory do not hold the view that nothing will happen no matter how much monetary easing is pursued; rather, they recognize the effectiveness of QQE.", "From my perspective, this is a welcome argument, since it recognizes the effectiveness of monetary easing.", "At the exit, the Bank will have to raise interest rates.", "There are two possible ways to do so: by abandoning the negative interest rate policy currently carried out by the Bank and raising the interest rate applied to excess reserves; or by selling Japanese government bonds (JGBs) held by the Bank.", "While the Bank at the moment has not decided anything with regard to the exit, what I would like to explain is easier to understand by focusing on an increase in the interest rate applied to excess reserves, so let me do so here.", "According to proponents of the \"big rock theory,\" the Bank will make large losses when it raises the interest rate on excess reserves because of the low interest rates on JGBs purchased by the Bank in the past.", "It is of course possible that the Bank may register losses because it will receive low interest rates while paying high interest rates.", "Proponents of the \"big rock theory\" argue that if the Bank does indeed make losses, confidence in the currency would be undermined, there would be hyperinflation, the yen would collapse, and interest rates would surge.", "However, please think about it carefully.", "Essentially, does anyone use money paying attention to whether the central bank makes a profit or a loss?", "Moreover, the central bank, in return for purchasing government bonds in the market, supplies currency, that is, the monetary base.", "While yields even on JGBs at present are around 0 percent, they were 3 percent until around the middle of the 1990s.", "The reason is that back then the real economic growth rate was high and prices were rising somewhat.", "If prices rise, interest rates will also rise eventually.", "This means that it will be possible to purchase higher yielding JGBs.", "Of course, until that time, the Bank will have to hold low yielding JGBs while paying high yields to banks in order to prevent an overheating of the economy.", "However, in the end, the central bank will always make a profit in the long run, since it buys high yielding JGBs using cash and current account deposits that carry almost no costs.", "Thus, the Bank will not make a loss in the long run that could pose a danger.", "Another criticism that has been leveled against QQE is that it has a negative impact on banks' operations.", "Both real and nominal interest rates have declined as a result of the bold monetary easing measures.", "While low interest rates support the long-term economic recovery, some argue that they also undermine the operations of banks, which impedes the effects of monetary easing.", "Because banks' profits are based on the difference between deposit interest rates and the loan rates they charge and it is difficult for them to impose negative deposit interest rates, it is certainly the case that as loan interest rates approach zero, banks' profit margins necessarily decrease.", "However, the decline in interest rates is not only due to the Bank's policy measures.", "To start with, the decline in real interest rates is also due to a decline in the long-term growth potential of Japan's economy as well as structural changes in the supply of and demand for funds.", "This structural change in the supply of and demand for funds is due to the fact that firms have become excessive savers and do not borrow money.", "Meanwhile, the decline in nominal interest rates is due to the decline in prices.", "As prices rise, nominal interest rates will eventually also rise.", "Therefore, in order to raise interest rates, it is necessary to continue with bold monetary easing and achieve the 2 percent price stability target.", "Moreover, as the economy improves, the number of people unable to repay loans will decrease, the number of people who want to borrow money will increase, and banks will be able to raise lending rates again.", "Why Has the Price Stability Target Not Yet Been Achieved?", "As mentioned earlier, the monetary easing measures have been effective and warnings of the dangers of these measures make little sense.", "The only thing that the measures have not achieved is an increase in prices.", "Let me start by looking at developments in prices and then consider why the price stability target of 2 percent has not yet been achieved.", "Chart 6 shows the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) on a quarterly basis.", "The chart may give the impression that achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is a long way off.", "However, in order to grasp the underlying trend in consumer prices, it is necessary to look at the rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, since the CPI excluding fresh food but including energy is affected by temporary fluctuations in oil prices.", "The important thing to note when looking at these indexes is that their underlying trend was negative from the mid-1990s onward, but following the introduction of QQE the rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy turned positive and since then has continued to be on an uptrend.", "While the average annual rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy between April 1999, when it first turned negative, and April 2013 was minus 0.5 percent, it has been plus 0.6 percent between the start of QQE in April 2013 and April 2017 (excluding the 2 percent increase in the CPI as a result of the consumption tax hike).", "Next, let us have a more detailed look at developments in prices.", "Immediately after the introduction of QQE in April 2013, the rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy increased from around minus 0.5 percent to around plus 1 percent.", "After losing momentum in the wake of the consumption tax hike in April 2014, the rate of change turned upward again with the expansion of QQE, but then started to decline once again in 2016.", "However, as I will explain later, I believe that the rate of change will likely turn upward once more due to the expected decline in the unemployment rate and other factors.", "Certainly, the 2 percent price stability target has not yet been achieved.", "Moreover, many argue that even though the economy is said to have improved, increases in incomes are minimal, and thus they do not feel much improvement.", "The Bank of course also does not want prices to rise just for the sake of it but because the economy is improving.", "That is, the Bank conducts monetary policy based on the premise that deflation is detrimental because it leads to economic stagnation and that if we escape from deflation and achieve the 2 percent price stability target, the economy will also improve.", "So, why has the economy not recovered that much?", "Let me consider why the 2 percent price stability target has not been achieved.", "Analyses by the Bank suggest that a major reason for this is the decline in inflation expectations, and that the following two factors have played a major role in the decline in inflation expectations.", "First, (1) the decline in crude oil prices, (2) the weakness in demand following the consumption tax hike in April 2014, and (3) the slowdown in emerging economies and volatile global financial markets, have lowered the observed inflation rate.", "And second, amid this decline in the observed inflation rate, inflation expectations -- after having been largely flat -- weakened, reflecting the fact that expectations formation in Japan is largely adaptive, that is, backward-looking.", "Among these factors, let me focus on the consumption tax hike and the sluggishness in the global economy.", "Chart 7 shows developments in real consumption before and after the consumption tax hike.", "The chart indicates that following the consumption tax hike, consumption, as measured by the consumption activity index compiled by the Bank, has remained weak for more than two years, although it is now finally showing signs of recovery.", "The consumption tax hike from 5 percent to 8 percent had the effect of raising consumer prices by 2 percent.", "Thus, if we exclude the increase in consumption due to frontloading and the subsequent decline in response, real consumption should have fallen by 2 percent and then continued along the trend observed before the tax hike.", "While the chart depicts such a trend, actual growth in consumption has declined considerably and has fallen drastically below this trend particularly since the end of 2015.", "Moreover, although wages have not grown very much, if we exclude the effects of the consumption tax hike, real employee income -- i.e., wages multiplied by the number of employees -- has consistently grown, since employment has been consistently improving during this period.", "Thus, even though real income is increasing, the situation continues that consumption is not increasing.", "Chart 7 Stagnation in Real Consumption Introduction of Consumption tax hike April 2013 Trend after the introduction of QQE Trend after a downward shift of 2 percent Trend after a downward shift of 3.5 percent 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Consumption activity index World trade volume Real employee income Note: Real employee income is obtained by multiplying nominal wages by the number of employees (Labour Force Survey) and adjusting inflation by the CPI for all items.", "Sources: Bank of Japan; Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.", "Why is consumption not increasing?", "One potential explanation is that, given that there had been plans to further raise the consumption tax to 10 percent after the hike to 8 percent, people already responded in their consumption behavior as though the tax rate was raised by 5 percentage points to 10 percent.", "In that case, it would be no surprise that real consumption expenditure declined by 3.5 percent.", "However, even if we draw the trend based on this assumption, consumption has fallen further behind the trend since the end of 2015.", "Moreover, if the explanation that people already responded to an expected 10 percent consumption tax hike is correct, the next consumption tax hike to 10 percent should have little effect on consumption, which I find hard to believe.", "In any case, if real consumption decreases, demand will decline and prices will be subject to downward pressure.", "While it is difficult to know exactly how large this downward pressure is, it is certain that such pressure will exist.", "Another factor that should be mentioned is trends in the global economy.", "As shown in Chart 7, it is clear that the stagnation in global trade since 2015 has cooled consumer sentiment through a decline in exports and stock prices, and has delayed the recovery of Japan's economy.", "However, the tightening of the labor market seen in the decline in the unemployment rate shown in Chart 3 should lead to a rise in wages and eventually in prices.", "There are already signs of this happening.", "In this context, it is useful to look at the Phillips curve, which shows the link between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.", "Chart 8 shows the Phillips curve for Japan.", "In the chart, the inflation rate is shown on the vertical axis, the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis, and the Phillips curve is given by the downward-sloping curve.", "As can be seen, prices only rise gradually as the unemployment rate falls, but once the unemployment rate approaches 2 percent, prices rise quickly.", "The unemployment rate has already fallen to 2.8 percent.", "Therefore, there is no doubt that prices will eventually rise as the unemployment rate continues to fall.", "Chart 8 Phillips Curve and Tightening of the Labor Market y/y % chg. Price Price stability stability target target of of 2 2 percent percent food -2 1 2 3 4 5 6 Unemployment rate Source: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.", "Concluding Remarks As stated so far, the Bank's monetary policy measures have produced excellent results so far and with regard to prices, at least a situation in which there is no longer deflation has been achieved.", "Finally, I would like to say that the argument that economic growth is inhibited by a shortage of labor is incorrect.", "The argument essentially states that what impedes economic growth is the shortage of labor brought about by monetary easing measures.", "The argument therefore implies that monetary easing should not be carried out.", "However, because monetary easing measures have increased employment, they have boosted economic growth.", "Moreover, as a result of the shortage of labor, wages will rise.", "It is highly productive firms that can pay high wages, while firms with low productivity can only pay low wages.", "Therefore, if wages increase, highly productive firms will survive, and labor productivity in the economy overall will increase as well.", "In other words, rising wages due to a shortage of labor will promote productivity growth.", "On the other hand, some argue that low interest rates impede the economic metabolism.", "They argue that, as a result of the decline in interest rates, firms' interest burden decreases, firms that should exit the market do not do so, and the productivity of the economy as a whole declines.", "However, what happens if firms exit and unemployment surges?", "Productivity per person employed may increase, but output overall will decrease.", "Although it might be an exaggeration to say that this would result in a surge in unemployment and social instability, it would inevitably lead to problems.", "On the other hand, firm turnover caused by labor shortages does not cause such problems.", "I think that there is no one now who would answer yes when asked \"Are you a deflationist, thinking that it is better for prices to fall?\"", "In that sense, we are all reflationists now, hoping that prices will rise and the economy will improve.", "That is why the Bank continues to pursue its monetary easing policy.", "Thank you for your attention.", "For example, Shirakawa stated that \"we may have to take into account the risk that a continuation of low interest rates will affect the productivity of the overall economy and lower the potential growth rate endogenously.\"", "See Shirakawa Masaaki, \"Central Banking:
