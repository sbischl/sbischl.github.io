Talwar Committee (1975) and the Goiporia Committee (1990).", "The Report of the first Narasimham Committee (1991) ushered in the financial sector reforms, which were expected to spur competition in the banking sector through deregulation and entry of new private sector banks, which, in turn, was to ensure high quality customer service to meet the long pending aspirations of the bank customers.", "There is an increasing realisation, that competitive forces alone, the invisible hand of the market do not ensure fair treatment or adequate quality in service to the customers at a justifiable price, in a transparent manner.", "Regulatory intervention and oversight are necessary.", "In his seminal and oft quoted report, Dr. Rajan stated \"Consumer Protection is important.", "Not every household is fully cognizant of the transactions they enter into.", "While the line between excessive paternalism and appropriate individual responsibility is always hard to draw in a developing country like ours, it may well veer to a little more paternalism in interactions between financial firms and less sophisticated households.", "It is important to improve Consumer literacy, the transparency of products that are sold and in certain cases limit sales of certain products in certain jurisdictions especially if these have prudential consequences.\"", "Reserve Bank of India as the

card, Aadhaar letter issued by UIDAI and Job Card issued by NREGA signed by a State Government official are also accepted as proof of identity/address.", "These are known as officially valid documents

genuine reasons, she/he may submit the same to the bank within a period of six months from the date of opening account.", "(ii) Third party verification of KYC is allowed, which allows banks/FIs to rely on KYC/CDD carried out by other banks/FIs.", "Once the proposed Central KYC Registry is in place, customers would be saved from the trouble of submitting the KYC documents to each and every bank/FI whenever she/he opens an account with a different bank/FI.", "(iii) KYC verification of all the members of SHG is not required while opening the savings bank account of the SHG and KYC

selling of products and services, and tie-up arrangements are inconsistent with the concept of a trust-based relationship.", "The lack of transparency, coupled with the difficulty of consumers in identifying key information from the large volume of material and communication in fine print, leads to an information asymmetry, which renders the banker-customer relationship one of unequals.\"",
