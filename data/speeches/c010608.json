Strength and security; and Management with an executive board.", "Concentrating on core activities A good performance presupposes that we concentrate our resources to what is really important.", "The starting-point here is, of course, our main statutory functions, namely to maintain price stability and promote a safe and efficient payment system.", "For three hundred years the Riksbank has owned a paper mill and a note-printing works in Tumba and a mint in Eskilstuna.", "These are largely manufacturing operations.", "Through the Tumba works, in the past decade the Riksbank has been active in

possible to include more people in a realistic discussion of monetary policy, for example.", "We are now open to criticism of a sharper and more specific nature and that has been good for us.", "The Riksbank's motto, Hinc robur et securitas (Hence strength and security), which used to allude to our earlier functions as the producer of notes and coins, for example, now refers at least as much to our analytical competence, the accuracy of our analyses and our efficiency as an authority.", "Management with an executive board One consequence of the new Riksbank Act, effective from the beginning of 1999, was that a new Executive Board, consisting of six members, is collectively responsible for all the Bank's operations.", "This was a clear break with the earlier arrangement where the management was closer to that of a conventional company with a managing director and a board that exercised control and took the overriding decisions.", "I should like to conclude with some remarks on the challenges this change involved.", "As regards monetary policy, it was not all that difficult.", "In the light of experience from the German, British and American central banks, for example, we had drawn up proposals for working procedures which we have largely adhered to.", "Our internal process is very open and the staff are deeply involved.", "The minutes of the Executive Board's monetary policy discussions are published, which dispels any sense of mystery.", "At the same time, a better foundation is hopefully provided for a discussion of monetary policy in society in general.", "The matter of internal control has been trickier.", "One alternative would be to treat the Executive Board as a board of directors; that, however, would have meant working with as many as 18 chief executives in the form of the heads of department.", "Another possibility would be to see ourselves as chief executives but that, too, has its pros and cons; few organisations have six chief executives, presumably for very good reasons.", "Perhaps the closest parallel is the board of a group with a number of subsidiaries.", "In practice we have adopted a variety of approaches.", "We have tried to delegate more matters more specifically to the heads of department, leaving them to run the operations and provide continuity and competence.", "At the same time, the number of departments has been reduced so as to have an organisation that is less top-heavy.", "The Executive Board's responsibilities have been shared out among the members.", "That does not mean that we are to manage day-to-day operations, which is a matter for the department heads.", "Our task is to act instead as a source of support and dialogue.", "The internal management and the way we handle monetary policy are interconnected.", "An arrangement with reservations and so on could lead to a polarised picture in the media and that in turn could have repercussions on the internal work.", "Even though we do not see any differences of opinion as something unnatural, others may do so and that might make it difficult to avoid splits in the organisation.", "In this respect I think we have been broadly successful.", "At times the media have presented a dramatic scene with major differences of opinion but with the passage of time we seem to have become less and less newsworthy.", "At the same time, we have handled the system rather carefully and abstained from arguing with each other.", "That I thing is wise because the system is rather fragile.", "Let me conclude by referring back to my opening remarks.", "The financial markets are becoming increasingly integrated, banks are crossing more and more boundaries and so on.", "All this is affecting the Riksbank to a high degree.", "The same is true of the rapid technical innovations, with increasingly complex payment systems.", "Add to this the possibility of EMU and you can see the future does not lack challenges.", "Apropos of what I have been talking about today, a while ago one of my American colleagues, Bill McDonough, said something to this effect: we should be pleased if we are better today than we were yesterday at the same time as we are not yet as capable as we will be tomorrow.", "I think that's about right."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
