cent in the EU as a whole and 2.9 per cent in Germany.", "These figures are very familiar and have been widely discussed; equally well known is the fact that the gap depends not so much on public spending as on business spending, which is undercut by Italian firms' systematically smaller size than their competitors in the other advanced countries.", "This feature of the Italian economy means that R&D investment is highly concentrated.", "In 2013 the three biggest spenders accounted for 56 per cent of total private R&D expenditure, compared with 39 per cent in Germany.", "And although the per capita number of Italian patents deposited with the European patent office has been rising steadily since the mid1990s, it is still relatively low.", "Here again, firm size is crucial.", "The

manufactures, appear to count much; even if we could \"impose\" Germany's sectoral composition on the Italian economy, the innovation gap would be narrowed only marginally.", "Smallness is coupled with an ownership structure and management practices that are often loath to take on the risks of innovation.", "Meanwhile, the market in venture capital - which specializes in financing the rapid growth of innovative start-ups - is still poorly developed in Italy.", "Above all, what is decisive is the quality of the work force.", "Knowledge and the \"knowledge factory\" Self-evidently, better educated working people have a greater capability for innovation and adapt better to organizational changes.", "The correlation between the share of universitytrained staff in a firm and its capacity

intermediate.", "Many of the workers engaged in the latter have been forced to accept lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs, causing earnings to become polarized.", "The pervasive impact on all work-related activities of mobile connection to the Internet, which is at once an enormous pool of knowledge and a concentrate of the entire world's calculating capacity, requires new skills, such as the ability to gather, select and rapidly analyse data drawn from the web.", "Since this pool is also seriously polluted, the ability to instantly distinguish correct information from erroneous information presented as if it were correct is essential.", "Calculation capacity must be used sparingly and appropriately.", "This requires a powerful endowment of skills that need constantly updating to keep pace with often unpredictable changes.", "To develop a country's human capital it is no longer enough to furnish a large number of students with a baggage of notions to be applied in routine fashion over the course of their working life.", "What educators call \"competence\" is indispensable, namely the ability to mobilize personal resources - knowledge, know-how, aptitudes - and outside informational resources to respond effectively to new situations.", "The importance of competence is not new.", "The economic historian Joel Mokyr holds that a key factor in the British industrial revolution of the eighteenth century was precisely the abundance of high-quality professional and craft skills: Effective use of knowledge, however, required not only access and incentives to create and access new technology, but also the competence to make use of it and to carry out the \"instructions\" contained in the blueprint of the technique.", "Much of the knowledge employed by artisans and engineers was \"tacit\", that is, not formally written down in the \"recipe\" used for production, but little tricks and know-how based on experience or imitation.", "On this terrain Italy is not necessarily at a disadvantage.", "If you talk about the problems and prospects of our economy with entrepreneurs and managers, they regularly bring up one distinctive characteristic of Italy's successful companies, large and small alike: the ability to adapt their products to the diverse needs of customers, moving away from standard models.", "That is, Italian \"flexibility\" is often seen as the proper response to German \"reliability\".", "The bedrock of artisanal skills and professional competence upon which the fortune of a good part of Italian industry was built naturally favours a mind-set emphasizing competences over one tending to the mechanical application of preconceived ideas.", "Here Italy does not seem to suffer from any handicap.", "So why haven't we managed to make greater use of this innate predisposition of Italian entrepreneurs and workers?", "The fact is that an abundance of skills is not enough.", "As Mokyr observes with respect to Britain, the right combination of artisanal skills and scientific knowledge is more highly A purely artisanal-knowledge society will eventually revert to a technological equilibrium, in contrast to a society where the world of artisans is constantly shocked by infusions of new knowledge from outsiders.", "High-level scientific knowledge is essential to be at the frontier of basic and applied research; but a constructive interchange between artisans and scientists must also be developed.", "That is the story of the telescope.", "It has been told by Ludovico Geymonat as follows: We know that lens-shaped glasses had long been familiar to optical craftsmen and used by them to correct sight defects, but until Galileo all the representatives of high science had always looked down on them with contempt.", "Galileo had the courage and the intelligence to make use of these lenses for his astronomical research, artfully combining them to achieve a power of magnification that was truly exceptional for the time.", "The place where scientific knowledge and the set of competences of the most highly skilled workers are \"produced\" is the university20 Italy differs from the most advanced countries by the much smaller amount of resources allocated to universities by families and by the public sector:21 annual spending per student is less than 20 per cent of per capita GDP, compared with a European average of nearly 30 per cent.", "Despite the institution of the three-year university degree course, we still lack a clear distinction between \"light\" higher education - suitable for the blue and white collar tasks that are at the base of the production apparatus - and education designed to supply the economy with a steady flow of specialists and professionals who, in today's globalized world, can keep up with their peers from INSEAD, MIT or London Business School.", "A vicious circle of supply and demand has set in.", "The Italian universities do not supply adequate human capital for a modern, advanced economy, while the firms that should demand it are often not equipped to recognize different degrees of quality and put the right price on them, often because they are too small.", "Salary levels, even in individual contracts, almost never distinguish between graduates from a low-ranking Italian university and a Harvard Ph.D. Judging by the standards of American, British and German graduate schools or the French grandes e\u0301coles, it is almost as if Italy had given up the idea of training its professional elite at home and delegated the task to universities abroad.", "The average American university student invests nearly $15,000 a year (at 2011 prices) in post-secondary education.", "In Italy, converting euros into dollars at purchasing power parity, the average student gets an investment of $6,500, $2,200 from his or her family and $4,300 from the government.", "These numbers reflect a radical difference in fundamental social choices.", "In the US, investment in good education is central to the long-term spending decisions of families and also of the public sector.", "Anyone with even a slight familiarity with American lifestyles knows the sacrifices and the saving that so many families dedicate to this investment, going so far as to plan their children's college admission from birth.", "So it should come as no surprise that that society generates such a large part of the world's innovations in every field of knowledge and workaday practice.", "The other substantial difference between these two systems lies in the use that is made of public resources.", "In the United States the share allocated directly to families in the form of scholarships and student loans is much larger than in Italy; indeed, student loans, which provide especially strong incentives, are practically unknown here.", "This form of public spending leaves it to the student to determine the end beneficiary of the funds through the choice of university; it has the advantage of spurring the competition for students among universities.", "In countries where diplomas do not have a mandated legal value, the same regardless of individual or institution, as they do in Italy, universities will not compete by offering easy courses and high grades but by gaining the reputation for enabling their graduates to succeed in the job market, where a degree from a better institution is more valuable.", "Still tougher challenges lie ahead.", "As Brynjolfsson and McAfee observe, \"Computers [have] started diagnosing diseases, listening and speaking to us, and writing high-quality prose, while robots [have] started scurrying around warehouses and driving cars with minimal or no guidance\".", "Technical progress has always left entire occupations behind, soon to be replaced by others.", "This time around, the process may be extremely intensive, and governing it may prove complicated.", "In the United States, as in the main European countries, including Italy, one out of every two of today's jobs risks being automated out of existence within a decade or two.", "For workers with special skills or simply with the right education there has never been a better time than the present because they are in a position to use technology to generate value.", "By the same token, for workers with merely ordinary skills there has never been a worse time than now, because the replicants to replace them are advancing rapidly and there will be no \"blade runners\" to stop them.", "But what is the right education, what do you need to keep from being swept away by the digital revolution?", "Acemoglu and Autor contend that work can be classified by a simple twoby-two table: cognitive/manual, routine/non-routine.", "Labour demand for all routine jobs, including cognitive ones, appears to be on a secular downswing.", "And in our service-based, white-collar societies, cognitive but routine jobs are extremely numerous; they embrace a large part of the middle class, which is accordingly the most seriously threatened.", "Economists have always sought to determine which variables are decisive for long-term growth.", "Tangible capital accumulation was long considered the principal lever of development.", "The focus shifted next to technical progress26 and then, finally, to its determinants: namely, the capacity of firms, economies and societies to continue to \"learn\";27 dynamism and home-grown creativity, the thrill of an intellectual and entrepreneurial challenge.", "How can a country acquire these talents?", "If aided by history, it will find them embedded in its culture and traditions.", "Otherwise, purposeful political action is required to stimulate the creativity of inventors and entrepreneurs.", "To foster new entrepreneurs, to convince the existing ones to expand their businesses by separating them from their family fortunes, to reward daring and inventiveness, to discourage positional rents - this must be
