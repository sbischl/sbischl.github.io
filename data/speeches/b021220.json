Accord is scheduled for implementation in 2005.", "Reflecting comments on the second consultative package, the draft third consultative package is scheduled for release early next year.", "Judging from the comments submitted in May, the new draft promises to be interesting and controversial.", "This is not surprising since it will mark what will be no less than the beginning of a worldwide revolution in the way financial institutions are managed, and especially how risks are supervised.", "The sophistication that comes with enhanced risk-sensitive capital charge should be an important incentive to drive financial institutions around the world to upgrade their expertise, organizational structure, database, IT system, and most of all their risk management process.", "Speaking from Thailand's own experiences and limitations, we realize that both planned and unforeseen challenges will mark our path towards eventual compliance.", "As such, we have taken some initial steps to check the readiness of financial institutions to conform to the credit risk guidelines under the New Capital Accord.", "A full impact analysis will be conducted next year.", "Going some way to prepare for the more sophisticated methodology embodied in the New Capital Accord's treatment of credit and operational risk, we are requiring, as a first step in the same spirit, that financial institutions calculate market risk capital charge in 2002.", "Actual capital requirement will be made, tentatively, in 2003.", "Although the complexity of credit risk and internal rating approach will add new difficulties even after market risk is mastered, we believe this step will serve to focus the attention of top management of financial institutions and supervisors, ensuring they will stay alert to other complexities that follow.", "In this connection, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Roland Raskopf and Mr. Jason George, who last October were kind enough to give Thailand's

banks.", "I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Mr. George, who spent three years at the Bank of Thailand as consultant to help us build up our supervisory

week.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Our common goal is to devise a comprehensible and methodical road map through a steep learning curve, in order to build up risk management expertise.", "This will place us on a sound footing, necessary for meeting the challenges of credit risk models in the Internal Ratings Based, or IRB, approach.", "Therefore expertise and database concerns remain formidable tasks toward IRB compliance.", "Although there is no need for me to say this, given the credentials of this audience, the New Capital Accord is quite daunting for regulators.", "But fortunately, or rather unfortunately, depending on how one looks at it, globalization and technological development mean that none of us are alone in this journey.", "This seminar is an important testimonial to the case in point.", "It is with great hope and expectation that through cooperation, pitfalls will be avoided, and success only a few policy measures, studies, committees, and sub-committees away.", "This reflects the new emphasis on supervisory coordination.", "Once the system is up and running, supervisory coordination in terms of exchange of information, say on risk model validation, will also be

technological development, that is, E-Banking.", "Indeed the key driver of the financial landscape in the past decade has been technology.", "Innovations, both in finance and IT, have changed the

significant amount of resources modifying their technology systems to support new on-line services and to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their operations.", "A new dimension of competition has also emerged in the form of non-bank providers, begging the question of valid regulatory framework and forcing us to rethink our definition of financial institution and role of central
