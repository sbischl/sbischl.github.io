are to achieve education for the majority of our people, we need concerted efforts from all stakeholders including private institutions and charitable organisations like the Masomo Education Foundation.", "Mr President, I am informed that the objective of the Foundation is to educate young Zambians at local colleges.", "I am particularly pleased that the Foundation is utilizing local

have no doubt that supporting our local institutions will lead to a stronger motivation and morale in our teachers.", "To this end, my Institution, the Bank of Zambia, currently provides scholarships to the University of Zambia and the Copperbelt University.", "Additionally, we also provide salary supplements to relevant departments as a way of encouraging our Zambian academics who are working under very difficult and challenging situations.", "Furthermore, I am reliably told, that the Masomo Scholarship is conferred only on the best and intelligent young men and women.", "The stringent

several applications from a wide section of candidates.", "It is gratifying to know that many young men and women wish to have an opportunity to better their education in these trying times.", "It is

deserved achievement, let me remind you that as you accept this scholarship, you have an obligation and duty to the Masomo Foundation and to the nation at large.", "It is this strong sense of obligation, duty, and commitments to serve the nation that enabled our fathers and fore fathers serve the Nation wholeheartedly and brought us where we are today.", "As students with a Masomo Scholarship, each of you will be given a unique opportunity to prove yourself.", "I urge you to work hard and learn from others around you including those different from you and less endowed than you.", "Let me also mention that as a Masomo Scholar, your progress and performance will be closely monitored and you will be looked upon as role models.", "I urge you to set the standards for others
