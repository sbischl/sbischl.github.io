and Risk Sharing: The Role of the Monetary Union\" 4.1 General remarks Seblem Kalemli-Ozcan et al.", ": Financial integration and risk sharing Financial integration in EMU has been driven by the introduction of the single currency and by legislative and regulary policies striving for harmonisation \u21d2The impact of these factors is difficult to disentangle \u21d2The authors tackle the banking sector, but other financial market segments are worth examining as well Financial integration in the form of cross-border banking integration increases consumption risk-sharing \u21d2May be worthwhile to make a distinction between intra and extra-euro-area risk sharing Part I of their interesting and topical paper gives an overview of financial integration in EMU and describes the main legislative and regulatory policies that EU member states have implemented in financial markets.", "Part II provides empirical evidence for the impact of the single currency and European harmonisation policies on financial integration.", "Furthermore, it analyses the implications for consumption risk sharing in the euro area.", "The main findings are that the single currency and the harmonisation policies of EU have both fostered financial integration and that cross-border banking integration increases consumption risk sharing.", ".2 EMU and cross-border banking integration An important contribution made by Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan et al.", "is that they try to disentangle the impact of the single currency and harmonisation policies on financial integration.", "This distinction is of major relevance with respect to the further process of integration.", "The authors' focus on banking integration is appropriate with regard to the subsequent analysis of consumption risk sharing, where bank lending is deemed to be a prominent transmission channel.", "However, it should be kept in mind that there are more financial market segments of interest and that the euro and harmonisation policies might affect them to a different degree.", "As I have already noted, there is strong evidence that monetary union has fostered integration of markets for equity and long-term debt securities.", ".3 Banking integration and risk sharing As for the authors' concept of consumption risk sharing, let me make two remarks.", "First, consumption smoothing is measured relative to a panel of 20 European and non-European countries.", "This reflects the fact that the paper concentrates on differences in consumption growth across countries and, therefore, analyses international consumption smoothing.", "Domestic smoothing is thereby ignored.", "Furthermore, the estimates do not make a distinction between whether consumption smoothing of EMU countries takes place within the euro area or vis-a\u0300-vis the rest of the world.", "It is true that, from a welfare point of view, a distinction between intra and extra-euro-area risk sharing does not make sense.", "However, the authors' conclude that \"the increased cross-banking integration due to the euro has improved ex-post the optimality of the currency union by improving risk sharing\".", "This implies that risk sharing of euro area countries takes place mainly among each other.", "My second comment concerns the way the authors measure consumption smoothing.", "The paper regresses international differences in consumption growth on international differences in GDP growth, multiplied by a term including banking integration.", "A perfect consumption smoothing would imply that asymmetric GDP shocks do not transmit into diverging consumption paths at all.", "Following Asdrubali, S\u00f8rensen and Yosha (1996) and the modification of Me\u0301litz (2004), it might be helpful not to stop here but to have a further look at the individual components of GDP and the respective channels of risk sharing.", "Expressed in logarithms and first differences, GDP growth can be decomposed into4 (growth of private consumption) (consumpti on smoothing) lnln ln or, in more detail, ln GDP ln C (growth of private consumption) ln GDP ln GNP (smoothing by net foreign income) ln GNP ln A (smoothing by external saving) ln A ln C (smoothing by domestic saving) ln GNP ln A In this disaggregation, we would expect the term to be the main channel through which consumption smoothing by cross-border banking integration should work.", "In the following table, calculated for Germany, the coefficients and indicate the absorption of additional GDP growth by net foreign income and external saving, respectively.", "A positive sign stands for a positive effect on consumption smoothing.", "The coefficients suggest that international consumption risk sharing in Germany is primarily achieved by countercyclical net foreign income, whereas external saving tends to go along with business cycles.", "This outcome holds for both overall consumption smoothing and consumption smoothing vis-a\u0300-vis other euro-area countries only.", "International consumption smoothing Absorption of additional GDP growth by net foreign income and external saving Overall vis-a\u0300-vis EMU \u03b2E \u03b2H 0.01 -0.03 0.13 -0.23
