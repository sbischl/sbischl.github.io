and if yes, what will be the mechanism of such an adjustment and what will its consequences for the global growth be?", "Let us begin with a presentation of the main hypotheses that explain the phenomenon of global imbalances.", "In 2003, three economists presented a hypothesis that an informal Bretton Woods regime had been reactivated8.", "The original Bretton Woods system was created after WWII and consisted in a formal obligation of its participant countries to maintain foreign exchange rates, determined against a gold parity, on a specific level, with acceptable deviations not exceeding 1 percent.", "The system ceased to exist in 1971 after president Nixon had taken a decision that the USA would no longer exchange dollars for gold according to the parity determined.", "The nature of the reactivated Bretton Woods, often called Bretton Woods 2, is well conveyed in the motto used by the authors of this \"(...) if I made an agreement with my tailor that whatever money I pay them, it returns to me on the very same day as a loan, I would have no objection at all to ordering more suits from him\" (Jacques Rueff, 1965, after Dooley et al.", "(2003)) The hypothesis of the existence of an informal Breton Woods 2 says that a system has been established in which it is profitable for the Asian countries to finance the US current account deficit, because it allows them to increase their exports to this market.", "Thus, it supports the economic development of the Asian countries and allows them to create new jobs, which is particularly important in China, where - according to various estimates - each year between 10 and 20 million of jobs should be created, due to migration from rural areas to cities.", "In order to maintain the competitiveness of their exports, the Asian countries intervene on the FX market, thus preventing appreciation of their currencies.", "They invest the purchased dollars in American bonds, thus financing the US current account deficit.", "Another hypothesis that explains the mechanism of the occurrence of global imbalances has been formed by the present Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke9.", "His major concept is that the large US current account deficit cannot be explained solely by internal factors.", "In the opinion of the present Fed chairman, external factors, which he has defined as a global savings glut, have played the key role.", "The hypothesis says that a substantial surplus of savings over investments in the Asian countries, together with the structurally high savings in Germany and Japan, have resulted in a global savings glut that has caused a boom on the US stock exchanges and an increase in the property prices, which has in turn resulted in a drop in household savings in the USA.", "The Bretton Woods 2 and the global savings glut hypotheses are challenged by the IMF, which claims that the source of the current account surpluses is the excessively low level of investments in the Asian countries - except for China.", "Thus, according to the IMF, we deal with a global investment drought10, considering the fact that during the five years following the Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the level of investments was about 7 percentage points lower than during five years before the crisis.", "Therefore, an appropriate recommendation for these countries is not limiting their savings rate but enhancing their investment climate.", "According to other hypotheses, the major factor behind the global imbalances is the low level of savings in the US household and public sectors11, i.e.", "the fact that Americans spend more than they earn and that the budget deficit, from a substantial surplus in the year 2000, turned into a level estimated at 4.7% of the GDP in 2004.", "Another factor that is often indicated is the change in the economic policy of the Asian countries after the crisis of 1997-1998, when a decision was taken in many countries to establish huge foreign exchange reserves for the purpose of hedging against similar changes in the sentiment of financial markets in the future12.", "Other hypotheses indicate higher investment attractiveness of the USA in comparison to other regions, measured - inter alia - with the higher potential economic growth rate13.", "There exists another hypothesis, according to which such a high current account deficit is optimal14, in the face of the expected higher future growth rate of the American economy in comparison to that of other developed economies.", "This hypothesis is based on the assumption that Americans increase their present consumption financed from loans, anticipating high future earnings that will allow them to pay off the loans, which is perfectly correct.", "Finally, there are papers which try to prove that ... there is no deficit.", "The above-mentioned article by Hausmann and Sturzenegger15 arguing for the existence of \"dark matter\" is an example of this approach.", "In spite of many attempts to prove that the US current account deficit is in fact lower than it is believed to be and that it is even desirable, a vast majority of academic economists and many central bankers are seriously alarmed by the scale of global imbalances.", "Many papers have been written recently that show what may be the consequences of the scenario in which the financial markets - in view of no adequate measures undertaken by economic decision-makers - initiate adjustment processes by themselves16.", "If the financial markets start pricing in higher risk premium for American debt securities, the outflow of capital from this market - or even decreased capital inflows - may lead to a fall in bond prices, i.e.", "to a sharp increase in long-term interest rates, a slowdown on the property market, depreciation of the dollar and, consequently, stagnation or even recession, which may be observed globally.", "In order to mitigate the probability of such a scenario, structural reforms should be implemented in many countries.", "The USA should substantially reduce its budget deficit and - via a reform of the pension system - increase the household savings rate.", "In the EU and Japan a series of structural reforms should be accelerated to raise the flexibility and competitiveness of the labour and product markets .", "In the Asian countries, and first of all in China, the exchange rate regime needs to be made more flexible, which should be preceded by reforms that would strengthen the financial system, also via a greater openness to foreign capital inflows.", "At present, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of the scenario involving a serious slowdown in the global growth; nevertheless, implementation of necessary reforms is proceeding slowly.", "Before I move on to the other aspect of globalisation, let me repeat that I understand globalisation as a progressive process of international integration of national markets of goods, services, capital and knowledge.", "In practice, this means higher levels of trade and higher inflows of foreign investment, For example M.

as a result - in prices of these factors.", "Multinational corporations divide their production among many different countries in order to minimise costs and make use of advantages of local markets, such as inexpensive labour force or a favourable location.", "Research and development, on the other hand, and the part of the production process that requires the use of the most advanced technologies and with the highest value added, are often located in the home country, also due to poor protection of the proprietary rights in developing countries.", "Such a conduct allows the company to benefit from comparative advantages related to different production locations.", "Moreover, it enables the use of international differences in exchange rates, interest rates, and government subsidies supporting selected types of economic activity, as well as of different structures of customs tariff rates and varying features of internal markets in particular countries, for the purpose of maximising profits.", "Research22 indicates that differences in remuneration constitute a significant factor that leads to relocation of jobs in manufacturing to the countries in our region.", "Hence, the result of production fragmentation is the optimal use of the advantage of location of particular production stages and the reduction of the average cost.", "However, its side effect are additional costs related to linking of the particular stages into one via activities that have the nature of services (e.g.", "transportation, co-ordination and management).", "The phenomena inseparable from all those mentioned above are offshoring and outsourcing.", "Offshoring consists in relocation of jobs and production or orders from the country where the company is based abroad -
