(b) the attitudes, needs and other personal attributes of the followers; (c) characteristics of the organization or the movement, as the case may be, such as its purpose, its structure as also the nature of the tasks to be performed; and (d) the social, economic and political milieu.", "This basically signifies that though the leader may, indeed, be at the heart of the leadership discourse, it is, in the ultimate analysis, a complex relationship among the aforesaid variables.", "Since by definition each leader is unique, what he or she learns from the interplay of these variables and how he or she uses it to shape the future is unique to him or her too.", "Throughout our lives, each of us makes thousands of decisions or judgment calls.", "Some are trivial like what vegetables you will be buying.", "Some are monumental like whom to marry or what career to pursue.", "How many of these decisions that we make turn out to be good ones?", "More importantly, did we make good decisions on things that really mattered?", "Our ability to exercise good judgment determines the quality of our individual lives.", "And, as we rise to positions of leadership, the importance and consequences of our judgment calls are magnified exponentially by their increasing impact on the lives of others.", "The cumulative effect of leaders' judgment calls determines the success or failure of their organizations.", "For many organizations, investment in leadership and leadership development remains a leap of faith, informed through gut instinct and the current rhetoric on the value and significance of leadership in organizations.", "Few organizations articulate a clear \"theory of action\" that argues why and how particular leadership development and performance management activities will enhance leadership capacity, at individual, team and organizational levels, and, in turn, how this contributes towards organizational performance, however defined.", "Scholars have often suggested that the effectiveness of leadership development is determined more by \"how you do it\" rather than \"what you do\".", "Thus, when faced with a proliferation of leadership development tools and initiatives, the effective organization reflects on the purpose, principles and assumptions involved and how they relate to current and future organizational needs and performance - opting for an integrated and holistic approach, comprising a \"bundle\" of complementary practices, rather than a suite of poorly connected initiatives In today's times, the significance of corporate leadership vis-a\u0300-vis corporate performance is, perhaps, best illustrated by the relative impact of the global financial crisis on major financial institutions.", "The severity of the crisis has forced academics, regulators and policymakers to do some serious rethink on the current financial system.", "Many have also seen this crisis as a failure of leadership, both on the regulatory and participant sides of the financial universe.", "Debates and discourses on the current regulatory architecture have also since got more intense and louder.", "Much as the regulatory issues have become more and more complex and nuanced, the role of the leaders in the system has also got increasingly in focus, both for future financial stability, as also for efficiency and innovation.", "This, indeed, is a time for transformation.", "There are, in fact, significant differences between change and transformation.", "Change is the way things will be different, and transformation is how you move people through the stages to make change work.", "Change is a shift in the externals of any situation, for example, setting up a new programme, restructuring a business, moving to new location, or a promotion.", "By contrast, transformation is the mental and emotional transition that people must undergo to relinquish old arrangements and embrace new ones.", "There are other distinctions too.", "Change is made up of events, while transformation is an on-going process.", "Change is visible and tangible, while transformation is a psychological process that takes place inside people.", "Change can happen quickly, but transformation, like any organic process, has its own natural pace.", "Change is all about the outcome we are trying to achieve; transformation is about how we will get there and how we will manage things while we are en route.", "Getting people through the transition is essential if the change is actually to work, as planned.", "It is important to ensure that change management strategies are driven by the changes that need to occur, but that they do not lose focus on the more personal transition activities needed to ensure the success of the programme.", "Transformation occurs as a result of a well-orchestrated and well-led change strategy and transition plan.", "The result is a metamorphosis to the desired state in which there is a deep seated adoption of the changes and the associated values, principles and/or processes.", "This leads to an embedded, and marked, change in organizational culture and reinforces a journey of continuous improvement.", "Transformational leadership Clearly, transformational leaders have a role to play in the today's organizations to effectively cope with the rapidly changing environment.", "Transformational leadership allows dramatic improvements in management effectiveness.", "Transformational leaders make subordinates aware of how important their jobs are by providing feedback to the worker;
