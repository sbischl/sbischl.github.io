ACT, AND FRAUD!", "The Central Bank does not have any money belonging to fast-money schemes.", "I want to inform the public that the Bank of PNG is an independent institution of the Government and is the banker to the government, not to the public.", "The commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions provide banking and financial to the general public.", "For fast-money scheme operators to pass the blame to the Bank of PNG for withholding their monies from overseas is a blatant lie.", "They themselves have used up the depositors' money.", "The truth is that neither the
