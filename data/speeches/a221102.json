drawing down their excess CRR balances and nonSLR investments.", "Certain banks also took recourse to MSF.", "This episode of liquidity strain is likely to be transitory on account of several factors.", "First, the leakage due to currency demand will slow down after the festival season; and as currency returns to the banking system, the system liquidity will improve.", "Second, government expenditure is likely to pick up after the monsoon season.", "Third, the pace of forex outflows has moderated, which augurs well for system liquidity, going ahead.", "Net FPI investments, which were

depreciated against the US dollar by more than the INR.", "In fact, the INR appreciated against all other major currencies barring of course the US dollar, and a few other currencies I just mentioned.", "The size of the INR's appreciation was the highest vis-a\u0300-vis the Japanese yen (12.4 per cent), the Chinese yuan (5.9 per cent), the Pound sterling (4.6 per cent) and the Euro (2.5

macroeconomic and financial developments.", "Since March 2020, the world has been buffeted by extraordinary and repetitive shocks.", "I have spoken of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine as black swan events.", "There is yet another shock - globalised inflation.", "The most recent shock has been the aggressive and synchronous monetary policy tightening around the world and the accompanying hawkish forward guidance.", "This has pitched the world into a storm.", "The result has been tightening of external financial conditions, capital flight from emerging markets, sharp currency depreciations and reserve losses.", "No country can be immune to these developments.", "Yet the strength of our macro-fundamentals has stood out in comparison with peers, bearing testimony to prudent macroeconomic policies and the resilience of the buffers we have built up.", "An assessment of India's innate strengths can be gauged from a comparison of the state of the economy today after three years of multiple shocks, with the situation during the taper tantrum in 2013 when India was labelled as among the fragile five.", "India's current account deficit had widened to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, clearly above the sustainable level.", "Now at 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 and 2.8 per cent of GDP in June 2022, it has remained within the sustainability threshold.", "The debt service

growth differential with the global economy has improved from 3 per cent in 2013 to 3.8 per cent in 2022.", "The corporate sector balance sheets are strong; the banking system is well capitalised; credit growth is in double digits; and the growth momentum is steadily improving.", "The terminal interest rate that the US Fed is targeting is anybody's guess, but it cannot be the case that it will tighten monetary policy endlessly.", "When the tightening is over, the tide will surely turn.", "Capital flows to India will resume and external financing conditions will ease.", "In this complex world in which both push and pull factors are at play, the INR, which is market-determined, should be allowed to find its level and that is what we have been striving to ensure.", "As I have just explained, the INR has seen a very orderly movement since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.", "We must deal with the global hurricane with confidence, endurance and the courage of our conviction that we will weather this turmoil.", "The current global economy is sailing in extremely turbulent waters.", "Despite humungous challenges, the Indian economy has progressed relatively well.", "I would like to impress upon the banks and businesses to remain focussed on reinforcing their resilience while continuing to grow and meet market demand.", "They should continuously assess
