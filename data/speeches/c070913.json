now we have 18 Banks, 13 non-bank financial institutions with deposittaking transactions, 3 registered bureaux de change, and 5 registered foreign exchange dealers.", "That makes some 40 in all; an eight-fold increase in forty years!", "This is a sign of the expanding economy but at the same time it translates into an increasing challenge for our key function in keeping the system reliable and clean.", "In the speech of the then Minister of Finance, Mr Rama Sithanen, at the 25th anniversary of this Bank, he wisely observed that throughout history we see that: \"evolution depends on small currents as well as great tides...the ability to sense a trend, the will to act on understanding and intuition.\"", "Amid the flux of the future life of the Bank, we must do several things: ensuring continuity, probity, and above all adaptability; securing a stable state within a changing world; making investment more accessible; bank-rolling effective innovation; and playing our part on the regional and global stage.", "We must be willing to learn, though we do not always like being taught!", "As we are opening our doors to over-the-counter sales of Government and Bank instruments to the general public, so we are opening our ears to the best practice and best advice from beyond our walls.", "We are committed to playing a lead role beyond our shores in regional and global banking.", "The African Union has set the future targets to which we are signed up: this agenda includes an African Central Bank; an African Monetary Fund, and an African Development Finance Institution.", "It is of course no state secret that our friends in De La Rue have yet to be asked to tender for printing the new Afro, which must remain for some time to come more an ethnic hairstyle than a unit of regional currency.", "You might ponder on the fact that from Jean Monnet to Jean Claude Trichet - that is from the concept of European money to the final trick of issuing the new notes for Europe - took over 50 years.", "I think we could do better than that!", "My vision of the future includes a wider role for us in promoting greater transparency in Banking, better communication with the public and the banking sector, and greater consumer protection.", "At the heart of transparency and consumer protection are education and effective communication not just with the banking community but with the country at large.", "That is a vital task for all banks in a modern world and especially for the Bank of Mauritius in setting the tone and style for sustainable development.", "We are now becoming the institution that Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam called for in that 1966 debate I referred to earlier, one worthy of developed countries, along with the Development Bank and the Economic Planning Unit.", "In 2004, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) reflected on the success of the development of Mauritius and its banking and financial sector.", "It did not see the story as one of seamless progress.", "Where Meade had presented the haunting vision of catastrophe ahead in the 1960's, the IDRC paper highlighted the downside, for example in the 1980's, and listed the challenges ahead.", "The IDRC underlined the severe economic setbacks of 25 years ago, soaring unemployment, rapid inflation, acute foreign exchange shortages, low reserves, public sector finance in a shambles, low investments, increasing debt and the rest of it.", "But by 1988, with the success of the EPZ sector, more favourable terms of trade and falling oil prices, those dark clouds had dissipated and near full-employment was reached.", "The relative success of Mauritius which is evident in a regional perspective, was not dependent on a single factor or a formula that could be replicated elsewhere.", "Key elements included the following: political stability - Mauritius is not considered a high risk country politically - strong chambers of agriculture and commerce, an educated population, a probusiness government, fresh COMESA preferential trade (with many opportunities yet to be exploited) for niche markets, the unfolding of the policies of the regional hub, delocalisation of production, and more investment in other countries in the region such as Madagascar, Mozambique, Lesotho, Cote d'Ivoire by then being exploited.", "The IDRC recipe for continued success requires sound macro-economic management to sustain international competitiveness, bringing unemployment down to 2% without jeopardising inflation, reducing public sector expenditure to 22% of GDP, bringing more banks into the financial sector to promote competition, a foreign-exchange management monitoring committee, greater productivity and competitiveness, co-ordinated mechanisms for promoting investment, R&D, low and uniform level of protection, and more effective negotiations at the WTO.", "We give thanks for the lives of those who over the last forty years have given their services to this Bank; the foundations on which a great Bank is built.", "In the Jeux des Isles one of the concluding events is the relay where the athletes complete their run and then pass the baton to the next and so on towards the winning line.", "At this anniversary event we take on that baton passed to us from the former Governors here, Board members and staff, with the determination to compete in the future to match and outmatch their performance, adapting our stride to the new course as it unfolds.", "In keeping with the occasion we are presenting to the President and to the Prime Minister a newly-carved large wooden Dodo.", "This bird is the traditional icon of the Bank of Mauritius.", "In the English language, our bird has achieved an unenviable notoriety representing, as it does, the grim finality of species extinction.", "We are taking the liberty of also placing a replica of this carving in the new entrance hall of the brand-new Bank of Mauritius Tower, as a continuing reminder to all of us who work here of the fate that becomes a species that fails to adapt to its ever-changing environment and the threat from new predators!", "Once again, thank you for honouring us with your presence tonight.", "And thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Monetary Policy", "Economic Development", "Inflation Targeting", "Central Banking", "Financial Stability", "Banking and Finance", "Savings and Investment", "Financial Regulation", "Economic Resilience", "Social Responsibility"]}
