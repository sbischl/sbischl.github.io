Corsello for assistance in preparing this speech.", "The opinions expressed are my own.", "Friedman, M. (1963), 'Inflation Causes and Consequences', Asian Publishing House.", "the opposite side, and the idea of any relationship between money and prices that was relevant for monetary policy was gradually forgotten.", "After all, inflation by definition only exists in relation to money, and PY=MV is an identity; while V is everything but 'extremely stable', as Friedman would have it, it seems difficult to believe that there is no technological and/or behavioural internal logic to it that will reassert itself sooner or later.", "In recent years, in fact, interest in the analysis of monetary aggregates and of the relationship between money growth and inflation has started to grow again.'", "In the autumn of 2022, in a speech prepared for the presentation of an Italian translation of Friedman and Schwartz's book, I discussed this renewed academic and policy attention.", "During today's speech, I shall address some of the points mentioned on that occasion and expand upon them to include a few more recent developments.", "I shall first present evidence on monetary and inflation developments in the euro area in recent years.", "Then, I shall touch on the current debate on money and inflation, and offer some qualitative views on the issue and the possible policy implications.", "Figure 1 shows the evolution over time of central bank reserves, currency in circulation, M1, and M3-M11 in the euro area.", "Figure 1.a plots the ratio of the monetary aggregates to nominal GDP, while Figure 1.b plots the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregates.", "Some remarkable developments are apparent.", "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, M1 also grew significantly, though at a less spectacular pace.", "It accelerated in the early months of the pandemic: between January and June 2020, the M1/GDP ratio rose from 2.9 to 3.7, that is, by roughly as much as it had over the previous five years.", "Since the start of 2022 the ratio has fallen, returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023Q3.", "M3 rose by much less over the same period; the ratio of M3-M1 to GDP therefore declined between 2009 and mid-2022, from 2.3 to 1.3; since then, it has been increasing again.\u00b0 With all this, there was no surge in inflation before 2021; if anything, the opposite happened.", "Annual headline HICP inflation and the core component had averaged 2.2 n the United States, the instability of money demand prompted a change from monetary aggregates to short-term interbank interest rates as an operational target.", "The ECB/Eurosystem adopted monetary aggregates as a 'first pillar' at inception, but - again, based on evidence - has since shifted to other indicators.", "As the ultimate compass or monetary policy, inflation targeting, pioneered by New Zealand in the late 1980s, has been adopted by many central banks.", "See for example, Acharya, V. and Rajan, R.

pandemic.", "In 2021 the situation suddenly changed.", "Headline inflation accelerated dramatically during the year and kept growing in the following year, until peaking at double digits in the last quarter of 2022.", "It then started to fall, also rapidly, to an annual average of 5.4 per cent in 2023.", "Core inflation peaked a bit later than headline inflation, reflecting delayed pass-through of the shock to business costs and final prices.", "How has the relationship between money and inflation changed in recent years?", "What role have the peculiar shocks that have hit the economy in the 2020s played?", "And how have they interacted with the ECB's monetary policy?", "The central bank had impressed a deliberate, powerful monetary impulse on the economy after the GFC and, especially, after the sovereign debt shock.", "This action was motivated by the fear of financial meltdown and of a breakdown of the euro ('Whatever it takes').", "After 2014, however, the main concern had begun to be the risk of deflation, given that price increases had moved downward and remained persistently below target.", "As policy rates approached their effective lower bound, the ECB, like many of its peers, resorted to QE, establishing its asset purchasing programme (APP) in 2015.", "The APP entailed the purchase of low-risk long-term assets.", "This was meant to create a shortage of such assets in the market, which would increase their price or, equivalently, reduce their yield.", "Through portfolio rebalancing, the reduction would propagate to other assets, reducing the cost of financing for households and firms, and stimulating aggregate demand.", "Over the several years in which quantitative programmes were in place, the central bank balance sheet expanded.", "As we have just seen, monetary aggregates increased significantly.", "Both inside and outside money were affected: the former thorough the accumulation of reserves, the latter through the expansion of credit by the financial system that the former made possible.", "To the extent that the securities that the central bank purchases under QE come from the portfolios of households or (non-bank) firms, the increase in reserves is accompanied by an increase in bank deposits.", "In line with quantity theory, this increase is independent of the private sector's demand for money.", "The increase in the holding of liquid assets by the private sector was favoured by the very low opportunity costs of money.", "In a low interest rate environment, agents are effectively indifferent between holding the overnight deposits obtained in exchange for the safe assets sold to the central bank, and holding long-term safe assets, since the returns are similar (Figure 3).", "Inflation proved stubbornly low for several years.", "Even before inflationary pressures materialised, however, a debate had started on the risks of monetary policy being too accommodative for too long.", "Some suggested that too many years of easy financing conditions could encourage the financing of inefficient investments and thus result in a sub-optimal allocation of financial resources and a persistently lower potential output.\u00ae Others, referring to the financial instability hypothesis developed by Minsky in 1992,' argued that the prolonged period of low interest rates induced financial firms to take on excessive risk in search of higher returns.", "Faced with the urgent need to provide additional monetary accommodation as a response to the financial stability and real economy concerns that had dramatically reappeared, and with policy rates already at the lower bound, the ECB added the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to its existing quantitative toolkit.", "As we have seen, this further increased the amount of reserves and bank overnight deposits, and further reduced long-term interest rates.", "In 2021-2022, with the pandemic emergency largely behind us but the PEPP still very much in place, inflation was reignited after many years.", "Specifically, in 2021, as the world economy recovered from the COVID lockdowns faster than many had expected, worldwide bottlenecks emerged: increased delivery times, higher shipping costs and rising raw material prices created strong upstream pressures on prices.", "Most importantly for the euro area (given its energy dependency), the post-pandemic recovery started to cause imbalances between supply and demand in the oil and gas markets as early as mid-2021.", "Russia's aggression against Ukraine (early 2022) then caused oil and gas costs to escalate further, leading to a shock in energy prices the like of which the world had not seen for half a century.", "The supply shocks triggering this inflationary wave in the euro area were exogenous (Figure 4).", "They did occur at a time when liquidity was very abundant and interest rates very low.", "However, as long as pipeline pressures to inflation were muted, i.e.", "until 2020, inflation had been contained and below target despite the ultra-expansionary monetary policy.", "As I mentioned at the outset, interest in the relationship between monetary aggregates and inflation trends has been rekindled in the light of what we have observed in the most recent period.", "Let me briefly mention just a few contributions.", "In a recent speech,\u00ae Isabel Schnabel
