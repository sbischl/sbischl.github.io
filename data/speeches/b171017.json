it embodies the highest standards of integrity, ethics and responsible conduct.", "This is what I believe differentiates a trusted adviser from a merely reliable one.", "One way of achieving this is by holding financial advisers accountable to a strong code of ethics.", "In this regard, it is heartening to note that the Association already requires its members to abide by the code of ethics for the financial sector issued by the Financial Services Professional Board.", "Going forward, the Association may consider refining this code of ethics to better reflect the specificities of the financial advisory industry.", "For improved efficacy, the code should also be complemented, if I may suggest, by rigorous monitoring and strong enforcement.", "To this end, I would like to suggest the Association spearhead the development of an oversight programme aimed at identifying and responding to misconduct risks in a timely manner.", "Perspectives from members could contribute towards crafting more creative, practical and effective monitoring mechanisms, such as members' compliance report cards.", "To further elevate the professionalism of financial advisers, Bank Negara Malaysia is currently reviewing the fit and proper requirements.", "These requirements will specify, among others, the factors to be observed in the assessment and appointment of key responsible persons, such as members of the Board and CEOs of the financial advisers, and financial advisers' representatives.", "Adoption of these standards we hope will help to strengthen the credibility of the profession.", "Another aspect that is closely linked to professionalism is transparency.", "It is for this reason that the Bank has introduced additional disclosure requirements through the LIFE framework.", "These disclosures are intended to ensure that appropriate and fair advice is given to consumers who purchase insurance.", "Mandatory sales illustrations have also been enhanced.", "Additionally, all intermediaries now have to provide a service guide to help insurance buyers better understand the advice and services to which they are entitled.", "Instead of viewing these as requirements to be complied with, I would like to encourage financial advisers to take advantage of these disclosure tools to help customers fully understand what they are paying for.", "This will go a long way in establishing yourselves as trusted advisers.", "Upholding independence The second feature of a trusted adviser is independence.", "When consumers seek financial advice, they expect to get an objective point of view that places their best interest above all else.", "And rightly so -

the adaptability to change.", "Traditionally, financial advisers have been a staple for high net-worth individuals.", "Gen Ys have rarely been reached, reinforcing the unfortunate perception that financial advisory services are an \"outdated\" concept, or simply not for younger generation.", "This must change going forward, as this generation represents a large untapped market for financial advisers, and will continue to grow in importance as their wealth increases over time.", "Whether financial advisers adapt successfully in reaching out to Gen Ys depends on their ability to understand the unique characteristics of this demographic.", "Gen Ys actively compare products using a wide range of information, such as online research, social media and peer reviews.", "They are also accustomed to services being convenient, real-time and on-demand.", "Within the context of financial advisory, engaging Gen Ys may also have a specific challenge - that is, planning for long-term goals such as retirement or wealth accumulation may take a back seat to more immediate needs.", "To meet these demands, financial advisers must be flexible enough to employ a range of engagement methods.", "For example, financial advisers should take advantage of social media platforms as part of their marketing strategies.", "Financial advisers could also leverage on interactive online platforms to better engage with Gen Ys.", "Recently, tech start-ups are launching applications to match consumers seeking financial advice to financial advisers seeking customers.", "These applications are using a \"matchmaking concept\" to link customers to trustworthy financial advisers, based on their unique investing needs and personality.", "In addition, different pricing strategies could also be explored.", "These should be commensurate with the profile of a prospective Gen Y customer.", "For example, fees can be adjusted in proportion to a younger customer's income level, rather than linked to assets under management, as is typically the case now.", "Flat fees or hourly charges may also be considered for customers with smaller account balances.", "I have spoken at length about the key tenets of a trusted adviser today, but I also understand that transforming the profession into where it needs to be in the future is not something that can happen overnight.", "Like any other transformation, the effort will require meticulous planning, strategy and sheer determination through the many changes to come.", "Professionalism, independence and adaptability will all be hard-won victories.", "While Bank Negara Malaysia stands ready to support initiatives in this direction, it is the industry that must ultimately collaborate to create the business models and value propositions that will define the financial advisory services of the future.", "The Association serves as an excellent platform for such collaboration, with the potential participation of 618 registered financial advisers' representatives to date.", "I welcome the innovations that are to come from the Association and the members.", "I began today's speech with Confucius, and I'd like to close with another pearl of wisdom from his analects -
