U.S. deficit through reserve accumulation, effectively impeding real exchange rate adjustment.", "In the short run, this combination of policies provides a fiscal boost, but it does not last.", "In response to the rising public debt burden, global interest rates begin to rise, crowding out private investment and ultimately lowering potential growth.", "This, in turn, further worsens the fiscal

imbalances reassert at an explosive rate.", "Paths for public and external debt are unsustainable and could lead to another crisis.", "An obvious lesson to draw from this scenario is that advanced countries need to engage in fiscal consolidation over the medium term.", "Indeed, that is the express policy of all industrialised countries.", "But would that alone be sufficient to rebalance the global economy?", "Consider a second scenario in which there is fiscal consolidation in advanced countries such that debt-to-GDP stabilizes by 2015 (Chart 4).", "Other countries maintain current policies.", "In particular, there is neither a real effective exchange rate adjustment nor an increase in the trend of domestic demand growth in Asia's emerging economies.", "In this scenario, there is deficient demand globally.", "With monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound, deflation emerges.", "As a consequence, real interest rates increase sharply, growth stalls, and fiscal consolidation becomes more difficult.", "It is cold comfort that global imbalances are effectively eliminated.", "The cost is a prolonged global recession, with massive foregone output.", "If this scenario were to occur, the risk of protectionism would undoubtedly rise, potentially exacerbating the damage.", "Finally, consider a \"framework scenario,\" one that highlights the large gains that the G-20 process could - and should - produce (Chart 5).", "In this case, the fiscal consolidation of the second scenario is complemented by policies to increase domestic demand in emerging Asia and a modest real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar (across all major currencies).", "In this case, current account imbalances stabilize at low levels and, more importantly, global growth rises to

hours in the sun, while the surplus countries are ants prudently husbanding resources in anticipation of winter.", "The problem with this diagnosis is that it ignores the symbiotic nature of the global economy.", "Excess savings in some countries go hand-in-hand with excess dissavings in others.", "Taken to the extreme, the husbanding of resources makes the economic winter more likely.", "The thrift of the Swabian housewife or the obsessive self-insurance of the emerging giants is globally debilitating and self-defeating.", "Hegel's observation that all societies die from the morbid intensification of their own first principles comes to mind.", "The drivers of domestic demand cannot be concentrated in the same countries forever.", "As the Managing Director of the IMF has suggested, not all countries can simultaneously export their way to growth.", "The framework process does not appeal to a country's altruism.", "As shown in Table 1, the framework scenario is pareto improving - every region is better off under it.", "The second issue is coordination.", "To stimulate private domestic demand, surplus countries could enhance their social safety nets, reform financial systems to liberate trapped savings from small and medium-sized enterprises, and sharpen relative price signals (in part through greater exchange rate flexibility).", "While it is in their own interests to implement these policies, surplus countries could be further encouraged by industrialised countries implementing the necessary complementary measures.", "In particular, industrialised countries must develop credible medium-term plans for fiscal consolidation and implement them once the recovery is firmly entrenched.", "Moreover, it is essential that industrialised countries, particularly those at the epicentre of the financial crisis, implement a series of financial reforms to increase the resilience of the global financial system.", "This means more and better bank capital, improved market infrastructure for derivatives and funding markets, and a series of initiatives to end \"too-big-to-fail.", "\"21 It will not be enough to propose.", "Measures must also be credibly implemented.", "That is why the peer review process of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and external reviews by the IMF are so important.", "Through these processes, financial reforms

price stability.", "I will now turn to this issue in Canada before concluding.", "Update on the inflation outlook The global economy has evolved largely as expected.", "Strong growth in many emergingmarket economies has been accompanied by positive though uneven growth in most advanced countries.", "Although the level of economic activity is now somewhat higher than projected, the outlook for inflation and economic growth in the global economy over the near term remains essentially unchanged, with exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus continuing to provide important support in many countries.", "Economic activity in Canada has surprised slightly on the upside in recent weeks relative to the projection in our January Monetary Policy Report.", "Growth has been driven mainly by domestic demand, but exports have also recovered further in response to improving external demand.", "Significant policy stimulus, combined with increased confidence, improved financial conditions, and higher terms of trade, are the main factors supporting growth in Canada's domestic demand.", "At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and the low absolute level of U.S. demand in certain key sectors, such as autos and housing, will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada.", "Core inflation has been slightly firmer than projected, the result of both transitory factors and the higher level of economic activity.", "The outlook for inflation should continue to reflect the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply.", "At its 2 March 2010 decision, the Bank reconfirmed that the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target.", "This commitment is expressly conditional on the outlook for inflation, which will be updated in the Bank's next Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 22 April.", "In conclusion, the twin challenges of boosting Canadian productivity and of implementing the G-20 framework globally are daunting.", "But the gains are considerable.",

productivity.", "We are working with our domestic and international partners to reform the global financial system.", "We are active participants in G-20 framework discussions, not merely because they offer the best outcome for the global economy but also because they are in Canada's interests.", "Finally, and most fundamentally, the Bank has an unwavering commitment to price stability.", "The single, most direct contribution that monetary policy can make to sound economic performance is to provide Canadians with confidence that their money will retain its purchasing power.", "That means keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable.", "Price stability lowers uncertainty, minimizes the costs of inflation, reduces the cost of capital, and creates an environment in which households and
