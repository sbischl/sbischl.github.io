and abroad.", "How tight monetary policy will be is essentially contingent on how fast wage growth is brought down.", "The inflation targets adopted by Norway and our trading partners imply that total wage growth of about 41\u20442 per cent is consistent with little or no change in business sector competitiveness.", "This is based on the assumption that productivity growth in Norway is around 2 per cent, or about the same as the average for the past 20 years.", "Both companies and employees can take as a given that inflation will be 21\u20442 per cent over time.", "This reduces uncertainty and

growth and high employment.", "The experience of the 1990s demonstrates this.", "During that period unemployment fell and growth was strong.", "Even with major restructuring and changes in industry structure, inflation was close to 21\u20442 per cent.", "Growth in real wages is now markedly higher than the underlying growth in productivity.", "This is why unemployment is rising.", "Businesses

in service industries is more mixed.", "Import firms have wider margins.", "We know that employment in some service industries has fallen.", "This may indicate that many service enterprises have adjusted their workforces.", "To some extent, higher costs can more easily be passed on to customers through higher prices in this sector.", "This picture is typical of the final phase of an expansion.", "A tight labour market and the contest for economic resources lead to a sharp increase in real wages.", "This results in high growth in household income, consumption and housing investment.", "The propensity to borrow increases and house prices rise sharply.", "On the other hand, the business sector faces pressures on profitability, a high cost level and declining

an end.", "The cost level must be adjusted to restore balance in the labour market.", "Wage formation in Norway is subject to an institutional and statutory framework and agreements that have been developed over several decades.", "The result of negotiations is influenced by labour legislation, including regulations relating to job protection, unemployment benefits and the rules that apply to cooperation and settlement of industrial disputes.", "In important segments of the labour market, there appears to have been a shift in the social partners' strategic position in negotiations in favour of employees.", "Technological changes, increased demands for stable supplies and intensified international competition have made enterprises in many industries ever more vulnerable to even short operational disruptions.", "The employers' ability and willingness to take on open labour conflicts have therefore diminished.", "On the other hand, corporate boards and management are responsible for decisions on expansions, closures, rationalisation, location and workforce increases.", "Unions have little direct influence on these matters.", "If company costs increase, either productivity must be improved, production closed or relocated to another country.", "This is the companies' arena.", "Their decisions concerning operations, investment and location are in turn determined by the required rate of return that owners set to keep their capital in the company.", "Under these operating parameters, developments in labour costs essentially reflect employees' and

high pay increases should be.", "The pay increases for white-collar workers in the business and financial sector and academics in the public sector have been particularly high.", "For a long period, this mirrored the high wage growth for liberal professions, consultancy firms, law firms and the IT industry.", "However, wage growth for whitecollar workers and academics appears to be holding up even with weaker labour market conditions for these groups.", "In many places in our country, public sector wages are higher than the level that can be sustained by local businesses in a less favourable economic environment.", "It may appear that wages for white-collar workers are first increased in line with that of other groups and then supplemented by individual increases based on performance and profits.", "The overall rise in wages does not seem to be adapted to the situation now faced by many enterprises or to an ample supply of labour.", "The system for determining these groups' wages may be an unnecessary source of cost increases for enterprises and public entities.", "Last year's wage settlements resulted in wide differences in pay increases across different groups.", "This may give rise to renewed tension between occupational groups and new wage spirals.", "Because substantial pay increases negotiated in 2002 will take effect in 2003, wage growth will also be high this year even without any new generous pay increases.", "It may take time and be very costly for business and public entities to resolve the problems caused by last year's wage
