preserving financial stability, while allowing sufficient flexibility for banking institutions to design their own strategies and market niches, the regulatory approach is increasingly focussed on developing broad prudential guidelines and principles, rather than prescribing common requirements across institutions and activities.", "The Central Bank is therefore moving away from prescribing

institutions have the necessary capacity in terms of internal controls and systems to undertake and manage risks.", "This, therefore, does not mean less regulation.", "As the strength of individual

customisation stage.", "Such new applications need to be reviewed as to how they will contribute towards improving product and services delivery, aid in risk management activities, and enhance management capability.", "Opportunities from regional integration Ladies and Gentlemen: Another important development that is taking place is the growing regional integration, driven by increasing

range of financial products.", "These opportunities may also be realised by setting up presence in new markets.", "It can also be in the form of partnerships or strategic acquisition of an existing banking institution in a foreign market.", "Mergers or alliances in services and products can be pursued through co-branding or complementary products, delivery channels and marketing or product development.", "Alliances can also be formed to capitalise on intangible assets such as human capital.", "Such alliances can also translate into increased innovation in processes, structures, business models and ultimately innovation in products and services.", "Indeed, strategic alliances have been growing, cutting across many industries and business segments.", "As banking institutions are able to fulfil the differentiated demands and expectations, this would enhance their capacity to compete in both the domestic and external markets and thus be able to capture the opportunities accorded from liberalisation and globalisation.", "Customer-centric banking system Ladies and Gentlemen: As the financial landscape evolves and competition intensifies, banking institutions need to respond to the changing market needs, and continually reassess strategies and alternatives in this rapidly changing and dynamic market and shift from just the traditional offerings.", "Consumers are becoming increasingly discerning and demanding.", "Strategic decisions about the future needs to be made to sustain the ability to offer and deliver unique value propositions to customers whilst at the same time effectively managing customers' expectations.", "An area that banking institutions may venture into is micro-financing.", "Micro-enterprises perform an important economic activity for a large segment of the country's population.", "While institutional arrangements are being put in place to increase access to financing for such micro-enterprises, the banking sector with its large network of branches can become an important channel for such financing.", "These could be provided via a micro-financing window.", "Global experience has shown that such microfinancing operations can be successful and profitable with good loan portfolio quality.", "As part of the efforts to raise the quality performance in the financial services sector, Bank Negara Malaysia initiated a nation-wide survey in 2003 to assess the requirements, expectations and the satisfaction level of consumers on the quality of products and services offered by banking institutions.", "While the primary objective of the study is to develop an index on the levels of quality of customer service, the findings indicate that the real issues in enhancing the industry's level of performance goes beyond this, towards developing a stronger customer-centric orientation.", "The findings provide a discernable indication of the differences in customer needs and requirements, and identify specific areas where customer-orientation issues tend to arise.", "Let me briefly share some of the key findings of the survey.", "The findings reveal that while the general level of customers' satisfaction is favourable, the relationship between customers and the banking institutions needs to be improved.", "While one in three customers is satisfied with the banking relationship, it did not imply loyalty.", "The survey also identified factors that customers are looking for in their banking relationship.", "Among the primary needs are the quality of interface with bank staff; and the effectiveness and efficiency of delivery channels, in particular branch banking and ability to deliver effective service in transacting and the efficiency in application processing.", "Secondary requirements represent potential leverage factors which can be used to substantially improve overall customer relationship.", "These include product innovativeness with value-added features and electronic banking including internet banking.", "These secondary core needs would become primary drivers and important elements in banking relationship.", "Additionally, the survey indicated that younger and middle-income individuals, a growing customer segment, prefer to use ATMs and electronic channels.", "Another growing segment is the \"Older Affluent\", in the middle and higher income levels.", "Given the growing size of this customer segment and their higher income level, they require a wider range of innovative investment products that offer safe and steady returns as well as personalised financial advisory services.", "The challenge therefore is for the industry to pro-actively respond to these customer priorities now rather than waiting for increased customer churning.", "Fundamental to achieving greater customer-centricity is to ensure that the staff, processes and orientations are aligned towards fulfilling customers' expectations and delivering superior customer's experience.", "Of importance is to have clarity of purpose that is communicated, shared and understood by all levels of staff, especially the front-office staff.", "Having a culture that is built around such commonality of purpose will ensure consistent service performance.", "Another further aspect is the design of the operational processes with customers' perspective in mind to ensure easy access, speedy and accurate execution of transactions that are responsive to many facets of customers' demands.", "To facilitate this, it is essential that banking institutions embrace the relevant technology to support business processes, enhance risk management capabilities while at the same time provide seamless access to customers through a wider range of delivery channels.", "All these need to be supported with an effective human resource management framework that ensures the availability of best talent and the right skills.", "As competition intensifies, banking institutions increasingly must be able to deliver personalised and customised financial solutions.", "Therefore, it is important for institutions to understand the dynamics of customer segmentation, build customer relationship and address requirements and preferences of specific segments.", "Understanding specific segments requires banking institutions to understand complex intangibles such as customer behaviour, motivation and life events.", "Sustainable growth will be very much dependent on the ability to develop lasting and profitable relationships with customers.", "Investing in new products in meeting the complex customer needs and demands is important.", "Equally important is the need to develop an effective communication plan or strategy as a package to product delivery.", "Even the best of products would not have a good chance of success without a well-conceived communication strategy.", "This goes beyond marketing and advertisement.", "It would include educating customers to adapt to the new ways of doing banking transactions or changes being introduced and to use the innovative products being offered.", "It is also interesting to note that the survey findings clearly indicated the importance of quality interface between customers and banks.", "As such, numerous interface points need to be reengineered to ensure the right mix of the virtual and physical environment.", "New branch models have emerged, incorporating features from both virtual and physical environment, to fulfil the varying needs of different localities and market segments.", "Ladies and Gentlemen: While the new emerging trends in both the domestic and global economy will have significant implications on the domestic financial landscape, each banking institution will need to be able to formulate differentiated strategies to effectively respond to these forces in a strategic manner.", "Thus, the ability to precisely assess the institutions individual capabilities and strengths as well as opportunities in this changing environment is key to facilitate effective strategic management at the organisational level.", "Through this process, I envisage that the domestic financial landscape will evolve into a banking environment characterised by three types of banking institutions that will emerge to meet the future demands of the economy.", "First, large Malaysian banks with nationwide and regional and international presence that are able to compete with global financial players; b.", "Second, banking institutions with nationwide presence that are able to offer a broad range of financial products and services; and c. Third, specialist niche players delivering specialised value added products and services for specific segments of the market.", "Ladies and Gentlemen: The financial services industry has evolved considerably over the recent period.", "New emerging trends have provided us with new opportunities in our quest to create a dynamic financial system that will best serve our economy.", "In striving towards high performance and world-class standards in the industry, we look forward to working with you in this dynamic and challenging environment to achieve this common goal.", "Let me now conclude and wish you a most productive Summit."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["customer-centric", "banking system", "financial stability", "prudential regulation", "risk management", "ICT investment", "regional integration", "micro-financing", "customer satisfaction", "strategic management"]}
