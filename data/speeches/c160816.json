approach ensures a transparent basis of Shariah rulings by the SAC, and provides a convergent in understanding between Shariah scholars and industry practitioners.", "In judiciary matters, where the SAC serves as a reference point in analysing muamalat cases, the court can also draw on these comprehensive and transparent Shariah standards as basis in arriving at a court ruling.", "The adoption of the standards by learning institutions will pave the way for greater understanding and acceptance of these standards as a global starting point of reference for the Islamic finance community.", "As we launch the Educator's Manual, which is the first of 14 series of manuals, I would like to share my thoughts on our approach in developing the Shariah standards, and would also like to emphasise the

Manual; reconfiguration of academic programmes and strategising talent deployment.", "The future growth of Islamic finance, especially cross border, is very much dependent on the harmonisation and mutual recognition of Shariah views and rulings across the globe.", "It is critical if cross border trades are to be strengthened.", "Numerous efforts are being pursued to narrow the opinion gaps between scholars through symposiums, roundtables as well as bilateral dialogues.", "However, narrowing of Shariah opinions is preferable but not critical.", "The fact is, differences in views and opinions among scholars are a historical fact, and an accepted facet in the area of Shariah, particularly in matters relating to fiqh muamalat (jurisprudence).", "In fact, my own view is that great Islamic civilisation of yesteryears was possible and the envy of many because of our diversity, tolerance and mutual respect of each other's view.", "In the context of the Shariah Standards, the dynamic process of its development involves the act of harmonising the differences and embracing diversity.", "We respect views of others which are different from ours by looking into the wisdom of earlier scholars from all recognised schools of thought (Mazhabs).", "We are also willing to arrive at new rulings where it is appropriate.", "This broadens the reference scope for Shariah scholars to have an enriching debate on the best application of Shariah in contemporary finance, based on the customs, legal and operational framework of each market.", "This is an important principle, as it increases the depth of fiqh research that leads to greater understanding of practices in Muamalat through the times while recognising the influence of local tradition, as well as domestic business practices.", "The act of balancing the authenticity and practicality of the different Shariah interpretations is an important component in seeking a solution for the benefits and welfare of the

the sacred objectives of Shariah.", "I very much believe in the importance of embracing diversity in Shariah interpretations within the academic community.", "Students who are exposed to the teachings of all schools of thought from the very beginning would get to appreciate the intellectual differences and value the flexibility arising from differing opinions.", "This provides an opportunity to open and sharpen their minds and widen their thinking by exploring issues from multidimensional perspectives.", "Through this way, the talent that we nurture and produce would not only be equipped with Shariah know-hows, but also with intellectual courage that can articulate contemporary Shariah issues in the context of domestic customs and business environment.", "I would like to expand my thoughts on the two additional areas that, if pursued could further enhance stakeholder gains from the Educator's Manual: \u2022 First, is the reconfiguration of academic programmes to nurture talent with enhanced employability; and \u2022 Second, strategising talent deployment to reduce time to competency.", "Reconfiguration of academic programmes Continuous enhancements of curriculums in universities are critical to increase the employability factor of our students.", "These include reconfiguration of the academic programmes at universities and enhancements to the learning tools and methods of teaching.", "This adds to the traditional pedagogy to ensure its dynamism through evolving times, while providing the right learning environment that can challenge the minds and sharpen the skills and experience of our students.", "One such addition is experiential learning.", "The adoption of experiential learning opens the window of opportunity for students to go beyond theory-based teaching.", "Examples include industry-wide internship, real life problem solving assignments and apprenticeship programmes for students.", "These methods create greater connection between classroom learning with the real world.", "I believe this form of experiential learning is a strong stimulant to knowledge acquisition that encourages students to develop their skills while experiencing responsible decision making in real-time.", "Experience in real life situations differentiates experiential learning from cognitive and behavioural learning.", "This provides the students with a competitive edge and increases the probability of success for graduates at entry-level into the workforce.", "Islamic finance industry can contribute significantly towards experiential learning.", "Malaysia, with its long history that includes the development of Islamic finance over three decades is content rich and ideal for case study research.", "There are many matters and areas that require in-depth research and solutions.", "The case study method is another popular learning tool that has proven to be effective in enhancing and strengthening critical appraisal and understanding among students.", "The case study method also provides an opportunity to discuss multiple perspectives in dealing with issues.", "Within the Islamic finance realm, prospective cases studies can include amongst others the application of Shariah Standards by Islamic banks and its effects on product structuring and pricing strategy, legal aspects, risk management, oversight function and governance process of the banks.", "For the takaful sector, case studies on microtakaful for example can lead to the development of protection schemes that can be offered at affordable prices.", "I trust the academia has enough resources to produce such case studies and generate new research findings and breakthroughs, given the knowledge and expertise of their academic faculties.", "In essence, we need to be more exploratory and brave to rigorously investigate or examine real life situations and complex scenarios and benefit from hindsight and learnt lessons that can give new solutions for future growth.", "The initiative to develop the Educator's Manual is in itself a good starting point to encourage universities to move towards experiential learning.", "Students will be exposed to Shariah and operational requirements covering areas such as product structuring, legal, accounting as well as risk management.", "The transparent nature of the standards would enable students to critique and form their own views and conclusions.", "It is a leap forward to change the paradigm on the theoretical and operational aspects of Shariah applications.", "This initiative is certainly a gamechanger for our Islamic finance education programme.", "This initiative is also an important milestone in terms of academia-industry cooperation in equipping our students with industry relevant and contemporary application of Shariah contracts in Islamic financial products and services.", "Given the new content on the subject matter, a pre-condition to successfully implement the learning guide is to train and expose lecturers to multiple disciplines of subject matters.", "Particularly, as the applications of the Shariah and operational requirements cover various fields that include legal, accounting, risk management and information technology.", "Developmental training is a critical component as it enables the imparting of knowledge effectively.", "Strategising talent deployment While it is acknowledged that the role of learning institutions is essential to develop talent with higher skill sets, the industry also has an important role to ensure effective deployment of graduates as they enter the workforce.", "The number of graduates is indeed increasing at a rapid rate.", "The general feedback of Shariah graduates however is the lack of opportunities for employment.", "But the reality is that the industry still grapples with shortage of the right talent that can lead and energise innovation.", "A solution is to reconcile the expectation gaps of the industry and graduates.", "Talent enrichment program is one area where we can pursue to bring out the best of student talent.", "Enrichment programmes in areas beyond Shariah, such as leadership training at the early stage of recruitment would strengthen the confidence of Shariah students and provide the required exposure for them to understand and appreciate the intricacies of business environment.", "Over the years, the Bank established specialised institutions to enrich the talent ecosystem.", "These institutions, namely INCEIF, ISRA, IBFIM, the Chartered Institute of Islamic Finance Professionals (CIIF) and the Association of Shariah Advisors in Islamic Finance Malaysia (ASAS) have collectively contributed towards sustainable development of professionals and expertise in the industry.", "I am pleased to note that the industry has significantly benefitted from the contribution of these institutions.", "INCEIF is now widely recognised as a global university in Islamic finance and has enrolled more than 2,000 students from 80 countries and produced over 1,000 graduates to date.", "ISRA plays an instrumental role as a dedicated Shariah research arm as well as a knowledge repository for Islamic finance.", "It is known as one of the key players in Islamic finance research globally and has emerged as the top contributor in Islamic finance research between 2011-2013.", "IBFIM, which is the industry training arm, has also made significant achievements with over 6,400 participants attending its training programmes in 2015.", "In raising the bar of professionalism, the Chartered Institute of Islamic Finance Professionals as the first professional body in Islamic finance seeks to promote the highest standards of professional practice amongst Islamic finance practitioners.", "Two standards on the admission of members and accreditation of institutions have been issued in November last year and two more are anticipated in 2016.", "ASAS, with prominent scholars as its members, has also embarked on various initiatives that have contributed towards its objective of inculcating the highest level of professionalism of Shariah advisors.", "Despite all these achievements, we must admit that there is no room for complacency.", "We must continue to establish new grounds and set new thresholds for our organisations towards greater success.", "In this context, I am pleased to inform that the Bank will be forming a Steering Committee made up of representatives from both industry and academia to undertake an indepth review of the strategic positioning of these important organisations.", "It is as part of our efforts to re-energise and reinvent the Islamic finance talent development landscape.", "The collective efforts of everyone here today will determine the path of Islamic finance moving forward.", "A simple yet meaningful event to witness the launching of the Educator's Manual today will be an important learning tool for many of our future students.", "I wish to record again our sincere thanks for the contribution and commitment of many people, particularly from the panel of authors and members of academia and wish everyone continuous success for the
