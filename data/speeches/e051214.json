franchising with other segments of financial sector such as cooperatives, RRBs etc.", "so as to extend the scope of financial inclusion with minimal intermediation cost.", "Since large sections of low income groups transactions are related to deposits and withdrawals, with a view to containing transaction costs, 'simple to use' cash dispensing and collecting machines akin to ATMs, with operating
