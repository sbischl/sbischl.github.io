a cooperative vision that transcends the continent's frontiers and fosters a multilateral approach to global challenges.", "This multilateral approach is now more important than ever since most of the structural challenges facing our economies are global and, therefore, require a global response.", "And Europeans can and should play a key role in promoting this multilateral approach.", "Trade, global barriers and the COVID crisis One crucial area where multilateralism should be promoted globally is trade.", "In the current context, global barriers can only be obstacles to the economic recovery that should follow the dramatic economic crisis caused by the pandemic.", "Take the production of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as examples.", "There are factories located in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Spain, and then there are other materials (such as glass for vials, or refrigerators) from all over the globe.", "The irruption of trade barriers, both for vaccines and some critical medical supplies in the early months of the pandemic, exemplifies the harm a parochial, protectionist view can do to global growth and health.", "In turn, while global supply chains have drawbacks, including their exposure to foreign shocks, they have proved their robustness during the pandemic.", "Firms whose production is more integrated into global value chains have performed better and with least disruption to their output.", "True, the sectors most integrated into the value chains bore the brunt of the initial external shock originating in China.", "But when the pandemic also hit domestic markets, such sectors clearly performed comparatively better, by accommodating the shocks to the domestic economy.", "What lessons are to be learned?", "I think a similar approach to that taken after the Global Financial Crisis is warranted.", "The answer then was not less but more and better integration; deeper, more rules-based, more resilient.", "So too for the role of value chains after the COVID crisis.", "Global supply chains have to be tested, as banks were after the crisis with stress tests.", "And critical supply chains need specific regulation, just like big banks, so vulnerabilities can be detected.", "But the upshot is that the efficient organisation of production at the global level is a public good that needs to be preserved.", "The role of multilateralism after the COVID crisis Trade aside, the present juncture is, in fact, a particularly suitable one for giving fresh impetus to multilateralism.", "Healthwise, the crisis will clearly not be resolved until immunity against the virus has been achieved in all countries.", "On the economic front, divergences in the rate of recovery may be particularly harmful for economies that are in a more vulnerable situation.", "Concerted global action is fundamental both for accelerating vaccine production and for making distribution affordable and fair for everybody.", "In the economic arena, we need some coordination of crisis exit strategies and, in parallel, support for the most vulnerable countries.", "Here, international institutions have a crucial role to play, in coordination with regional institutions and mechanisms.", "The aim is not only to entrench the global economic recovery.", "We must also combat the backsliding in inequality and poverty as a result of the pandemic, and jointly address the common structural challenges arising, for example, from digitalisation and the fight against climate change.", "And, more generally, as former ECB President and now Italian Prime Minister - Mario Draghi - put it: \"one of the main reasons why multilateral institutions exist is to create regulatory convergence, and therefore to increase trust between countries\".", "A role for multilateral institutions that goes way beyond their pure economic mandate.", "As such, the global recovery will be based on trust and solidarity between nations.", "Europe is a case in point.", "Let \u0301s take again the example of vaccines.", "When the prospect of a common vaccination pool and the purchase of vaccines on an uncoordinated basis was aired, European institutions took the decision to cooperate.", "That has allowed vaccines to be provided at the same time for countries with very different production or vaccine-purchase capabilities.", "It is an example of cooperation worth exporting to global vaccination programmes.", "Another example is the case of the policies needed to tackle climate change.", "The European Union has pioneered a system of cross-country carbon emission rights.", "This mechanism, according to recent studies, has led to a reduction of more than 10% in the emissions of regulated companies.", "This coordinated effort has seen the EU commit to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.", "It far exceeds the commitment to cut emissions by at least 40% under the Paris Agreement.", "Again let us view the European Union as a laboratory for what the multilateral effort can - ideally - achieve.", "European economic institutions: unfinished work However, in order for Europe to play this role properly, Europe should deepen its own integration project.", "Only by addressing the remaining challenges of our political and economic integration process, we - European - can aim to contribute decisively to global objectives.", "Let me end these remarks by underlying some of these remaining challenges on the economic front.", "The monetary union is one of the milestones of the European project: a single currency, the euro;
