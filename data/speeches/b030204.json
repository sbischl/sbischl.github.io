vehicles.", "The appreciation of the krone in the first half of last year gradually changed the inflation outlook.", "In isolation, this implied a reduction in interest rates.", "However, the

considerations, we could perhaps have reduced the interest rate last summer.", "But this would have led to fluctuations in output and employment.", "Household and enterprises might have continued to increase their borrowing.", "In addition, we might have been confronted with waning confidence in financial markets and a weaker krone.", "Once the effects of high wage growth had fed through to prices and pushed up inflation, the interest rate would have been raised irrespectively, perhaps to a higher level than has been the case.", "The end result of such a policy would have been wider

of the interest rate differential and the strong krone, the global downturn will have a substantial impact on Norwegian business and industry.", "The government's use of petroleum revenues or expectations of increased spending of petroleum revenues may have contributed to sustaining activity and the strong krone.", "Increased use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget is stimulating demand for goods and services.", "This will intensify the contest for economic resources and pressures in the business sector.", "Mainland GDP in 2002 Percentage change.", "One reason may

"In the budget for 2003, petroleum revenue spending was indeed somewhat higher than 4 per cent of the Petroleum Fund.", "This was because the estimated value of the Petroleum Fund at the end of 2002
