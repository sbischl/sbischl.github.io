of complexity.", "For example, iPhones are the fruits of a more complex manufacturing process than ice-cubes.", "This product network mapping provides new insights into trading opportunities and risks.", "For example, it allows country-specific measures of economic complexity to be constructed.", "These can explain almost three-quarters of the variation in income across countries.", "A one standard deviation rise in a country's \"economic complexity\" has been found to increase its long-term growth rate by a remarkable 1.6% per year.", "If these numbers are even roughly right, this

than the global supply chain.", "Navigating it is more complex still.", "Early in its life, that seemed likely to retard its progress.", "In the early 1990s, web search engines relied on the content of each page to determine its relevance.", "As the web grew, simple keyword search was being overwhelmed by the web's size and complexity.", "By the mid-1990s, search engines were lost in navigation.", "In 1996, two Stanford students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, devised a solution.", "You are all now familiar with its name.", "It was called \"BackRub\".", "Page and Brin saw the links between websites, rather than the content within them, as the key to navigating the web.", "Using that basic intuition, they created a search algorithm which calculated a ranking of the relative importance of every web page in the global network.", "This ranking is known as PageRank.", "By drawing explicitly on the information embedded in the network, PageRank produced dramatically improved

fractions of a second.", "Navigating the web no longer required a specialist pilot; it could be mapped by a novice.", "The World Wide Web had been given an instantaneous backrub.", "That has yielded

some existing indicators of house prices and motor sales.", "And what has allowed the World Wide Web to be Googled in this way?", "(d) Lowering barriers to entry Creating a common language also has the potential to transform the industrial organisation of an industry.", "It does so by simultaneously expanding the frontiers of a global network and by lowering the barriers to entering it.", "This allows new companies, with innovative and superior product offerings, to quickly erode the market share of incumbents.", "Higher productivity and growth have been the fruits.", "Global supply chains are one example.", "Prior to GS1 standards, small suppliers faced an uphill struggle connecting to global supply chains.", "Big suppliers viewed them as unreliable given the costs and difficulty of small suppliers executing real-time inventory management.", "Only large firms with big IT budgets could afford the sunk costs of such systems.", "Today, a real-time inventory management system can be built using GS1 standards for a few thousand dollars.", "Small firms can connect to global product webs, through nodes such as Wal-Mart's central inventory system, in the same way they might connect to a Facebook friend.", "A common language has levelled the playing field between the corner shop and the supermarket.", "The transformative powers of a common language have been even more striking in such well-established industries as publishing, music, advertising, news and retailing.", "For decades, large incumbent firms dominated these markets - EMI, Borders, Tower Records.", "Yet in less than a decade, new entrants with new business processes have completely reshaped the industrial landscape.", "Until 2007, publishing was an industry essentially unaltered since Gutenberg.", "The printing presses, while bigger and faster, would have been recognisable to a fifteenth century printer.", "Copying and distributing a book to the public involved a complex chain of printers, wholesalers and retailers.", "This lengthy supply chain added both risk and cost.", "It also created a significant barrier to entry for new authors who were reliant on publishers to get their physical books onto physical shelves.", "Digital publishing and distribution has fundamentally changed this market.", "Both the books and the shelves are now electronic.", "Authors can now format books for e-readers in a couple of hours.", "Sales platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct give access to a worldwide audience with essentially no upfront costs.", "Supply can close to perfectly match demand as the marginal cost of creating and delivering an eBook is effectively zero.", "This digital revolution has caused barriers to entry to plummet while simultaneously raising returns to author entry: they now receive as much as 85% of the royalties from an eBook, compared to as little as 10% from a physical book.", "Previously unpublished authors now sell millions of books.", "The incumbent middle men - book publishers, distributors and retailers - have found their lunch devoured in one sitting.", "In effect, they have been disintermediated by technology and (in a delicious irony) a common language.", "This pattern has been replicated in the music industry.", "For half a century or more, the music supply chain was unchanged.", "New acts were discovered by large record labels who distributed physical goods (vinyl, tapes or CDs) to retailers for sale to the public.", "Over the past decade, the costs of copying and distributing music have fallen to close to zero.", "As in publishing, barriers to new artist entry have plummeted.", "The middle-men - music production companies and distributors - have seen their piece of the pie eaten.", "And as a direct result of this industrial transformation, the pie itself appears to have grown.", "Studies of the contributors to productivity growth since the 1960s indicate that the two top-performing sectors have been retail and wholesale.", "This is attributed to improvements in business processes in these sectors - the \"Wal-Mart effect\".", "It is also attributed to wider and faster dissemination of innovation courtesy of new entrants.", "Economist W. Brian Arthur believes this digitised network of automated processes, linked by a common language, may have put the world on the cusp of a second industrial revolution.", "Arthur describes a \"second economy\" - the digital root system of the physical economy - and predicts it could become larger than the physical economy within a couple of decades.", "If so, those estimated benefits of a common language - in this case HTML and GS1 rather than Hindi and Mandarin - will need revising upwards.", "Common language for finance Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the international financial

us materially closer to constructing a global financial map.", "The co-ordinates of that map are defined by a fledgling global financial language.", "This global mapping effort is underpinned by two, mutually supporting, pillars: greater financial data to help forge links in the financial information chain and common standards for recording and aggregating these data.", "Progress on data collection has been material.", "The Financial Stability Board is overseeing efforts to improve data, including on global banking interconnections, shadow banks and OTC transactions data.", "Yet the full benefits of this deeper and richer array of financial network information will only be realised if these data can be simply aggregated within and across firms.", "That calls for common data describers and standards.", "Recent legislation recognises that.", "In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act created the US Treasury's Office of Financial Research (OFR), which has as a core objective data standardisation.", "In Europe, the new European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) embeds common data standards across the EU.", "The roots of these legislative initiatives were grown during the

"This set out a vision of common standards which would allow global financial data aggregation.", "Like Berners-Lee's 1989 memo, it was vague but exciting.", "But in the reports that followed, two crucial ingredients were identified: a Legal Entity Identifier (or LEI) and a Product Identifier (or PI).", "Though these acronyms are new, the principles underpinning them are not.", "LEIs are effectively the nouns of a new financial vocabulary, naming the counterparties to each financial transaction.", "Meanwhile, PIs are the adjectives of this new vocabulary, describing the elements of each financial transaction.", "Together, LEI-nouns and PI-adjectives are key building blocks of a new common financial language.", "LEIs and PIs have natural counterparts in the world of product supply chains.", "For LEIs read GLNs - the Global Location Numbers that uniquely define nodes in the global supply chain.", "GLNs are ultra-flexible.", "They can denote something as macro as a Wal-Mart warehouse or as micro as a specific shelf in a Wal-Mart store.", "They provide the co-ordinates of a high-definition map of the global supply chain.", "For PIs read GTINs (Global Trade Identification Numbers) and the GDSN (Global Data Synchronisation Network).", "Together, these identifiers define not only products (such as toothpaste) but their attributes (the dimensions of the box the toothpaste is stored in).", "They too are ultra-flexible.", "These identifiers define the DNA string for everything from chocolate wafers to collateral swaps.", "LEIs and PIs are being cast from a similar mould to GLNs and GTINs.", "International efforts so far have focussed on global LEIs.", "These are means of capturing, in a common data string, the old banking maxim of \"know your counterparty\".", "In today's financially interconnected world, knowing your counterparty may be insufficient.", "So global LEIs aim to barcode counterparty linkages at any order of dimensionality.",

use of FpML.", "At a greater level of granularity still, LexiFi is selling a commercial programming language, MLFi, which breaks down financial transactions into their primitive constituents.", "These elements can be combined using a standardised syntax to describe instruments at any level of complexity.", "In essence, this approach is an attempt to create a \"DNA string\" for derivatives.", "As yet, we are some distance from having a consistent global method for financial product identification.", "The prize beyond that, a big one, would be to integrate LEIs and PIs using a commonly-agreed global syntax - an HTML for finance.", "This would allow us to move from words to sentences.", "It would provide an agreed linguistic base for a common financial language.", "Provided this language is flexible enough, like GS1 standards or HTML, it ought to be capable of describing any instrument whatever their underlying complexity.", "Once developed, maintaining and updating this common language

across their balance sheet.", "Even the best-run firms took several hours or days.", "This, too, contrasts starkly with the real-time inventory management systems operating along manufacturing supply chains, not only among the Wal-Marts but among the corner stores.", "These data and risk management problems were well-highlighted in the official report into the failure of Lehman Brothers, a firm whose risk management was felt to be close to the frontier of risk management best practices ahead of the crisis.", "For example, the mistaken exclusion of a significant commercial real estate exposure of $6 billion meant there was serious misreporting to the Lehman's board during the crucial months prior to its failure.", "Information on a significant exposure was lost in translation.", "The aggregation of these individual risk exposures across the balance sheet was also seriously defective.", "From the middle of 2007, individual risk limits at Lehman were breached for the fixed income, real estate and high yield business lines.", "Yet in the process of aggregating these exposures, something too was lost in translation: firm-wide exposures were within risk limits, despite individual components being in breach.", "It is clear that these failures in data infrastructure and aggregation were not unique to Lehman.", "They were endemic across the financial industry.",

data standards could similarly transform consolidated risk management.", "There is no technological reason why slicing and dicing of the aggregate balance sheet could not be done with the same simplicity as searching the web.", "Determining aggregate exposures to a given counterparty or a risk factor is a single cut of the financial web.", "It ought to be as straightforward as Googling Aung San Suu Kyi or Britney Spears.", "(b) Improving risk management across firms Measuring and managing risks across firms was perhaps the single most important cause of the seizure of financial markets during the crisis.", "Counterparty risk reigned supreme.", "In as densely-connected a web as global finance had become, this was hardly surprising.", "Network risk, the risk of cascading dominos, was several orders of magnitude larger than at any time in human history.", "To see that, compare the failure of two financial leviathans only a decade apart.", "When LTCM collapsed in 1998, it had exposures of $150 billion in OTC derivatives with a handful of Wall Street's finest.", "When Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, it had OTC derivatives exposures alone of $800 billion with thousands of counterparties.", "It should have come as a surprise to no-one that the financial bullwhip effect from Lehmans' failure was far more painful than from LTCM.", "That is because, at the time of Lehman's failure, no data existed to monitor meaningfully this network risk.", "Like the supermarket inventories of the early 1970s, the inventory list of bilateral exposures among the world's biggest banks was dog-eared, sparsely populated and out of date.", "Over the past three years, a variety of initiatives have sprung up to fill this vacuum.", "One key plank has been better quality and more frequent data on links between the key global financial nodes - a full matrix of bilateral exposures, on and off balance sheet, between the world's largest financial firms.", "The Financial Stability Board is orchestrating efforts in this area.", "In time, this will become one of the bedrocks of effective risk management across the global financial system.", "Having standardised LEIs will make constructing that counterparty matrix far simpler.", "A second plank of reform has been to put such data to use in helping insulate the global financial network against the failure of one of its key nodes.", "In November 2011, the Financial Stability Board announced that in future the world's most systemically important banks would be required to hold additional capital.", "These systemic surcharges are calibrated according to, among other things, very simple measures of firms' direct interconnectivity with other firms in the global financial network.", "More complete counterparty data, collected according to common standards, would enable a much more accurate calibration of the financial interconnectivity of key financial nodes.", "For example, a number of researchers have already begun to explore using Google's PageRank techniques to determine the systemic risk of financial firms.", "That could in future serve as the basis for calibrating systemic surcharges.", "Where the information web has led, the financial web could follow.", "A third reform plank is the G20 commitment to centrally-clear standardised OTC derivatives.", "This re-wires the global financial web, transforming it from a dense, complex cats-cradle to a simplified hub-and-spokes configuration.", "The dimensionality of the web is then radically compressed and counterparty risk management thereby simplified.", "Network risk, at least in principle, is much reduced.", "It is easy to see how common standards for identifying products and counterparts would support this shift to central clearing.", "If clearing houses are not themselves to become a new manifestation of the too-big-to-fail problem, clearing house risk management will need to be transformed.", "For example, the setting of margin to cover risks to the clearing house relies on real-time information on aggregate exposures to counterparties and products.", "Common standards for data, LEIs and PIs, make that a more realistic prospect.", "A fourth dimension of the reform agenda is to make the resolution of the world's largest financial firms easier and speedier.", "The resolution of complex firms is rarely either.", "Reconciling competing claims on Lehman Brothers' asset pool has already taken insolvency practitioners three and a half years and thousands of man hours.", "It will take many more years before it is complete.", "Homogenised information systems, which can be aggregated across business line and counterparty, could transform this resolution process.", "This relies on effective and timely information systems on the key counterparties and the key risk exposures.", "Counterparty traceability, like counterfeit drug traceability, is central to containing the panic once failure occurs.", "For both, a common language is key.", "(c) Mapping the network The maps of the financial world being used and developed by regulators today broadly resemble those used and developed by cartographers in the 15th century.", "Large parts of the geographic globe were at that point uncharted territory, a source of fear and foreboding.", "Today, large parts of the financial globe are similarly uncharted or cast in shadows.", "They too are a source of regulatory fear and foreboding.", "With financial data captured in a homogenous fashion across financial firms, the stage would be set for mapping much more comprehensively the contours of the financial world - an atlas of financial complexity to mirror Hausmann's atlas of economic complexity.", "Technologically, there is no reason why tracking the financial web should be any more complex than tracking global supply chains or the web.", "Monitoring global flows of funds, as they ebb and flow, should be possible in close to real time.", "To get a sense of the possible, consider the case of meteorology.", "It operates within a huge, interconnected global network, with cross-border information pooling.", "The logistics are eye-watering.", "Forecasting the weather involves massively large-scale data sampling of over 100 million observations per day, across hundreds of thousands of locations scattered across the globe, measured along multiple dimensions.", "The result is a very high-dimension information grid, similar in some respects to the web.", "The information embedded in this high-dimension web is then aggregated, filtered and used to forecast weather patterns in close to real time.", "These weather predictions can be telescoped to any level of geographic granularity, from the smallest town to the largest continent.", "And the forecasts are made for timelines ranging from minutes to decades ahead.", "There is no reason why, with the right data infrastructure captured in a common language, technology could not be used to map and simulate the risk contours of the global financial system.", "International regulatory authorities would play the role of the meteorologists.", "Risk warnings, like weather warnings, would form part of the regulatory toolkit.", "So too would stress-tests of the impact of extreme financial events on the functioning of the global financial web.", "(d) Lowering barriers to entry Paul Volcker famously commented that the only useful piece of technological innovation in banking over the past 30 years had been the ATM.", "What is certainly true is that some markets for banking products appear to lack contestability.", "That has meant large incumbents have often dominated the banking landscape, in much the same way as was true until recently in music and publishing.", "In banking, this lack of contestability is one root cause of the too-big-to-fail problem.", "Consistent with that, birth and death rates in banking are lower than among non-financial companies.", "They are lower even than in other areas of finance.", "Death rates among US banks have averaged around 0.2% per year over the past 70 years.", "Among hedge funds, average annual rates of attrition have been closer to 7% per year.", "Birth rates are similarly low.", "Remarkably, up until 2010 no new major bank had been set up in the UK for a century.", "If product markets and the internet are any guide, a common financial language could help lower barriers to market entry, increasing birth rates in banking.", "They might even begin to erode the too-big-to-fail problem through market forces.", "At the fringes of finance, there may already be encouraging signs of network technology reshaping some elements of banking.", "Max Levchin was not too-big-to-fail.", "Prior to founding Confinity Inc. in 1998 (with Peter Thiel), his previous three businesses had all failed.", "His new business provided a method of secure payments between Palm Pilots.", "By early 2000, however, it was clear that more people were using the website, rather than handheld devices, to make payments, in particular for purchases across auction websites.", "Confinity merged to create a new company - PayPal.", "Even as traffic across the site grew, the stage seemed set for Levchin to make it four failures in a row as two of the world's biggest banks entered the market.", "Wells Fargo and eBay together launched a new venture, Billpoint, for web-based payments.", "Citibank, too, entered the market with c2it.", "But, remarkably, PayPal saw both off.", "The key was superior fraud detection technology developed by Levchin using the information embedded in the web.", "eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion and closed Billpoint.", "Today, it processes over $300 million in payments globally each working day.", "In large parts of Africa, a different type of payments technology has also disintermediated banks - mobile phones.", "In March 2007, the Kenyan mobile phone company Safaricom launched M-Pesa, a service for making payments between phones.", "Today, it has around 15 million users reaching over 60% of Kenya's adult population.", "The model has spread to a number of countries including Bangladesh, Uganda and Nigeria.", "In response, incumbent banks have been forced to lower significantly their payment costs.", "And it is not just payments.", "Lending is the new frontier.", "Kiva is a developing world micro-finance organisation with a difference: it is based in San Francisco.", "Person-to-person financing is provided remotely using borrower information stored on Kiva's website.", "Credit assessment and tracking are done by Kiva's field partners.", "Each of these is ranked, eBay-style, using information on their historical default and delinquency rates.", "This disintermediated market has so far avoided both banana skins and lemons.", "Kiva has a 99% repayment rate.", "The model may be set to spread into advanced economies.", "Commercial peer-to-peer lending, using the web as a conduit, is an emerging business.", "For example, in the UK companies such as Zopa, Funding Circle and Crowdcube are developing this model.", "At present, these companies are tiny.", "But so, a decade and a half ago, was Google.", "If eBay can solve the lemons problem in the second-hand sales market, it can be done in the market for loans.", "With open access to borrower information, held centrally and virtually, there is no reason why end-savers and end-investors cannot connect directly.", "The banking middle men may in time become the surplus links in the chain.", "Where music and publishing have led, finance could follow.", "An information web, linked by a common language, makes that disintermediated model of finance a more realistic possibility.", "Steve Jobs described his approach to innovation as \"trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then trying to bring those things into what you are doing.", "Picasso had a saying: good artists copy, great artists steal.", "And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas\".", "Language is the original great idea.", "Akerlof, G A (1970), \"The Market for \"Lemons\": Quality
