the ECB, Mr. Papademos, at a meeting in Frankfurt, where I launched the idea to be assisted by the ECB and member banks of the ESCB on approximating our system with the European one.", "Trying to spare the time for other discussions of interest in this meeting, I would like to briefly mention some of the main steps to be undertaken by the BoA in the integration process with the European System

the Bank of Albania and of the financial system in Albania In integration process, the reviewing of laws and by-laws is of priority, particularly in the context of the prerequisites that a country

identification of our needs and priorities in this direction would serve as the first step.", "The Bank of Albania is not the sole authority in supervising the financial operations licensed in

cash.", "In the function of market development, positive tendencies are expected in the future, in terms of increasing competition and banking intermediation efficiency.", "Concerning cash reduction in economy (money outside banks), the BoA is not going to work in campaigns but will be led by a more active philosophy in terms of encouraging banking products, completion of clearing systems, use of credit cards not only for payments but also for general services and particularly for utilitarian ones.", "The identification of factors impacting on inflation and the magnitude of this impact remains an important element, thus creating possibilities for a more accurate inflation forecasting.", "An important role in this direction will be played by improvement of research and information abilities
