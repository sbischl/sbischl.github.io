last May, it had dropped to 2.4%, a level comparable to those in developed countries.", "Second, on banking supervision.", "As the central monetary authority of the country, our responsibility is to provide pro-active leadership to bring about a \"strong financial system conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy.\"", "Effective banking supervision as well as responsive policies and programs are key to this task.", "Overall, we continue to perform well in this regard.", "The banking system has been projecting overall soundness: better capitalization;

and in the annual assessment of central bank governors by Global Finance of New York, we received a rating of A minus, one of only six given an A rating.", "Nevertheless, this should not give us cause for complacency;
