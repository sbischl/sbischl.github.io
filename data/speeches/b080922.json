brought into being by Hans Tietmeyer in 1999 - brings together national financial authorities (central banks, supervisory agencies, and finance ministers) from large international financial centres as well as bodies such as standard setters and international financial institutions, giving it a unique capacity to give impetus to and facilitate coordination among these bodies.", "Our conviction is that misaligned incentives in several areas of the financial services industry weakened lending and underwriting standards, particularly but not exclusively in the United States.", "At a more general level, innovation and complexity outstripped banks' capacity to manage key risks -

it is not clear yet, in particular, how required, desired and actual capital levels will evolve over a full cycle under Basel II (although a framework is now in place for tracking and assessing this).", "As we consider how to strengthen the regime, more thought needs to be given to how to promote higher buffers above the regulatory minimum in good times, which can then be dipped into more flexibly during cyclical downturns.", "To a degree, this is already possible in a discretionary way, although too much divergence in national implementation of Basel II would raise issues of transparency and consistency in international regulatory arrangements and should therefore be constrained.", "Ad hoc, uncoordinated reductions in required minima could be viewed as forbearance and could give the wrong signal about authorities' judgement as to the overall strength of the system.", "How we can best dampen procyclicality in bank capital is an inquiry we are now engaging internationally and in the European context in a coordinated fashion.", "A related issue is sound loan-loss provisioning: these are useful tools to counter the effects of procyclicality, especially on new lending.", "However, our banking systems came into this crisis with historically low levels of provisions.", "To a degree, this can be attributed to the benign recent default environment.", "But it also reflects new accounting principles and prudential rules, the effects of which we need to assess in the light of experience.", "Our aim must be to create scope to promote more throughthe-cycle provisioning techniques that place institutions in a position to absorb losses rather than curtail credit during a downturn.", "Compensation issues - these have been much in the public eye recently: do bonusbased pay systems, for both traders and senior and top management of financial firms, reward short-term risk taking with little penalty for the longer-term risks taken to achieve profits?", "What are the elements of a sound compensation scheme?", "On this issue, the interests of regulators and shareholders broadly align but banks face a collective action problem.", "If there is a role for regulators and supervisors in this area, is it ex ante (to adjust risk taking incentives), and/or ex post (to adjust capital to the risks taken)?", "Valuation and leverage: the interplay between these has become more important over time for a number of reasons, including more marketable assets (especially credit) that need to be marked to market, more market-based collateralized funding, more leveraged position-taking.", "But here too there is more we need to know about the mechanics involved.", "What effects have valuation practices and leverage had on the cyclicality of the financial system?", "Acting through which channels?", "Is there a possible or desirable course of action for the official sector?", "Coming to the issue of monetary policy and financial stability If the market turbulence tells us anything, it is that the pace of financial innovation in recent years, the volume of transaction in certain markets, the amount of embedded leverage in the system, and the global nature of finance, have transformed the functioning of the international financial system.", "These transformations were not fully appreciated in their implications for monetary policy making.", "Central banks are inherently concerned with the health of the financial system.", "Because of the critical role it performs - that of allocating capital and risk to the economy - a wellfunctioning financial sector is key for the achievement of primary macroeconomic objectives, such as stable prices and sustained growth; for central banks, it is also fundamental for the effective transmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy.", "Contributing to the health of the financial system is, in a sense, encoded in the genes of central banks: one of the historical reasons for establishing a central bank was indeed to reinforce financial stability by having an institution that could act as a lender of last resort.", "The policy followed by the European Central Bank since the start of the turmoil is very much in line with this historical role.", "The ECB has not remained passive.", "It has used the tools at his disposal, in particular its liquidity operations, to support the smooth functioning of the money market in periods of acute stress.", "Its operational framework has proved to be robust and flexible to effectively respond to the challenge posed by the drying-up of market liquidity.", "However - and this is a crucial aspect of the ECB policy - we have operated under the principle of strict separation between the liquidity provision policy and the stance of monetary policy.", "Monetary policy, the setting of the level of interest rates by the ECB, has been directed at fulfilling its primary goal: maintaining price stability.", "Charging monetary policy with additional objectives, such as a direct responsibility for financial stability, would risk blurring responsibilities, increasing moral hazard and creating a trade-off where there is none.", "I fully agree with the remark often made by Otmar Issing that there is no lasting trade-off between price stability and financial stability.", "Even if, as he acknowledges, some short-term conflicts may occasionally arise, this can be easily accommodated by a monetary policy strategy that focuses on an appropriate medium term horizon, as the one chosen by the ECB.", "Over such horizons, price stability and financial stability are mutually reinforcing, rather than alternative, goals.", "We should not forget that some of the most damaging and prolonged periods of financial distress (such as the Great Depression, the Japanese experience in the 90's and many of the currency crises in emerging markets in the past century) have been associated with - and sometimes aggravated by - the inability to control the inflation process.", "Relying on a clear separation of roles and a correct assignment of instruments to objectives is particularly important at the current juncture, as we face inflationary pressures combined with weaker economic activity and financial turbulence.", "It is precisely in these difficult situations that the benefits of a sound monetary framework become apparent.", "Only by ensuring a return to price stability in a reasonable time frame we will be able to control inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty and risk premia, sustain longer-term financing and purchasing power and thus reinforce the prospects for real activity and financial stability.", "The risk that a prolonged period of high inflation may destabilize expectations and become entrenched in wage and price setting requires a resolute stance in monetary policy.", "It is essential that other economic actors too adopt a responsible behaviour.", "It is also quite obvious that should current financial instability aggravate and threaten to lead to a deflationary situation, monetary policy would have to take this into account.", "While the role of monetary policy in the current circumstances should be clear, it is nevertheless wise, also in this field, to draw lessons from the recent experience.", "An important one, which relates to the topic of procyclicality I just mentioned, is on the role that unusually easy global credit conditions over many years had in the build up of the current turmoil.", "There is a clear asymmetry between the two phases of boom-bust cycles.", "While the effects of the bust phase are very visible, the building-up of imbalances in the boom phase is not easily detected.", "This is because there are of course many other factors - not necessarily related to imbalances - that contribute to changes in asset prices and balance sheet positions, and not all booms end up in busts.", "Central banks are thus easily forced into a situation where they may need to intervene after the crash, injecting liquidity to avoid a financial crisis, or even at times loosening monetary policy to avoid deflation, but remain passive during the previous phase.", "The problem however is that a monetary policy that limits itself to such a passive role - the so called \"mop up after\" policy - may increase moral hazard and plant the seeds for further and more acute imbalances in the future.", "The key challenge is therefore to understand whether monetary policy can or should be more proactive and \"lean against the wind\" also in periods of growing financial imbalances in a preemptive manner, even in the absence of immediate threats to price stability.", "This is an open issue on which opinions diverge.", "I will limit myself to the following observations.", "First, risk premia in equity, housing, government bonds and corporate debt markets had reached over the past ten years - with different timing - a historical minimum.", "They had consistently declined since the mid-eighties.", "There are structural reasons behind this trend: the deepening and broadening of global financial markets; and more stable policy regimes, in particular for monetary policy, leading to lower macroeconomic volatility - and therefore risk - in the last two decades (a phenomenon also known as the Great Moderation).", "But there have also been transient, and thus less comforting, factors at work: lower volatility in the economy may have been due to \"good luck\", i.e.", "a historically unprecedented decline in the vigour of exogenous shocks.", "This may have generated a false perception of safety.", "Most importantly from the point of view of monetary authorities, protracted low interest rates at the global level may have favoured an excessive appetite for risk, reinforcing the flawed incentives in risk management that have played a pivotal role in the recent turmoil.", "Indeed, the existence of a \"risk taking\" channel - an impact of monetary policy on either risk perception or risk tolerance - appears to have some ground in both theoretical arguments and empirical research.", "Again, all this is not new.", "From a historical perspective, accomodative monetary policy has been found to be a key factor in many cycles that ended up in crises.", "The underestimation of risk is particularly worrying when it involves the housing markets, as participants are likely to be on average less informed and less protected against changing conditions than is the case in other markets.", "Protracted low interest rates associated with asset price booms - especially in housing - very low risk premia and buoyant credit growth should ring a bell to policy makers.", "Second, the thorough analysis of intermediaries' balance sheets and monetary and credit developments, which the Bundesbank has championed and is now an essential part of the ECB strategy, is crucial in this field.", "Besides supporting the assessment on the outlook for price stability, this analysis could be an indispensable ingredient of a monetary policy aiming at a higher symmetry of response to boom-bust cycles, reducing procyclicality and moral hazard in the financial sector.", "Monetary analysis may be all the more important in situations of potential financial distress when it is necessary to lengthen the horizon of policy, but it is very hard to do so by means of forecasts given the complexities involved.", "This may be even more true if we allow for the possibility put forward by some observers, that when monetary policy is highly credible, excessive liquidity expansions may find their way first in fuelling asset price and credit booms, rather than in creating inflationary pressures.", "The analysis of credit and money has also permitted us to form a balanced opinion on the effects the financial turmoil.", "While we do see a slowdown in credit growth in the euro area, this appears to be in line with the regular impact of slower economic activity and tighter policy conditions.", "Up to now, we have seen no signs of additional effects coming from financial tensions, and so far the capital position of banks overall in the euro area remains sound.", "Of course, if the crisis were to become systemic, counterparty risks could always spread all over the world.", "Third, I do not think that central banks possess a superior knowledge, relative to the private sector, to be able to judge whether a deviation from fundamentals is occurring in the pricing of any individual asset.", "Having said that, central banks - with their strong technical skills, independent judgement and system-wide, longer-term perspective - are perhaps better placed to assess systemic risks emerging from financial markets.", "This can prompt informed communication to the financial system and to the wider public and, at times, also monetary policy action.", "As it is the case in general when confronting low-probability but high-cost events, it may be optimal to choose to err on the side of caution if this helps to reduce the likelihood of future crises.", "Fourth, as recently recognized by Adrian and Shin among others, in a market based financial system, banking and capital developments have become inseparable.", "Through the impact it has on capital market conditions, monetary policy may have become more important in influencing the size of financial intermediary balance sheets.", "In this respect it could play an important role in dampening fluctuations that may lead to potential disorderly unwinding of See, among others, G.
