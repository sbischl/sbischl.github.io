rather technical and more subtle - reasons and this is my contribution to the relevant debate.", "Firstly, as we know, fiscal consolidation took place through the targeting of a nominal variable, i.e.", "the overall fiscal deficit which is cyclical.", "Taking permanent austerity measures to reduce the cyclical deficit only deepens and prolongs a recession, it results in excessive austerity and overtaxation which is self-defeating (it raises less government revenues).", "Instead, the structural deficit should be the appropriate target variable, and the cyclical deficit would correct itself through the automatic fiscal stabilisers, provided that growth-enhancing measures supplement fiscal consolidation (Mourmouras, FT, 2012).", "Secondly, there is a certain misperception in the MoUs about how reforms would work in the economy.", "I identify two grey areas here: (i) reforms take time to unlock their growth potential and their results are also country-specific.", "A recent study by the OECD (2014) indicates that the above time period may extend to five years or more; (ii) structural reforms work better and quicker when there is investment to capitalise on them and, more generally, demand in the economy because the more the recession lingers on, the harder it is to achieve positive results by implementing structural reforms.", "Such a demand element can be incorporated into an adjustment programme in monetary unions through the adoption of a broader concept of conditionality, namely that of investment conditionality, along with fiscal and structural conditionalities (Mourmouras, WSJ, 2012).", "These are important lessons to be drawn from the Greek experience, and hopefully this will be taken into account in the design and implementation of future adjustment programmes in monetary unions.", "Truly, in the last year or so, we have witnessed a revival of the Greek economy through the stabilisation of expectations and the gradual restoration of confidence.", "Looking forward now, we all agree that given the prolonged fiscal consolidation and private disinvestment that took place (2007: investment was 27% of GDP, today it is 11% of GDP, the lowest level since 1960), the country needs an investment shock.", "Reviving domestic and foreign investment is crucial to supporting the economic recovery.", "That is why it is important for the government to speed up the privatisation agenda, not so much as a revenue exercise, but as a great opportunity to attract FDI in key sectors of the economy, such as transport, energy, logistics and tourism.", "In this respect, let me come back to an old proposal of mine, as my fifth proposal today, made back in the summer of 2014, before joining the Central The Double Crisis Volume Bank (see Mourmouras, 2, Chapter 18: first of all, we should all agree on the limits of overtaxation.", "For instance, with regard to corporate taxation in Greece, 29% corporate tax (plus a 10% tax on dividends), tax competition from other countries is very intense, e.g.", "from the Iberian peninsula with an average tax rate of 20% (Spain and Portugal), the Baltic countries with an average tax rate of 15% (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) and the Balkans with an average of 10% (Turkey 20%, Romania 20%, Albania 15%, Cyprus 12.5%, Bulgaria 10% and FYROM 10%).", "Hence, there is a strong case to be made in Greece in favour of a drastic gradual reduction of corporate tax rates starting in 2020, but to be announced fairly soon, ultimately reaching a flat tax rate of 15% and remain locked at the same level for another five years.", "The drastic reduction in corporate tax rates and the commitment to leave them unchanged for a period of five years will be the best signal to Greek and foreign investors that the Greek authorities are now seeking to change the country's growth paradigm and move towards a dynamic economy based on private investment and exports.", "This drop in taxes could be financed by the fiscal space achieved through a decrease in primary surpluses, say, to 2.5% from 2020 onwards, bringing effectively forward a year or two the agreed-with-our-lenders lower primary surpluses, or from a persistent overshooting of agreed surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022.", "Much to my delight, the above proposal that links lower corporate taxes to lower primary surpluses has been adopted by the Bank of Greece in May 2016 and by the main opposition leader at DETH in Thessaloniki in September 2016.", "C.

policy reaching its limits, namely, negative rates (in 2008, the base rate was +4%, today it is negative) and the trillions bought by the ECB through its QE programme, and the scarcity issue which naturally arises, clearly, monetary policy can't be the \"only game in town\" during the next crisis.", "In that eventuality, there will be hopefully a more active role for fiscal policy with more fiscal backstops to be implemented, moving also towards more risk-sharing in the euro area.", "Many people, including myself, feel that we need to strike a balance in the classic national responsibility, or the 'new wine in the struggle between solidarity and same old bottle', namely risk-sharing (namely mutualisation of costs) versus risk reduction.", "Especially in the South of Europe, there is a strong feeling that this balance is unstable and in order to make it more stable and more symmetrical, what is needed are stronger European institutions, for instance, a full-blown Banking Union and the ESM being turned into a proper European Monetary Fund.", "It is important to bring forward the date of the establishment of the European the Banking Union's third pillar, Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which is scheduled for 2025, providing stronger and more uniform deposit insurance cover.", "Even the announcement of the entry into full operation of EDIS will have a strong confidence-building effect on depositors, in the sense of avoiding risks of selffulfilling prophecies on bank runs.", "The Jean Monnet principle is inter-temporal and applies at all times: sum of the solutions adopted to address the crises it is faced with.\"", "The European clock is ticking down and the EU must take action at the June Council in two weeks' time or at the latest at the December Summit, otherwise electorate will punish its politicians for their slow reflexes at the European elections time, leading to a generalised crisis of confidence in the European Union.", "Over its long history, Europe has traditionally managed to find consensus on the burning issues facing it, even at the very last minute.", "As a true European myself, I only hope that this time will not be different!", "Thank you very much for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
