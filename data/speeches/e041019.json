amount of $2,5 b.", "If other items associated to pensions, (classified in \"other transferences\") such as teaching funds, Fonpet and other concepts, are added to pensions payment, the total of

numbers (that are in accordance with Financial Plan of 2005), assume a lesser deficit in the public sector consolidated that would pass from 2,5% to 2,4% of the GDP between 2004 and 2005 and a deficit in payment balance drawing account that would increase from 1,8% to 3,0% of the GDP in those same years.", "According to the exercise of macroeconomic programming, a higher external saving and the fact that in public sector no resources absorption is had, this implies that private expenditures have a higher space for growing.", "The above mentioned is explained because the lower net internal credit demand by the public sector (that would pass from 1,4% to 1,0% of the GDP), would permit the private sector to dispose of higher financing resources.", "In this manner, according to programming exercise, financial system credit offer to the private sector could grow in an annual rate of 13,2%, 4,0 percent points above the nominal GDP growth (9,2%).", "These numbers show that private expenditure in consumptions and inversion would continue being the economical growth motor, compensating the reductions foreseen in public inversion and low growth of real exportations (due mainly to lower incomes from petrol exportations).", "This higher expenditure would change the net financial position of private sector against the other sectors and would become the net receiver of the resources of 2005 (equivalent to 0,5% of the GDP), for the first time in six years.", "In this period as an average, the private sector has lent resources to the economy for a 2,6% of the GDP.", "As a conclusion, 2005 Budget is coherent with macroeconomic and employment scenery in an economic activity recovery, based on higher expenditures from the private sector.", "This expenditure expansion is possible under the assumption that in 2005 the economy will have access to external capital flows that will permit the financing of a higher deficit in drawing account.", "However, if there are access restrictions to international financing markets, internal financing capacity of private and public sectors could be seriously affected and this would cause a negative impact on economic growth.", "Year 2005 debt sustainability and budget Debt sustainability depends on the generation of a primary balance required that will stabilize or reduce the in force debt (as a proportion of the GDP), given economic growth rates and a mean real rate interest (internal and external) to which the external debt must serve itself and the one contracted in the future.", "Primary balance calculations required are also affected by the evolution of the exchange rate.", "According to fiscal projections of Treasury Minister recently presented, primary balance required should be of 2,9% of the GDP for the period 2006 to 2015 (Basic scenery with an economical growth of 4,0% and a real interest rate of 6,0%).", "It should be emphasized that this primary balance would stabilize the debt, even if some negative impacts that the economy could pass through occur.", "In that manner, for example, in the worst scenery (with a growth of 0% during 2005 and 2006, and a higher rate interest), the debt would stabilize in 55,0% of the GDP in 2015.", "Regarding the above mentioned sustainability calculations, the following aspects should be 1.", "For the years 2004 and 2005 it is estimated that consolidated public sectors will generate a primary surplus of 2,7% and 3,0% of the GDP, that are coherent with a sustainable public debt.", "However, the Central Government will continue generating a primary deficit of 1,1% and 1,9% each year respectively.", "Therefore, the rest of the public sector will be in charge of compensating these important unbalances.", "If these fiscal projections are complied, there will be no sustainability problems in the public debt, due to the fact that non-financed public sector balance (SPNF) projected for these, years is close to the one required.", "However the sustainability of the public debt, in the middle term requires the generation of in a permanent manner will guarantee the maintenance of a primary surplus of 2,9% for the public sector.", "In the figures of Treasury Minister, incomes projections are based on taxes created with a transitory character with an expiration date of 2007 (this is the case for patrimony tax, incomes over taxation and the addition of one point in financial movements taxes).", "Therefore, the government will at some moment consider formulas for compensating the drop of these incomes.", "If this were not done, primary balance would diminish in the same proportion, which would cause that public debt be managed in a more complex manner in the future.", "Surplus foreseen in the non-centralized sector depends mainly of Ecopetrol's finances and the sector of Social Security.", "In the case of Ecopetrol its fiscal performance is conditioned by different types of contingencies, such as the finding of new crude oil reserves, the evolution of international crude oil prices and exchanger rate behavior.", "The fiscal deterioration of the ISS, whose pensions obligations will have to be covered in great part by budget appropriations due to the depletion of its reserves, makes it mandatory the approval of the pensions general regime reform project, as well as the elimination of special pension regime.", "It must be emphasized that these reforms will have an impact on the mean and long terms because future deficits in Social Security will be diminished.", "However, the cash flow deficit that exists requires complementary measures, not only in incomes but in expenditures as well.", "Otherwise, the fiscal situation will continue being highly vulnerable.", "It should be noticed the great negative impact that devaluation would have over public debt, whose trajectory is highly sensible to variations in the exchange rate.", "For this reason, a big part of the positive effect that a real devaluation has over net exportations may be offset with the negative impact over public debt and possibly over the confidence of the agents upon consequent deterioration of debt indicators.", "In this sense, an appreciation over real exchange rate must be accompanied with higher fiscal surpluses (or lower deficit) so that it will not have a negative impact over the economy.", "Synthesizing, in the fastest and highest grade that fiscal problem is resolved, it will be more feasible that the economy will have high economic growth, lower real interest rates and more competitive levels in real exchange rates without affecting in a negative manner public debt dynamics.", "Otherwise, primary surpluses required in the future will be higher and therefore the costs in which the society must incur to obtain them will be higher."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
