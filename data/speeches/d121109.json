it is difficult for outsiders to evaluate the quality of the assets which a bank holds and, therefore, its true financial position.", "Secondly, the potential negative externalities of bank failures are very damaging for the economy and for society, as was demonstrated vividly by the global financial crisis.", "Corporate governance in banking has certain features which distinguish it from corporate governance in non financial firms.", "This is because of the unique characteristics of banks, in particular the fact they are very heavily leveraged and that most of their liabilities are owed to a large number of atomised depositors who have the most to lose from abusive or negligent management.", "Consequently, a priority of corporate governance in banking is the protection of the interests of depositors.", "In addition, the corporate governance of banks attaches particular importance to the veracity of financial information.", "Bank failures in Uganda and the reform of bank regulation In the 1990s and early 2000s, Uganda's banking industry suffered a number of bank failures.", "Eight banks failed, forcing the Bank of Uganda (BOU) to intervene and resolve them;

a Risk Management Committee and an Asset Liability Management Committee.", "The former is responsible for the general oversight of risk management in the bank, while the latter is responsible for setting specific guidelines to manage risk, such as single loan exposure limits and loan to capital ratios.", "The guidelines set by the Board or its sub committees must, of course, be consistent with the regulations in the FIA where applicable.", "For example, the Board may approve policies which would raise the bank's capital above the minimum statutory capital requirements, but it cannot set capital requirements which are lower than the statutory minimum.", "Audit function Uganda's banking regulations emphasise the importance of the role played by independent internal and external auditors in ensuring good corporate governance, and in particular ensuring that the bank's financial statements accurately and fairly reflect the its true financial position.", "Each bank must have an internal auditor who is independent of the bank management and who reports to the audit committee of the Board.", "The duties of the internal auditor including evaluating the accuracy of financial information prepared by the bank's accounting and computer systems and monitoring management's compliance with the policies and procedures of the bank.", "Boards of Directors must use the internal and external auditors as an independent check on the information that is provided by the management of the bank.", "I want to stress that the Board of Directors must approve the audited financial statements of the bank, before they are published;
