on schedule - the full package of reform proposals.", "Comprehensive impact assessments are now underway to assess the consequences of the December capital and liquidity proposals on the banking sector.", "This is complemented by a top down assessment to calibrate the new minimum requirements, taking account of, among other things, loss experience over this crisis, and the impact on banks' role in the financial system and the benefits and costs of the new requirements in the steady state.", "As I mentioned earlier, it will be critical that we do not let current strained conditions shape the standards, but instead keep our focus on the rigorous framework needed to ensure balanced, sustainable banking in the years ahead.", "While the banking sector has already made significant progress to raise the level and quality of its capital and liquidity, immediately implementing in full the more stringent minimum requirements could have negative effects.", "We will design appropriate transition and grandfathering arrangements that rule this out.", "We have set in train jointly with the Basel Committee, and with the IMF as a key partner, a thorough macroeconomic impact assessment to inform these phase-in and implementation arrangements.", "Preliminary results on all assessment streams will be available in June/July.", "Calibration work will continue into the fall, and the broad features of the framework, along with the transition arrangements, will be ready by the G20 Summit in November.", "Countries will need to pass any necessary legislation to implement the reform according to the agreed timetable, and the EU is at the forefront of this.", "Second, this year we must agree on measures to credibly reduce the moral hazard and TBTF is first and foremost a systemic risk caused by firms that are \"too big to fail\".", "national problem -
