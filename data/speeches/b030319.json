in unemployment that is caused by a significantly higher rate of growth in labour costs in Norway compared with other countries.", "Nor can an expansionary fiscal policy counter a cost-driven rise in unemployment.", "Growth in real wages is far higher than the underlying growth in productivity.", "If higher costs cannot be passed on to customers, earnings decline and the wage share increases1.",

in the labour market improves.", "Some of the unemployed may exit the labour market on retirement schemes.", "Outflows from the labour market and low labour force growth as a result of demographic trends may limit the increase in unemployment.", "Nevertheless, unemployment is projected to rise, especially in manufacturing.", "The increase through 2002 primarily reflects a rise in unemployment in the service sector.", "Manufacturing unemployment remained stable until end-2002, but has increased substantially in the last few months.", "More lay-offs and lower expectations regarding manufacturing employment point to increased unemployment in the manufacturing sector ahead.", "In addition, statistics show a 40 per cent reduction in the number of vacancies in manufacturing advertised in the last year.", "Demand for labour, measured in terms of advertised vacancies, is also low in other industries, indicating that unemployment may also increase further in the sheltered sector in the period ahead.", "Unemployment is projected to stabilise at this level in 2005.", "There are wide regional variations in unemployment.", "At the end of February, the number of registered

regions and established links with regional research institutions in six of them.", "These institutions will hold meetings with the representatives on behalf of Norges Bank.", "Region North is covered by Kunnskapsparken in Bod\u00f8.", "Companies in the north are reporting lower demand and deteriorating profitability.", "The same tendency can be observed in most industries with the exception of retail trade and construction.", "The krone exchange rate, combined with a costly wage settlement, has contributed to weakening competitiveness in internationally exposed industries.", "As a result, demand and turnover in sectors that supply goods and services to this industry have fallen markedly.", "Retail companies have recorded growth in turnover and solid profits in recent months, and our contacts expect this situation to continue over the next months.", "Some activity growth is being reported for the construction industry.", "The increase in activity primarily reflects higher public sector demand.", "Workforce reductions in both the public sector and manufacturing industry have been reported.", "More workforce reductions and lay-offs are planned for the period ahead.", "Developments in the Norwegian economy may prove to be weaker than projected in the October Inflation Report.", "In spite of the interest rate cuts and a stimulatory central government budget, overall economic policy has been tight because the krone has been strong.", "The weakening of the krone since January has, however, led to an easing of monetary policy.", "Several years of deteriorating competitiveness will, nevertheless, have a dampening impact on growth in the period ahead.", "The business confidence survey for manufacturing industry shows that manufacturing leaders' sentiments about future developments are negative.", "Companies report a decline in production, employment and orders for both the export and domestic market.", "Many companies have moved abroad or are planning to move all or parts of their production out of Norway.", "In recent years, the shipbuilding and engineering industries have sustained the activity level in Norwegian manufacturing.", "Shipyards experienced a sharp increase in new orders before end-2000 prior to the elimination of support to the shipbuilding industry in Norway and many European countries.", "The level of new orders has since then been very low, and the order backlog is nearly exhausted.", "A sharp increase in petroleum investment could provide positive growth impulses to the offshore-related industry.", "The demand impulses from petroleum investment to the mainland economy may, however, be weaker than has been the case earlier.", "Construction and installations with a high import content will account for a large share of the increase in investment from 2002 to 2003.", "Due to the high cost level in Norway, a growing number of contracts are also being awarded to foreign companies.", "At the same time, Norwegian shipyards are increasingly using foreign subcontractors in low-cost countries.", "This is having an impact on the Norwegian engineering industry.", "Many service industries have had to adjust capacity in pace with changes in operating parameters.", "Investment in service sectors has fallen sharply, and is expected to continue to fall.", "There is considerable excess capacity in the commercial building market.", "Over the past year, there has been extensive restructuring and downscaling, especially in the ICT sector and the airline industry.", "With the prospect of continued weak developments in the global economy and an uncertain stock market, reductions in capacity may still be necessary.", "The fall in share prices reflects weaker expectations concerning future earnings.", "This may prompt enterprises to postpone or cancel investment plans.", "When share prices are low, companies may also find that raising capital by means of new issues is not an attractive alternative.", "Strong growth in private consumption has contributed to sustaining activity in the Norwegian economy.", "Sharp wage growth, combined with reductions in direct and indirect taxes, resulted in close to 5% growth in household real disposable income last year.", "Real income growth will be considerably lower in 2003 and probably lower than projected earlier.", "Imbalances in the Norwegian electricity market have resulted in a sharp increase in electricity prices.", "This implies a considerable reduction in household real income growth.", "The interest rate reductions this winter will have the opposite effect.", "In addition, developments in employment are expected to be weaker and wage growth somewhat lower this year than previously projected.", "During the last six months, households have become less optimistic about the economic outlook.", "Increased uncertainty in the labour market and lower confidence point to heightened caution and increased saving in the household sector.", "Lower interest rates have the opposite effect.", "Household saving behaviour may also be affected by high electricity prices.", "On the whole, a moderate, temporary decline in household saving is expected in 2003.", "Next year, a normalisation of electricity prices will contribute to increasing real income growth compared with 2003.", "At the same time, we have assumed that a share of the increased use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget will entail increased transfers or tax cuts for households.", "These factors, combined with lower interest rates, may fuel relatively brisk growth in private consumption in the next few years.", "In the last few months, house prices have risen at a slower pace than in previous years.", "Activity in the housing market has declined and it takes longer to sell a dwelling.", "Growth in household borrowing remains high, but has eased somewhat recently.", "Weaker developments in house prices and reduced household optimism may further restrain credit growth in the future.", "The underlying rise in prices in the coming year will be marked by the appreciation of the krone over the last two years.", "Despite high wage growth, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) will most likely range between 11\u20442 and 2% until the summer.", "Subsequent developments will partly depend on externally generated inflationary impulses, changes in the exchange rate and how these changes feed through to consumer prices in Norway.", "The sharp rise in electricity prices may also affect other consumer prices.", "Wage developments this year and next will play an important role over the next one to two years.", "The inflation projections depend on the assumptions concerning the interest rate and the exchange rate.", "In the Inflation Report, we presented two alternative paths for the Norwegian economy.", "We judged that a gradual easing of monetary policy seemed appropriate.", "In one scenario, the tight monetary policy stance was held unchanged.", "Inflation then fell below target over the next few years.", "In another scenario, monetary policy was relaxed in line with market expectations.", "Inflation then moved up and was higher than the inflation target.", "Actual developments may, however, deviate from both paths.", "Norges Bank will continuously assess developments in the global economy, the Norwegian economy and the krone exchange rate, and set the interest rate with a view to achieving the inflation target."],
