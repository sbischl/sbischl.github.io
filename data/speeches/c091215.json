small.", "These Arab thoroughbreds move fast and are bred to be quick on the turn.", "For I sometimes fear the western model of banking has an inherent kamikaze conservatism; a bit slow on its feet

advances, with scarcely a whiff of the toxic fumes that are besetting our distant neighbours.", "Thus, as you will appreciate from these brief remarks, my stewardship of the Bank has not been as negative as some recent press coverage might lead the uninformed observer to believe.", "Let me give you a few other strong positives.", "First, our management of foreign exchange reserves.", "Our net international reserves increased by nearly Rs18 billion to stand at Rs96 billion in October 2009.", "That's an increase of nearly 23% since December 2006.", "This constitutes more that 40 weeks' imports, as against 38 weeks of imports in December 2007, notwithstanding the rise in the value of imports during this period.", "Still on this topic, tiny Mauritius became the 2nd country to participate in the Fund's gold sales this year, coming hard on the heels of the South Asian Elephant, India.", "Second, the exchange rate.", "The rupee exchange rate index and which we rolled out last year, has declined steadily since May this year to close at around 98 in November 2009, compared to its base of 100 for Calendar Year 2007, thus indicating an appreciation of the rupee.", "I understand that last week Bloomberg commented that the rupee appreciated by 2% vis a\u0300 vis the dollar, in spite of our \"Theatre de Boulevard\".", "The Bank also acted as lender of last resort in foreign exchange at about this time last year when trade credit lines dried up.", "I am sure the grand daddy of central banking, Bagehot, would have approved.", "Third, banking and finance.", "The banking sector, which is the bread and butter of the Central Bank, has seen its profit surge by a full 50% since December 2006 to reach Rs 12.6 billion for the year ended 30 June 2009.", "While banks in the rest of the world are drowning in red ink, we have seen non-performing loans declining to a historical low of 2.5% in September 2009.", "Thus, there is scarcely a whiff of the toxic fumes that are besetting banking elsewhere.", "Both banking sector assets and banking deposits grew by nearly 22% between December 2006 to September 2009.", "And there is not a trace of any credit crunch as advances have increased by over 60% to stand at Rs 427 billion at the end of the period, of which nearly 40% was directed to the domestic market.", "Banks have also expanded their footprint in the country, with the number of branches going up from 177 to 202, and the number of ATM's increasing from 326 to 376 during the last three years.", "Many central banks have sent their officers to our Bank on attachment and study tours to see how we conduct business in various areas of central banking.", "This redounds to the credit of the institution, which is a small player but is known and respected.", "Of course, when I look back over the past 21\u20442 years, I do have some regrets about what might have been but did not happen.", "I realize that vision is not enough to effect organizational change to make the Bank perform at optimal level.", "I am dismayed by the resistance which I encountered when I tried to introduce what is now being termed \"dynamic provisioning\" last year to provide for future expected losses, which was then sheer anathema to the accounting profession, but which is likely to become accepted as a new standard soon.", "Thus, the Bank missed a golden opportunity to be a pace-setter in this area in the emerging world.", "Another regret is our failure as the main provider of data on banking, finance and international trade to the IMF to graduate to the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standards.", "Had other key players in the sector shared our vision, we would have ranked with Malta and Cyprus, both of which joined the league of SDDS countries last week.", "All is not lost, though, as we are working hard to join this higher reporting standard so that we can rank among the best.", "Punching above one's weight has always been a key driver for many of my actions.", "This is done more easily if the entire team shares the same mind-set and is prepared to leave their comfort zone to reach ever higher and higher.", "Hilary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, has been lavishing praise on our government as an economic and moral leader in Africa.", "The World Bank has given our economy a clean bill of health.", "The IMF is holding what it calls our \"hybrid system of inflation targeting\" as a model for other countries to emulate.", "And, for good measure, the Fund has re-classified our exchange rate regime as \"free floating\", going up one notch above \"managed floating.\"", "We do not have the vaulting ambition to aim for the next level, which is that of a reserve currency!", "To a troubled world we seem to have offered some fresh tuition.", "Yet we should beware of hubris.", "So let us be warned by H G Wells, one of the founding fathers of that fine institution, LSE - much beloved of our Minister of Finance, and my daughter - who asserted over 100 \"Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe\".", "Thus we must learn from the current troubles, shrewdly building on our evidence-based approach to business, banking and finance.", "The World Economic Forum index may put us top of the African league on probity, but we still come low on the Global list; Hilary likes our form of democracy, but the Privy Council has probed some of our political election practices and found some of our customs wanting.", "We may be getting along in economic growth; but what about the degradation of our natural environment and the effectiveness of our response to the risks of climate change and sea level rise?", "Our lodestar must be the rule of law, and not those quaint misleading dubious customs of the past.", "Let us pay due respect to our electoral laws and codes, and our banking laws and regulations, and to the safe future of our natural environment.", "It is our commitment to these duties in business, that can best protect our state and our planet earth from degradation and our people and our leaders from unwarranted calumny.", "Now, perhaps as never before, we must face the music, and press on with those reforms in our practices that will keep us resilient and on the fast track to growth with equity and justice.", "Or we will all face the fate of the dodo.", "Finally, I must observe, that a core problem with business, as with fiscal and monetary policy, is knowing whether it will be a success.", "Last time I offered you the Maradonna theory of interest rates; tonight may I close by offering you the Albert Einstein theory of success.", "I hope this will help many in business who are addicted workaholics.", "Einstein proposed a very simple formula: A= X +Y+Z, where A represents success in Life, X is work, Y is play, and Z is keeping your mouth shut.", "I can hear your silent imprecations that I pay some heed to that last Z element!", "But, before I do so, let me call upon you all, to rise and drink a toast, to a prosperous new future for banking in Mauritius, coupled firmly with the real economy and the private sector and a firm commitment in our work to face the music and dance with agility to our own Mauritian tunes."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
