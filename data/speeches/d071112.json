includes Islamic banking, takaful and Islamic money and capital markets.", "These activities are adequately supported by the legal, human capital, Shariah and regulatory infrastructure, a diversity of players and a wide range of products and services.", "To further promote the international dimension of Islamic finance in Malaysia, the Malaysian Government has also launched an initiative known as the Malaysia International Islamic Financial Centre or MIFC.", "The MIFC initiative is specifically undertaken by the collective efforts of the country's financial and market regulators, including Bank Negara Malaysia, the Securities Commission, the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) and Bursa Malaysia, together with the participation of the industry representing the banking, takaful and capital markets.", "It is aimed towards building greater intermediation linkages between the East Asian and Middle East regions which will in turn, further expand interregional trade and

Islamic Banks (IIBs), International Takaful Operators (ITOs), as well as International Currency Business Units (ICBUs) of Islamic banks and takaful operators.", "To date, 14 financial institutions have been granted approval to set up ICBUs.", "Critical areas of contribution - Malaysia's role In this last segment of my address this morning, allow me to share several key areas in Islamic finance where Malaysia can play major roles, particularly by capitalizing on various initiatives and incentives under MIFC banner.", "The first area is retakaful.", "The Malaysian Government has focused efforts towards the development of the retakaful sector in complementing the encouraging growth and expansion of the takaful industry.", "This is a critical response to the challenge of the shortage of strong and credible retakaful capacity globally which poses an impediment to the growth momentum of the takaful sector.", "Besides fulfilling the need for retakaful support from the takaful operators, and reducing the industry's dependency on conventional reinsurance support, the retakaful operators will also play key roles in enhancing the technical knowledge in the market, as well as in promoting product development and innovation in the takaful industry.", "For this, Bank Negara Malaysia has taken a strategic move to further strengthen Malaysia's edge as a retakaful hub by inviting strong and qualified applicants, both local and foreign, to make Malaysia as their platform for retakaful activities.", "A strong takaful market in Malaysia, supported by the experience and expertise of several niche players in retakaful operation during the last two decades, would provide a strong base for a global retakaful operation to flourish.", "Under this initiative, qualified local and foreign applicants will be allowed to conduct both Malaysian and international currencies retakaful business.", "Flexibility is accorded to the retakaful operators to conduct its retakaful business in Malaysia by way of an incorporated either entity or a branch.", "Foreign applicants are also welcomed to conduct retakaful business in Malaysia through a joint-venture with Malaysian companies.", "It is anticipated that this measure would serve as a catalyst in our efforts for Malaysia to become the centre for takaful and retakaful business through the establishment of a significant number of strong and reputable retakaful operators.", "For the potential investors in these ventures, I wish to highlight that Malaysia maintains a liberal foreign exchange administration regime where investors are freely able to obtain ringgit and foreign currencies to fund their investments in Malaysia.", "Please do forget the foreign exchange administration rules introduced during the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis.", "We have even further relaxed the foreign exchange administration rules to allow resident and foreign issuers to raise foreign currency-denominated bonds, including Islamic bonds or sukuks.", "Foreigners investing in Malaysia are also free to hedge with onshore banks their committed flow of funds such as the repatriation of investment proceeds, dividends and profits from Malaysia as well as the purchase of ringgit assets in Malaysia.", "There is free mobility of inward and outward movement of funds relating to both foreign direct investment and portfolio capital investments.", "The second key area that Malaysia can play a major role is sukuk issuance, origination and trading.", "The sukuk market serves as an important platform, complementing conventional bonds in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency for the mobilization and allocation of funds within national financial systems and in the international financial system.", "Significant economic growth is taking place in Asia and the Middle East following privatization and implementation of infrastructure projects.", "This opens up tremendous opportunities for government entities, multinational corporations and multinational development institutions to raise funds through the issuance of sukuks to meet their financing needs.", "The phenomenal demand for sukuks has been spurred by the high levels of surplus savings and reserves in Asia and Gulf regions coupled with a rising demand for Islamic banking instruments from a growing Muslim population in Europe.", "Apart from the issuance of a sovereign Islamic sukuk by the Government of Malaysia, and the governments of Dubai (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Pakistan, an increase in number of multilateral agencies are also issuing sukuks to finance development projects.", "These developments signify the key role of the sukuk market in facilitating the economic development process.", "Significant progress has in fact been achieved in the development of the Malaysian sukuk market, underpinned by strong collaboration among the Government, regulatory agencies, players and investors.", "By early 2007, Malaysia accounted for 67 per cent, or about twothirds, of the global outstanding sukuk amounting to about USD47 billion.", "Malaysia is important for the global sukuk market, not only because it represents the largest sukuk market in terms of outstanding size, but also in terms of number of issuance which signifies a strong edge in market vibrancy.", "Malaysia's strong performance in sukuk activities can be attributed to several key factors that may be similarly leveraged by other issuers and players participating in the Malaysian Islamic capital market.", "These are: (i) Firstly, Malaysia has the strong edge by having an efficient platform for sukuk issuance and trading activities covering the infrastructure and facilitative rules that contribute towards efficient price discovery and shorter time to market.", "The established legal, regulatory and Shariah frameworks in the Islamic financial infrastructure are key competitive advantage for Malaysia.", "These initiatives have been reinforced by the supporting financial infrastructure including the settlement and bond information systems.", "There is no restriction on the use of proceeds, ability to use international rating services, ability to hedge positions and ability to swap issuance proceeds into foreign currencies.", "Submission for foreign currency sukuks from qualified issuers with at least a single \"A-\" credit rating would be deemed approved upon proper filing of documents with the Securities Commission.", "(ii) Secondly, Malaysia also has an edge in product innovation.", "In 2006, the Malaysian market continued to embrace innovative elements with the launch of sukuk using concepts such as Mudharabah, Musyarakah and Ijarah.", "Landmark issuance such as exchangeable sukuk Musyarakah by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, marked the world's first issue of its kind, incorporating full convertibility features.", "The derivatives market has also been developed with the introduction of Islamic currency swap and Islamic profit rate swap.", "An important enabling factor for innovations is the availability of a pool of experienced talent and resources.", "In the parallel financial system existing in Malaysia, the talent and expertise for sukuk and Islamic financial activities does not derive solely from the 9,000 staff of Islamic financial institutions.", "It is also well supported by the workforce of domestic and foreign conventional financial institutions.", "Leveraging of expertise is critical in pioneering innovative products so as to ensure that the product design and structure, as well as the risk management aspects, are thoroughly addressed.", "Moving forward, several initiatives were already in place to further support the international dimension of the Malaysian sukuk market, such as tax incentives and customized forex rules.", "For example, Malaysia has further liberalized our foreign exchange administrative rules to allow multilateral financial institutions, multinational and national corporations to issue both ringgit and non-ringgit denominated instruments in our capital market.", "A number of legal and regulatory requirements have been further customized to drive down the cost of sukuk issuance.", "These measures are key MIFC measures and incentives and these include: (i) Profits and dividends received by non-resident investors from holding of RM and non RM Islamic instruments issued in Malaysia are exempted from withholding tax; (ii) A special purpose vehicle (SPV) for Islamic financing purposes via the Islamic capital market is not required to comply with the administrative procedures under the Income Tax Act 1967; (iii) A company that establishes a SPV is given a tax deduction on the issuance cost of the Islamic securities incurred by the SPV; (iv) Tax deduction on issuance cost for all Islamic securities approved by the Securities (v) Stamp duty exemption for 10 years on instruments relating to Islamic securities under the MIFC.", "Third area is outsourcing, insourcing and white labeling activities.", "Malaysia's more than two decades of experience in takaful operation and product design can be systematically structured as a complete solution to be offered to new takaful operators.", "Takaful operators in other jurisdictions may leverage on the services and experience of the Malaysian Islamic finance and takaful industry by outsourcing certain operational functions, such as product design and investment activities, thereby allowing them to focus their currently limited resources to important tasks of expanding the business.", "Strategic alliance by Malaysians can also be forged with takaful operators in other jurisdictions to provide total product solution in the form of white labeling arrangement.", "I hope more Islamic financial institutions will join over 700 shared services and outsourcing companies currently operating in Malaysia based on the country's proven political, social and economic stability, IT and physical infrastructure, deep pool of skilled work force, liberal foreign exchange rules, proficiency in languages and government continued commitment1.", "At this stage, I wish to inform that Malaysia has developed a credible, robust and effective anti money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism or AMLCFT regime.", "A group of international assessors had in early 2007 assessed Malaysia's AMLCFT regime, both at the financial and non-financial sectors as well as on the conventional and Islamic financial institutions.", "This assessment is based on the new and more robust FATF or Financial Action Task Force 40+9 Recommendations.", "So far, globally, 40 countries have been evaluated based on this new FATF Assessment Template.", "The assessment on Malaysia was ratified at the APG's (Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering) July 2007 Annual Meeting in Perth.", "The full report on the assessment on Malaysia is published in the APG's website www.apgml.org.", "The report shows that Malaysia has performed very well.", "Malaysia received only one (1) non-compliance (NC) and is among three (3) countries that have achieved zero (0) or a single NC grading.", "Malaysia is also among 3 countries that had achieved a LC (largely complied) grading with no country receiving full compliance grading on customer due diligence assessment.", "Notwithstanding this good performance, we will continue to ensure that Malaysia collaborate with the international community to stamp out the activities of money launderers, terrorist finances or other criminal elements.", "V. Conclusion In the decade to the present, Malaysia has significantly transformed our financial sector.", "The restructuring, consolidation and reform of the financial sector have strengthened the capacity, flexibility and resilience of the financial system.", "In addition, there has been substantial deepening in several segments of the financial system, including those in takaful, the sukuk market and Islamic banking.", "Malaysia has also continued to progressively liberalize its already open financial system to further enable the free flow of funds into and out of the system.", "This transformation has opened up the potential for a range of new opportunities for participation in the Islamic financial sector in Malaysia and for facilitating greater financial flows within the region and from other regions.", "In conclusion, I wish to invite the business and financial communities attending this Summit to capitalize on this event to arrange for business meetings on the sideline of this Summit.", "Please do explore potential strategic alliance opportunities in Islamic finance, especially in takaful and retakaful with your Malaysian counterparts."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["takaful", "retakaful", "Islamic finance", "sukuk", "Malaysia", "MIFC", "shariah", "islamic banking", "outsourcing", "AML/CFT"]}
