"Whilst the global financial crisis has provided Islamic finance with a unique opportunity in the international financial system, the future success of the industry moving forward, will also depend on its continuing ability to innovate more indigenous shariah-based instruments and evolve business models that strengthen the nexus of Islamic finance with the real economy.", "An essential part of the

the new and innovative Islamic financial solutions.", "While Islamic finance practitioners and scholars continue to draw from the source of fiqh muamalat to create new and innovative instruments, the

transactions is pivotal.", "There has to be court recognition and acceptance of the Islamic contracts within the common and civil law systems, with a common approach of interpreting the rights of the contracting parties based on Shariah principles, in particular for cross-border transactions.", "Malaysia has taken the approach to address this imperative via the Law Harmonisation Committee which was established in 2010.", "As part of its mandate, the Committee undertakes an objective review on the legislation and proposes the necessary amendments on existing Malaysian laws which are applicable to execute the whole chain of Islamic financial practices.", "Since its inception, the Law Harmonisation Committee has reviewed seventeen (17) laws in Malaysia and identified the areas that

ensure that the law is reflective of the nature and features of Shariah contracts and that the degree of regulation is commensurate with the level of risks that Islamic financial institutions, markets and products pose to the overall financial system.", "The greater clarity on the legal and prudential requirements underpinned by Shariah principles will enable participants of the Islamic financial system to align to their practices and expectations accordingly when undertaking Islamic financial business and transactions.", "The second imperative relates to the continuous effort to develop the key resources of the industry, by expanding and building new capabilities needed to support its growth and development.", "There is a critical need to upskill the leadership and technical competency

require both openness on the grounds for the rulings and in-depth research on the basis of such grounds.", "A recent study conducted by the International Shariah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA) on fatwas of Shariah boards in the Asian region and the GCC countries reveals that, contrary to the popular perception, there are more similarities than differences in Shariah resolutions between the two regions.", "The study by ISRA however further indicates that there is a lack of awareness on the Shariah justifications to most of the resolutions being reviewed.", "This awareness is essential to pave the way towards greater understanding and nurturing of mutual respect.", "Whilst there are some initiatives to enhance the greater awareness on the juristic reasoning in Islamic finance, to facilitate greater mutual recognition, it will require greater transparency in the Shariah rulings in addition to constructive dialogue on the grounds of such rulings.", "With the efforts of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) and the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAIOFI), it has facilitated greater cross-border engagement among practitioners and Shariah scholars.", "In turn this has contributed to a greater understanding on issues and challenges faced by the industry and the progressive convergence of Shariah views and rulings.", "More such international collaborative work and engagement would further facilitate this harmonization process.", "To navigate amidst turbulent seas to arrive at the new frontier of opportunities in Islamic finance, there is a need for the industry to build on its strengths and achievements thus far, in the pursuit to realize the distinctive value
