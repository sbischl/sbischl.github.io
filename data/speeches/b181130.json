that was also humiliating, and above all left our people financially worse off.", "Although devaluation provides short-term benefits linked to the fall in export prices, in the medium term these are potentially outweighed by the negative effects, which we have tended to forget: inflation caused by higher import prices, a fall in the value of the country's wealth and an increase in its external debt.", "Italian creativity, your commercial ingenuity, dating back to Venice, Genoa and Florence, all count much more than the ease of a weak lira.", "/ The second reason is the economic results.", "For the past 20 years, Italy and France have reaped substantial benefits from the single currency: price stability [slide], in other words a contained level of inflation that preserves household purchasing power.", "Before the euro, inflation sometimes reached very high levels in Europe: it averaged 8.1% in Italy in the 20 years before the euro, compared with 1.8% in the last 20 years.", "stable financing conditions, due to a marked reduction in interest rates and a narrowing of spreads between countries [slide].", "The spread between Italy and Germany, for example, has more than halved: it averaged 5.1% over 1986-92 - a period when we had a single market without a single currency, between the Single European Act that followed the Milan European Council, and Maastricht - compared with 1.9% in 2017-18, even though it has widened again recently due to the re-emergence of uncertainties.", "Assuming, then, that one of our countries were to go back to pre-euro times - a scenario I see as very unlikely - there would be a heavy price to pay in terms of the financing of public debt, as well as household and corporate debt.", "For Italy, it would ultimately mean an increase of more than EUR 70 billion a year in the government's debt servicing cost, which is more than the country's total education budget.", "Our citizens are therefore strongly attached to the single currency: today, 61% of Italians and 70% of French people support the euro.", "And it is this broad-spread, popular support that is one of the euro's greatest achievements.", "/ The last two reasons relate to the very nature of the unique system that unites the 19 euro area countries: monetary policy is shared;

and all have proved compatible with the social model we all share and support.", "Both our countries have persistent weaknesses, especially in the labour market, with an unemployment rate that is too high.", "But the weakness we most share is our lag in training and education.", "Around a quarter of adults in Italy and France have poor reading comprehension skills, and the results of the PISA survey are no better.", "In total, nearly a quarter of 18 to 24 yearolds in Italy and 19% in France are NEETS (Not in Employment, Education or Training) - well above the OECD average of 14%.", "Therefore, we have no greater priority today than developing skills, apprenticeships and professional training.", "As well as this need for the right reforms in our two countries, the decentralisation of the euro area has another consequence: we need a more symmetrical adjustment, with wage increases and fiscal stimulus in those countries that have the room to manoeuvre, such as Germany and the Netherlands.", "Fortunately, this process has already begun, with the fiscal plans set out by the coalition governments elected in 2017, and the pick-up in wage growth as these countries get nearer to full employment.", "The excessive external surpluses in the euro area are also a sign of poor resource allocation.", "The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure carried out by the European Commission must therefore be symmetrical.", "To construct a more solidarity-based euro area, we need an Italy that is committed.", "At the same time, the euro area also needs to be improved: although Monetary Union is a success, the weaknesses of the Economic Union continue to pose a problem.", "We need to find a \"tightrope\" that combines Since Meseberg last June, France and responsibility and solidarity.", "Germany have put forward some initial proposals.", "I know that the subject is a sensitive one in Italy... but I would like to say this as a friend: you should agree to examine and discuss the substance of these proposals, before worrying about the very principle of Franco-German discussions, which are often necessary but never sufficient.", "Rest assured, we very much want Italy to join us at the negotiating table, and you will, I think, find it in your interest to increase public and private solidarity.", "/ The first priority is to Our starting point here should be the real increase private risk-sharing.", "needs of the economy, and especially those of firms and entrepreneurs.", "In order to invest and innovate, for example in the digital economy or the energy transition, firms must to be able to take greater risks.", "This means more equity financing, which has a longer-term horizon, as opposed to debt financing.", "The euro area is already lagging far behind in this respect: equity financing was equivalent to just 77% of GDP in France in mid-2018, compared with 124% in the United States.", "And yet we have abundant resources: a savings surplus of around EUR 350 billion in the euro area.", "[slide] We therefore need to build a \"Financing Union for Investment and Innovation\" in order to channel these resources to where they are needed.", "This Union would be a combination of two existing initiatives, first of all the Banking Union, which must at last be finalised.", "The priority now is to complete the \"second pillar\" - the resolution of failing banks - with the establishment of a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.", "This should go hand in hand with a sufficient reduction in risks; however, we should not allow ourselves to be held back by layers of rigid quantitative criteria.", "It is also vital that we remove the obstacles to sound cross-border consolidations, which would allow banks to move savings more freely across borders.", "But this financing union must also build on the Capital Markets Union.", "There is a political consensus for this, but we now have to make concrete progress on revising bankruptcy laws and strengthening ESMA.", "In addition to private risk-sharing, there is also a vital need for a common public solidarity [slide].", "One aspect of this is the reinforcement of the mechanism European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in particular its precautionary tools: credible crisis prevention means not just ensuring fiscal discipline, but also having the necessary tools in place to help Member States cushion asymmetric shocks, which can appear suddenly despite all efforts to avoid them.", "To be efficient, precautionary tools should, in my view, be based on objective and simple ex ante criteria [such as abiding by certain rules], rather than on the current burdensome conditionality system which is too similar to an assistance programme.", "The euro area budget proposed by France could also play a stabilising role, by supporting investment, especially in education and training, and of course in new technologies, when national finances are constrained.", "Discussions over the ESM have raised another issue, which I know is a sensitive topic in Italy: the France also believes that we need to tread carefully here.", "restructuring of sovereign debt.", "We should avoid adopting a mechanical approach, because when rules are automatic, market expectations can trigger sudden chain reactions and pose a threat to financial stability.", "On the other hand, it might be useful to hold technical discussions on ways of implementing collective action clauses (CAC).", "I would like to conclude by quoting President Luigi Einaudi, who wrote this in 1954: \"In the life of nations, the mistake of not seizing the moment is usually irreparable.", "The need to unify Europe is evident.", "[...] This is not a problem of choice between independence or union, but of choice between existing in unity or disappearing.\"", "In a world marked by growing uncertainties - many of which, unfortunately, also stem from the United States - the need to preserve and reinforce the unity of Europe is stronger than ever.", "This does not mean ignoring the problems, but rather working together, as French and Italians, to achieve what we want: a more efficient and solidarity-based Europe.", "Thank you for your attention.", "A macro-micro narrative of Italian exports\", Banca d'Italia Working Paper No.", "Standard Eurobarometer 89, Spring 2018.", "Banca d'Italia, Financial Stability Report No.", "Results of the OECD's PIAAC survey.", "\"Sul tempo della ratifica della CED\" 1 March 1954 in Einaudi, Lo scrittorio del Presidente (1948-1955), Giulio Einaudi Editore, Torino, 1956."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Euro", "Italy", "Economic growth", "Monetary policy", "Fiscal policy", "Public debt", "Education", "Training", "Risk-sharing", "Solidarity"]}
