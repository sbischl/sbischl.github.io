and a significant increase of central clearing in OTC markets.", "CCPs in this period functioned as intended.", "Very significant and sudden changes in asset prices did not lead to counterparty credit risk - actual or anticipated.", "There were no major clearing member defaults during the pandemic, so clearing was not tested to the limit.", "But there was no panic about counterparty credit risk, no ructions in the interest rate swap markets.", "UK CCPs were able to provide clearing services without disruption.", "However, the episode highlighted a feature of the reformed system: in periods of stress, losses are realised faster.", "Market participants are forced to post sufficient collateral that reflects the market volatility promptly.", "This is key to addressing the build-up of counterparty credit risk that had been at the root of the devastating global financial crisis.", "But it also meant that some market participants faced a liquidity crunch and a different type of panic as investors scrambled to get their hands on cash (and particularly U.S. dollars).", "Margin calls in aggregate were large over the stress period.", "Initial and variation margin increased significantly, with the increase in initial margin (IM) at major global CCPs totalling around $300billion in March 2020 and the increase in variation margin (VM) flows peaking at $140billion during the height of the stress in mid-March.", "Central banks had to step in to restore market stability in a big way.", "Over the course of 2020, G10 central bank balance sheets rose by $8 trillion.", "Had central banks not acted, the financial stability consequences could have been severe.", "The first quarter of 2022 saw another episode of unprecedented volatility across financial markets as Russia invaded its neighbour.", "Once again, we saw shocks, this time in some commodity and energy markets.", "Again, we saw big margin calls at CCPs.", "Losses (and corresponding gains) on derivative positions spiked across February and March 2022, primarily in markets experiencing the largest shocks.", "The margin exchanged to reflect those losses and gains (VM) across UK CCPs in Q1 2022 were larger than those observed during the 2020 Covid crisis.", "UK CCPs' aggregate initial margin requirements also increased, but by relatively less than we saw during Q1 2020.", "This was partially because the shocks to asset prices were less broad- based, and partially because commodity markets had gone through a period of volatility just a few months earlier, so initial margin was already elevated.", "Some early lessons Just because central clearing has been a success, does not mean that CCPs and CCP regulators do not need to keep learning.", "CCPs have been central to making the financial system safer over the past decade.", "But we have also seen new significant strains that need to be addressed.", "Policy makers and market participants have deliberately and sensibly put CCPs in the centre of the financial system.", "To continue to earn that trusted role we need to keep learning - we cannot be defensive.", "I see three areas for further work (1) Tackle the side effects without sacrificing the cure By design, post-crisis reforms mean that in events of market turmoil losses are crystalized promptly and risk is repriced.", "But as we have seen in 2020 and again in 2022 this can mean very sharp strains on liquidity in parts of the system.", "The answer here is obviously not to return to pre-2008.", "We need to avoid having such short memories that we return to a pre-Lehman system.", "Instead, just as CCPs were part of the solution when it came to counterparty credit risk, they can play a role in helping to solve the liquidity risk we have seen recur in each recent episode of stress.", "In particular, CCPs can: ensure that IM is sufficiently conservative in good times that it reduces the need for wild swings once a crisis hits; and ensure that participants have sufficient information, data, and tools to anticipate what margin calls might look like under stress, and how pro-cyclical they may be.", "Importantly, tackling the side effects will also require addressing participants' preparedness to meet stress margin calls.", "While CCPs can play a part in the solution, this is not something CCPs can solve on their own.", "We also need to take a hard look at the ability of non-banks to insure against severe but plausible liquidity stress.", "The international work to look at these issues[8] is welcome - it offers opportunities to address them in a way that preserves and enhances the role of CCPs.", "If done right, it can help to address the lessons of the COVID and Russian invasion market turmoil, while ensuring that market participants have incentives to centrally clear their derivatives trades in good and bad times.", "(2) The past is not always a good guide to the future Markets, especially those for physical commodities, can behave in unexpected ways.", "Let me give you just a few examples.", "In April 2020, as the global economy was still reckoning with the many consequences of prolonged lockdowns, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil future contracts close to their expiry date went from positive to negative - people were willing to pay for you to take oil off their hands.", "Last year, in February 2021, the Great Texas Freeze hit as a result of several severe winter storms;

dealing with situations in which history is not a good guide to the future; and understanding the structural factors that can lead to big price moves.", "Addressing the issues we have seen in March 2020 and again in 2022 is both urgent and important.", "Cooperation will give us a strong foundation on which to enhance the crucial role CCPs play in supporting global financial stability as we address vulnerabilities that have become evident in recent stress.", "I am grateful to Sarah Crowley, Chandima Wijerathna, Dan Wright, Don Payagala, Michael Wood, Pavel Chichkanov and Shriya Mrug for their help in preparing these remarks.", "I am also grateful to Jon Cunliffe, Andrew Hauser, David Bailey, Nathanael Benjamin, Sarah Breeden, Andrea Rosen, Imane Bakkar, Martin Arrowsmith, Simon Morley, Justin Jacobs, Barry King and Jaynika Patel for their helpful comments.", "The FTSE All-Share index fell over 10% on 12 March, the largest one-day fall since 1987.", "Other markets also saw shocks beyond or close to the largest in history.", "FSB (2017) Report on effectiveness of derivatives reforms .", "Review of margining practices (bis.org) 5.", "From Lender of Last Resort to Market Maker of Last Resort via the dash for cash: why central banks need new tools for dealing with market dysfunction (bankofengland.co.uk) 6.", "VM calls were six times larger compared to normal levels on 1 March 2022 (\u00a334billion), compared to a five-fold increase on 18 March 2020 (\u00a329billion).", "VM calls at the most affected clearing services were as high as 35 times normal levels (LME Base).", "Total IM requirements of UK CCPs peaked at around 30% higher relative to their pre-stress levels in Q1 2020.", "Review of margining practices (bis.org) 9.", "Joint statement from UK Financial Regulation Authorities on London Metal Exchange and LME Clear | Bank of 10.", "This is different to climate change, where it is possible to model how the future will be different to the past and this is informing the pricing of risk today - but there is no obvious way to identify future market shocks and volatility robustly.", "Ignoring Population Structure Can Lead to Erroneous Predictions of Future Population Size | Learn Science at Scitable (nature.com) 12.", "Joint statement from UK Financial Regulation Authorities on London Metal Exchange and LME Clear | Bank of 13.", "Principles for financial market infrastructures (bis.org) 14.", "Bank of England - Consultation Paper - The Bank of England's approach to tiering incoming central counterparties under EMIR Article 25"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["central clearing", "market volatility", "liquidity risk", "margin calls", "CCP resilience", "structural factors", "cross-border regulation", "implausible events", "financial stability", "derivative markets"]}
