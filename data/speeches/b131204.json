Capital Conservation Buffer, all of which must be CET1.", "In other words, ladies and gentlemen, what has changed is the composition of capital to improve its loss absorbing capacity.", "I have been asked why we appear to be in a hurry to implement Basel 3.", "It's true we are ahead of the Basel timeframe of 2019, but we are actually behind our EMEAP counterparts.", "(Australia and NZ have implemented in full in 2013.)", "Are we being stricter than other jurisdictions?", "Not really, when you consider that our minimum CAR remains at 10 pct.", "I am also asked what's the benefit of implementing this now instead of later.", "1) To reduce regulatory uncertainty, 2) Minimal impact on banks, because banks are ready, 3) It's a credit positive.", "In addition, we are gearing up for

"Clearly, ladies and gentlemen, the BSP has its eyes on the ball and its ears to the ground.", "Importantly, we have policy space to respond to the brewing pressures we observe.", "Often times, however, it is in the perception of the brewing pressures where the BSP and the market could have a conceptual difference.", "Let me just cite three risks that we see as possible points of pressure: 1) What comes after the Fed Action (or No Action)? )", "Liquidity and Credit Growth post IMA - Are there inflationary and financial Stability concerns? )", "Should we be concerned with the Rest of the World?", "Risk 1: How prepared are we for a Fed Tapering?", "The Fed taper is an issue that is quite familiar to the market.", "And I am sure you have read with critical interest all the analyses by eminent Fed watchers of the recent Fed pronouncements.", "I don't want to stir that pot of confusion and I also don't want to comment on what the Fed should or shouldn't have done.", "But one thing I know is clear, and I can attest to this: the BSP is ready to respond to \"excessive\" market exuberance or disappointment (whichever case will apply) to any surprise action (or the lack thereof) of the Fed.", "I know I don't need to remind you, that we are watching market conduct very carefully, closely, and critically.", "Should market reaction/sentiment lead to a loss of overall business confidence or a disanchoring of inflation expectations, the BSP has the room to adjust policy interest rates or other monetary policy tools, as appropriate.", "Should market action lead to instability in the non-financial (or the real asset) markets, we can further tweak existing macroprudential measures or release new ones, as appropriate to target problem asset areas.", "In other words, ladies and gentlemen, our policy actions will always be guided by our price and financial stability objectives.", "Barring any unforeseen threats, I think we have room to keep policy rates steady for the balance of the year.", "Risk 2: Should domestic liquidity growth be a concern?", "And the flip-side of this, should we be concerned with credit growth?", "Our assessment is that both liquidity and credit are rising consistent with the growth in the economy and financial deepening.", "Strong liquidity and credit growth feeds the economy's growth potential.", "Structural reform milestones that began in the early 1990s and 2000s and continue to gather stronger pace today have translated to productivity gains over time, as reflected in higher potential output growth.", "If the current investment-led growth and institutional reforms are sustained, a 5 to 7 percent potential output growth for the medium-term is highly feasible.", "There is sufficient liquidity to fuel this, and banks are able to intermediate these funds safely.", "You could also ask should the market be concerned post-SDA IMA?", "If the market concern is on the headline liquidity growth number of over 30 percent, my answer would be no.", "The BSP has always anticipated there will be some liquidity growth after the funds under SDA- IMA are \"released\".", "That was, after all, the game plan.", "We fine-tuned the SDA operations so the funds could find more productive homes in industry, manufacturing and other sectors of the economy.", "In addition, our anticipation is that the period of high liquidity growth coming from SDA-IMA will not persist.", "If the concern is whether the liquidity will fuel an asset bubble, the answer again is no.", "And I think you, who know your SDA clients well, will agree with me on this one.", "The profile of an SDA investor is very different from the profile of a real estate investor.", "Finally, Risk 3: The Rest of the World?", "Because of 1) trade ties with, 2) workers deployed to, and 3) tourists expected from Europe, Japan, China, we watch these countries with great interest.", "At the moment, the consensus seems to be that 1) Europe can possibly keep its growth rate level, 2) Japan will calibrate its stimulus, learning from the experience of the Fed on the problems of exit from unconventional monetary policy, and 3) China will continue to grow at a steadier pace.", "We are monitoring these economies, but we are also mindful that our own domestic demand conditions, particularly consumption and capital formation, remain quite strong.", "Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, I've laid out for you the \"facts\" and the \"perceived risks\" - three buffers against three vulnerabilities.", "I know I've gone thru a lot of information.", "I am not worried though because I know dealers are experts at multi-tasking, and are able to filter thru a lot of information quickly!", "My bottom line is this: the country has what it takes to move forward amidst the uncertainty in the short-term, because we have put up buffers.", "I know you have heard this said over and over and over but ladies and gentlemen, this is not a trivial matter.", "It is the very presence of these buffers that has enabled you to enjoy the positions that you are currently in.", "We are where we are because we did our homework.", "To you, the vital players in the market, my message is - Do NOT get stuck in the short-term.", "Just because we have the buffers, doesn't mean it should be \"business as usual\" You should always look to enlarge your business opportunities, and not just go for the quick trade.", "I encourage you to think \"long-term\".", "I know LONG-TERM TRADER (unless natatalo yung position) is an oxymoron.", "But think about it, to survive in this business, you NEED to think long-term.", "The BSP has a full market reform agenda.", "The agenda, as you will learn quickly enough, is not a mechanical duplication of the international reforms.", "Our agenda is a calibrated adoption of the principles of the international agenda to suit our idiosyncratic requirements as an economy.", "It is also informed by lessons learned from years of dealing with earlier crises.", "The BSP needs you, the market, to partner with us, in the full development of this agenda, and in its eventual implementation.", "Reform will work only if we work on it together.", "I avoided using \"ink blots\" at the beginning of my remarks.", "But I think for my conclusion, I shall put one up.", "This picture is the word \"CRISIS\", written in Chinese.", "It is said that one character represents danger, the other opportunity.", "I am not an expert, but I don't think the Chinese meant to say that \"Opportunity plus Danger equals Crisis\".", "Although to an undisciplined trader, working in a dealing room without the appropriate controls, he might see an \"OPPORTUNITY\" which could then bring \"DANGER \"to the firm, and result in CRISIS.", "As a true market, we don't ever want to find ourselves in a \"FIX\" like this.", "The BSP is always ready to sanction such activities to the full extent of regulations and the law.", "But I digress, what I hope we all will come away with from this picture is this: that with every crisis comes an opportunity to grow.", "In the Philippines, we can achieve that if we look beyond the short-term volatilities, and consider the bigger picture of what lies ahead.", "I hope I can count on all of you, as we work from the same page, of the same game plan.", "Thank you, and have a pleasant evening."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
