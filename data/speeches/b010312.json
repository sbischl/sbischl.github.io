even though the federal budget was first consolidated and then generated a growing surplus, investment exceeded aggregate saving.", "Investment was still able to reach record levels because the additional capital could be borrowed from investors abroad who willingly placed their money in U.S. securities in the expectation that the good times would continue.", "That explains why the U.S. current account has been able to run up a gigantic deficit, currently equivalent to almost 5 per cent of GDP, at the same time as the dollar has appreciated strongly.", "Even with rapidly rising productivity, the rate of economic growth became incompatible with long-term stability.", "In order to dampen activity, the Federal Reserve started to apply the brakes in summer 1999, raising the instrumental rate in a series of steps, totalling 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 per cent.", "The setbacks were not long in coming.", "Last year the value of the Nasdaq exchange was virtually halved.", "Profit warnings have been pouring in, firms are shedding labour, banks have tightened their lending, consumer confidence is weakening and unemployment is tending to rise.", "Manufacturing output has virtually stopped growing.", "In the course of a month the Federal Reserve has lowered the interest rate 1 percentage point to 5.5 per cent and market agents are counting on further cuts this spring.", "We now have to consider what is actually happening.", "Is this just a temporary correction after a period of undue optimism that has led, for example, to surplus investment and will now be followed by a fairly mild and gradual slowdown?", "Or has the major long-term and painful correction of the imbalances in the U.S. economy now begun in earnest?", "After some months of unpredictable data, even the most experienced and qualified observers find it difficult to say anything definite.", "So let me outline three conceivable paths - one optimistic, another less so, a third pessimistic - and then discuss them.", "The optimistic scenario - the V The alternative most observers, particularly in the United States, believe in just now is that the fall in the United States is an unpleasant but innocuous 'air pocket' in the flight path of the American economy's soft-landing to lower growth rates.", "The air pocket is attributed to a temporary output surplus, so that unduly large stocks and rather too much IT investment have to be adjusted downwards during one or, at most, two quarters.", "The profile of this development is commonly described as a capital V; consumption and investment slacken initially and then pick up again, bringing growth back up to its presumed potential rate of around 3 to 4 per cent.", "Underlying this version is the recent years' exceptional technology-driven improvement in productivity, which helps to inject new life into the optimistic mood.", "The concern generated by the correction is brushed away by the active monetary policy and the promise of massive tax cuts in the coming years.", "The optimists set great store by IT's impact on growth and productivity, as well as by a quick improvement in expected profits.", "The less optimistic scenario - the U Some observers see a risk of the upturn occurring more slowly than the V scenario assumes.", "They see a path that instead resembles a capital U, with a downturn that is more protracted.", "Investment has been a strong factor behind the upward phase in recent years and proponents of the U scenario consider the economy has been hit by excessive investment, so that an unduly large capital stock must now be adjusted.", "This adjustment is accentuating the economic slowdown, making this more difficult to counter than seemed likely earlier.", "It will take time - perhaps a long time - for the interest rate cuts to have an effect on demand from households and firms.", "Moreover, the conditions for a quick recovery have been worsened by the imbalances that have accumulated in the economy.", "This scenario envisages that the U.S. labour market is still so overheated that if IT prices fall while commodity prices rise, at the same time as a weaker dollar adds to the cost of imports, then inflation will move up even though growth is weak.", "The Federal Reserve might have more difficulty in handling this scenario because if inflation is threatening to rise, the interest rate would be less available for turning activity upwards.", "There is also the possibility of the promised tax cuts taking time to materialise, which would be liable to postpone a recovery.", "Instead of the slowdown turning upwards after one or, at most, two quarters in the V scenario, this would take another two quarters or a total of about a year.", "The pessimistic scenario - the L Then there are one or perhaps several pessimistic scenarios in which the imbalances in the U.S. economy undergo a painful correction that paralyses the economy or delays the recovery for a very long time.", "This path can be described as a capital L; the economy loses speed and then fails to get going again, proceeding instead at a snail's pace.", "One assumption behind scenarios of this kind is that measures of economic policy are not capable of reversing the trend.", "In the L scenario, the higher productivity growth is checked, corporate investment is cut back and consumer confidence is muted by falling share prices, thereby accentuating the downward path.", "In a negative spiral, share prices, investment and consumption all decline at the same time as worried investors abroad become averse to placing their funds in the U.S. economy.", "The problems are accentuated by the saving imbalances.", "When money ceases to flow into the United States, the dollar falls.", "The relatively limited size of foreign trade means that a correction of the massive current-account deficit takes time.", "The United States has to invest less and save more.", "Moreover, the debt position of households and firms now seems to be more tangible and perhaps more troublesome.", "The debt levels were possibly motivated earlier, when productivity, expected profits and wealth were continuously improving, but now that wealth stocks have collapsed, this is more difficult.", "There is a risk that instead of investing, firms use every cent they can find to strengthen solvency.", "A similar risk is that heavily mortgaged households will not be prepared to take advantage of lower interest rates.", "It is also conceivable that if activity slackens more than expected, the federal finances will not develop as favourably as many people believe at present.", "That could deliver another blow to confidence in the future.", "Which of these scenarios seems most probable is debatable.", "But they are not mutually exclusive.", "The outcome may well consist of features from more than one of them.", "What looks at first like a V, for example, can change into an L.
