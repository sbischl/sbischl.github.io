exchange rates and employment levels.", "Interest rate adjustments influence inflation.", "Rising interest rates reduces consumption and Investment thereby dampening aggregate demand.", "A low

payments, employment levels, and a broad range of other economic data which helps us to create an index of economic activity.", "The desire to take account of real sector issues in the monetary policy process results in the construction of a Composite Index of Economic Activity which estimates the upswings or downswings in economic activity.", "This Index incorporates indicators such as

the Bank of Ghana does not focus exclusively on price stability.", "Some of your members may be aware that we conduct bi-monthly business surveys on some 45 companies in all sectors of the economy,

a cycle of declining interest rates.", "Looking ahead, Mr. Chairman, the Central Bank anticipates a much stronger rebound in economic activities in 2010.", "The objective of monetary policy is to foster growth by encouraging further declines in interest rates as inflation declines and inflation expectations diminish.", "This will set the stage for the private sector to access credit at relatively cheaper costs to pursue productive ventures while the Central Bank works to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability requisite for economic growth.", "As we move towards an era of low and stable inflationary environment, access to credit for productive activities will improve and businesses must begin to map out strategies to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs in order to stay competitive.", "I will encourage the incoming executives of the AGI to promote strategies that will ensure that our local industries stay competitive especially as the Ghanaian economy continues to integrate into the global economy.", "To conclude, let me state that the primary objective of the Central Bank is to pursue sound monetary and financial policies aimed at price stability
