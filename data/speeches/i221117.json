Italian Banking Association Rome, 16 November 2022 The EU economy[ is highly dependent on fossil fuels[ ], which represent close to three-quarters of its total energy consumption.", "Most of this fossil fuel energy is imported: while the EU accounts for 8 per cent of global fossil fuel demand, it accounts for only 0.5 per cent of global oil production and 1 per cent of global gas production.", "A major cost of this dependence - which we are reminded of daily - is that energy-producing countries can use their fossil fuel exports to pressure or even threaten energy importers, creating geopolitical tension in the process.", "Historically, the price of crude oil has often spiked in the context of war, as is the case today.", "This underlines the need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.", "Another huge cost of our reliance on fossil fuels is climate change.", "The earth is warming rapidly, with massive risks to ecosystems and humans, and urgent action is needed to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and shift to green sources of energy.", "[ At the global level, energy generated from oil, coal and natural gas makes up more than 80 per cent of primary energy consumption.", "According to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), this share will have to be reduced to around 30 per cent to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.", "For the EU, the reduction will have to be even greater.", "[ This will require wide-ranging structural changes in energy production, but we still have a long way to go (Chart 1).", "[ The energy mix needs to change

warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.", "The average of the three main models used by the NGFS is displayed.", "The definitions for the EU differ across these three models.", "These changes will have profound implications for our daily lives and economic system.", "The price of energy affects the cost of virtually everything we consume and produce.", "As a result, the costpush shock from an increase in energy prices is felt throughout the economy.", "Given that the ECB's primary mandate is to preserve price stability, understanding the relationship between the transition to a greener economy and the price of energy is crucial.", "To start with, let me be clear: we cannot blame today's high oil and gas prices on the green transition.", "The culprit is clearly Russia's manipulation of the energy supply[ ], which has resulted in higher and more volatile energy prices in an already tight market.", "[ Reduced supply has exacerbated the effects of the strong post-pandemic recovery in fossil fuel demand, resulting in the high energy prices we are seeing today.", "[ But the massive shift required by the green transition may matter for energy prices in the future.", "In this respect, the argument is often made that the green transition will cause a persistent rise in energy commodity prices and inflation.", "[ However, the price effects of the green transition are not straightforward.", "In fact, the green transition will influence several dimensions which will in turn affect energy prices.", "For example, it will modify both the demand and supply of fossil fuels through multiple channels, with ambiguous effects on market prices along the transition path.", "It will also affect the cost and availability of renewable energies, which also influence the substitution away from fossil fuels and therefore their cost.", "Today I will examine the possible implications of the green transition for energy prices.", "I will argue that the pathway to a greener economy does not necessarily imply persistently higher inflation.", "Much will depend on the policies we adopt to transit away from the most polluting sources of energy.", "I would even argue that we can reach a \"divine coincidence\" between price stability and decarbonisation.", "The effects of changes in the supply and demand for fossil fuels and The green transition will affect the price of fossil fuels and other sources of energy, particularly renewables.", "Together, these dynamics will determine how overall energy prices evolve in the future.", "Taxation will play an important role.", "Lower taxation (or subsidisation) of green energy and higher taxation (or penalisation) of fossil fuels will have an impact on relative prices and demand.", "The net effect on consumer energy prices will depend on the balance between the two and how the proceeds from carbon taxation are used (whether, for instance, they are used to subsidise green energy and invest in green technologies).", "Ultimately, the impact on energy inflation will depend on how energy supply and demand react to these price signals.", "The effects of the green transition on fossil fuel prices Let me start by outlining the channels through which the green transition might affect energy commodities.", "A wide range of interacting channels will determine how the transition risks will affect energy commodity markets (Chart 2).", "[ Transmission channels: impact of the green transition on fossil fuel prices Sources: ECB staff illustrations.", "The price effect of the relative cost channel is unclear a priori as the price before tax might decline due to lower relative demand for fossil fuels, but the after-tax price might be higher.", "On the supply side, a transmission channel that is often referred to is the \"policy uncertainty channel\": expected demand makes future payoffs highly uncertain and compresses investment in fossil fuels.", "As investment declines, fossil fuel prices rise.", "Yet there are other supply forces at work that might lower prices.", "Supply may increase if fossil fuel producers extract their reserves now due to the \"frontloading channel\".", "[ Also, innovations in fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage solutions, might support investment through the \"brown innovation channel\".", "[ This would cause fossil fuel prices to fall.", "First, preferences can shift towards greener forms of energy via the \"preference channel\".", "For example, sales of electric cars in Europe now account for 14 per cent of the market, after an increase of 160 per cent in only two years.", "[ Second, policy measures can further discourage demand for fossil fuels by making these costlier than their green counterparts through the \"relative cost channel\".", "Carbon pricing is a case in point.", "[ By increasing the after-tax cost of fossil fuel and electricity produced by burning fossil fuel, carbon taxation (or equivalent measures, such as the Emissions Trading System) reduces fossil fuel demand and increases the recourse to renewables.", "The price effect is unclear a priori: the price before tax of fossil energy might decline, but the after-tax price might be higher.", "Third, innovation in green technologies could make cleaner sources of energy more available and affordable, thereby lowering demand for more polluting sources via the \"green innovation channel\".", "[ The massive increase in the installation of heat pumps in Europe in the last two years to replace gas boilers is a clear example of how new technologies can rapidly decrease fossil fuel demand.", "[ The bottom line is that the effect of the green transition on fossil fuel prices is ambiguous.", "It will depend on which channels prevail, which is largely determined by technological developments and the policies implemented by governments globally.", "Different channels might have opposite effects and dominate at different points in time.", "Renewables and the effects of the green transition on overall energy prices The effect of the green transition on overall energy prices will also crucially depend on the availability and price of renewable energy.", "The costs associated with renewables have been decreasing.", "They are now lower than those of fossil fuels.", "In 2020, new utility scale photovoltaic and onshore wind power plants were cheaper than new fossil fuel plants.", "In 2021, onshore wind costs fell by 15 per cent compared with 2020, while offshore wind and solar photovoltaic costs fell by 13 per cent.", "As of 2022, the marginal cost of new solar energy production was estimated to be a quarter of the marginal cost of existing gas plants in Europe.", "[ And in the current energy crisis, wholesale electricity prices have been lower when EU power generation relied more on renewable energy than on gas.", "[ Not only, therefore, is a reallocation of production and consumption from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy necessary to reach the net-zero emission target.", "But the lower cost of renewable energy can also put downward pressure on overall energy prices.", "In fact, the EU has decided to cushion the impact of the electricity price spike on households and businesses by imposing a temporary revenue cap on producers with lower marginal costs[ ], which mainly comprise renewable and nuclear energy producers.", "Expanding renewable energy production would increase the European economy's resilience to fossil fuel price spikes and supply disruptions.", "While renewable energies also have some drawbacks, such as the intermittence of their supply and the commodity inputs required during the plant construction phase[ ], they do not use any more commodities during the lifetime of an installation.", "[ What should we expect amid all the uncertainty?", "To assess the effects of the green transition on energy prices in the future, international bodies such as the NGFS and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have turned to scenario analysis.", "I will refer to two contrasting scenarios.", "The first is an orderly scenario which assumes ambitious climate policies are introduced immediately.", "This scenario limits global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching global net-zero emissions by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement.", "[ It nevertheless requires ambitious policy action and technological change across all sectors of the economy.", "[ The NGFS does not provide detailed and granular information on the overall cost of energy production (including from renewable energy sources), which would give a more complete picture.", "But it does provide estimates for the price of oil, gas and coal, which would only increase moderately over the next decade under the net-zero scenario (Chart 3).", "[ In particular, oil prices are predicted to increase by around 6 per cent cumulatively from 2020 to 2030, reflecting increasing costs of extraction.", "[ Gas prices, in turn, are expected to increase faster as gas demand is expected to remain relatively strong, although in annual terms the magnitudes are also contained.", "[ In a similar scenario constructed by the IEA, prices for fossil fuel (except gas) would even decline, as channels that reduce demand dominate price dynamics.", "[ Projected fossil fuel pre-tax price changes by 2030 under different scenarios Sources: Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), International Energy Agency (IEA).", "Notes: Projected changes from 2020 to 2030 of fossil fuel prices before tax.", "The net-zero scenario is an ambitious one which limits global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.", "The nationally determined contributions (NDC) is a less ambitious scenario used by NGFS which includes all pledged climate policies leading to about 2.5 \u00b0C of global warming.", "The stated policies scenario (STEPS) is used as the IEA scenario which is closest to the NDC scenario.", "For the NGFS scenarios, the average of the three main models is displayed.", "By contrast, the second NGFS scenario, referred to as \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs), assumes that only currently pledged climate change policies are implemented.", "This means that global efforts would be insufficient to halt significant global warming.", "Emissions would decline but lead nonetheless to at least 2.6 \u00b0C of warming associated with severe physical risks, setting the world on a \"hothouse\" path and failing to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.", "[ In this case, the NGFS foresees moderate increases in fossil fuel prices, while the IEA projects energy prices to increase more strongly in a similar scenario.", "This is because the demand for gas and oil is set to rise over the short run, and investment in renewables will fall short.", "These results should be taken with a pinch of salt.", "In fact, the NGFS scenarios do not yet fully incorporate the current gas market turbulence.", "Consequently, the actual change in prices may differ from the projected paths, at least in the short term.", "[ Moreover, the range of possible outcomes is extremely wide, reflecting different assumptions regarding policies, consumer preferences, technological innovation, market developments and other aspects.", "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) emphasises that the inflationary effects of the green transition depend crucially on the policies adopted during the transition.", "Although there are scenarios in which the transition can generate mild inflationary pressures, the IMF foresees that a transition aimed at cutting emissions by 25 per cent between now and 2030[ and where one-third of the revenue generated from higher carbon prices would go towards green subsidies would not lead to any material increase in inflation in the euro area compared with the baseline.", "[ Its analysis concludes that the transition to clean energy need not be inflationary and that delaying the transition would only cause costs to rise.", "Overall, these analyses confirm that the effects of the green transition on energy prices are not one-sided.", "The transition should not necessarily lead to skyrocketing energy costs in the future - it may well have the opposite effect.", "The consequences crucially depend on the interaction between the different channels driving the green transition and on policy action.", "For instance, significant investment in research and innovation is required in the short term to develop technological solutions and ensure that decarbonisation objectives can actually be met.", "If the transition happens at the required pace and is supported by the right policies, upward price pressures are likely to be contained.", "And when comparing the present value of the benefits from lower emissions with the present value of the costs of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy, there are actually considerable net benefits.", "[ Limited role for green factors in the current energy price shock Let me now turn to the current energy shock.", "After months of continual increases, the price of oil and gas reached multi-year highs in the summer.", "This raised the question of whether the green transition had played a role in these increases.", "To answer it, I will rely on empirical studies[ ], building on the vast range of literature available on the drivers of oil prices.", "[ Recent analyses suggest that the green transition has affected fossil fuel investment to a limited extent.", "Expectations about the transition may have led to lower investment in the oil sector over the last few years, probably because it has made it more expensive to attract capital.", "[ The estimated impact of a shock similar in size to the Paris Agreement on oil investment is nevertheless negligible - between one and two per cent - and increases only moderately over a longer period (Chart 4, panel A).", "[ Transition risk has not left a noticeable mark on oil prices so far (Chart 4, panel B).", "This is consistent with what I said earlier.", "Different transmission channels are at play: fossil fuel investment may have been reduced due to policy uncertainty and lower demand for these types of fuels, but these supply and demand channels have opposite effects on prices.", "The net impact on prices may therefore have been contained or even cancelled out.", "Effect of green transition on oil prices Sources: ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: Panel A: effects of a change in the ratio of green transition news articles to overall published articles in leading newspapers using a local projection framework checking for identified oil supply and demand shocks.", "The shock is scaled to the coverage in newspaper articles as observed during the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) meeting in Paris in December 2015, and the number of international oil drilling facilities is used as a proxy for oil investment.", "Panels B and C: impulse responses and forecast error variance decomposition are obtained from a monthly oil BVAR model in which a transition risk shock is identified in addition to oil demand, oil specific demand and oil supply shocks using sign and narrative restrictions.", "In panel B, the impulse responses are scaled to a shock similar in size to the one observed during the COP21 meeting in Paris.", "The sample period runs from October 2013 to January 2022.", "The results suggest that more \"conventional\" shocks to oil demand and supply have probably been the dominant drivers of oil prices up until now (Chart 4, panel C).", "This is also true for the high oil prices we see today: these are a result of the post-pandemic recovery in oil demand and shortages on the supply side driven by reasons other than climate change, such as managed oil production.", "[ For gas prices in Europe, supply disruptions are even greater.", "There are signs that even before invading Ukraine, Russia manipulated the gas supply to the European market, cutting gas flows and creating scarcity and uncertainty about future supplies.", "There was already less Russian gas flowing to Europe in 2021 despite higher gas prices and robust demand (Chart 5).", "The reduction in supply depleted European storage facilities even though there was the potential to export more.", "After the invasion of Ukraine, Russian gas flows through major pipelines such as Nord Stream 1 were further reduced and eventually halted altogether, causing European gas prices to surge even higher.", "Cuts in Russian gas supplies to the EU (in millions of cubic metres per day) Sources: Bloomberg and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: LNG includes deliveries from Russia.", "The latest observation is for 24 October 2022.", "The economic, inflationary and political tensions caused by this supply strategy probably had twin aims: break Europe's unity and weaken its support for sanctions in view of Russia's (planned) invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.", "These aims were not achieved.", "Instead, large shocks like this one should reinforce the EU's determination to speed up the green transition - rather than slow it down - and to rapidly eliminate its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.", "[ The considerable progress made on energy intensity after the oil shocks in the early 1970s gives us cause to be optimistic that similar progress can be achieved in response to the current shock.", "[ Policy implications: seeking a divine coincidence To achieve a \"divine coincidence\" whereby reducing the dependence on fossil fuels does not come at the expense of higher energy prices, public policies will need to succeed in reducing energy intensity, protecting energy security and financing the transition.", "First, policies will need to provide incentives to lower fossil fuel demand for a given after-tax price.", "[ This would limit upward pressures on energy prices during the green transition, and - importantly - would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "In the EU, the Fit for 55 package and the REPowerEU plan have raised targets for energy efficiency and include concrete measures to achieve them.", "In the short term, EU ministers have agreed on voluntary and mandatory reductions in electricity demand in response to the current crisis.", "[ Second, policies need to protect energy security to contain the likelihood of significant shocks to inflation linked to spikes in the price of fossil fuels.", "This is best coordinated or delivered at European level as national measures to secure energy supplies and shelter businesses from the impact of price increases could turn into beggar-thy-neighbour policies.", "Recent EU initiatives are moving in the right direction.", "For example, the EU Council has agreed to collect solidarity payments from fossil fuel companies to support households and businesses.", "The European Commission has proposed joint gas purchases to strengthen the EU's bargaining power when securing supplies for all Member States.", "It has also proposed solidarity rules in the event of gas shortages and is working on a revision of its State aid framework.", "Lastly, ministers have agreed that fiscal support to cushion the impact of higher energy prices should be targeted at the most vulnerable households and firms while preserving price signals and incentives to reduce fossil fuel consumption.", "Third, policies need to support the necessary investments in the green transition.", "According to the IEA, investment in renewable energy needs to triple by the end of the decade to effectively tackle climate change and contain energy prices.", "[ For the EU, reducing dependence on Russian fossil fuels and climate targets will require investing an estimated \u20ac500 billion per year between 2021 and 2030.", "Bridging the gap in green investment will require the contribution of the private sector.", "Incentives can be offered through regulatory efforts.", "For example, streamlining administrative approval processes can help accelerate renewable energy projects.", "In the area of sustainable finance, progress in adopting climate disclosures can significantly contribute towards lowering the cost of capital for green investments.", "[ The private sector will nevertheless need time to adjust.", "It may also not invest enough in green projects that have the characteristic of public goods.", "We thus need to accelerate, sustain and provide a backstop for the green transition through public investments.", "As I have previously argued, these investments would be financed more effectively and efficiently at European level than by individual Member States.", "[ They could, for example, take the form of an EU climate and energy security fund aimed at supporting the green transition in future years.", "The green transition is often presented as a threat to fundamental aspects of our daily lives, including growth opportunities or purchasing power.", "This negative narrative is unjustified.", "The divine coincidence is not a pipe dream: greener can mean cheaper.", "This depends crucially on the policies we adopt.", "If properly managed, the global response to the climate crisis can increase productivity and growth through several channels: by improving the allocation of resources, enhancing health conditions and stimulating technological progress.", "[ Under these conditions, we can place \"...climate action at the heart of a new growth story, powered by investment, technology, policy and finance\".", "[ Similarly, the green transition need not lead to higher inflation.", "In fact, appropriate public policies that compress the demand for fossil fuels and stimulate the production of cheaper renewable energy sources can help to contain inflationary pressures and may even help to reduce inflation compared with a counterfactual situation that does not contain these policies.", "In reality, we are already using the lower cost of renewable energy to cushion the impact of the fossil fuel shock on electricity prices.", "The high levels of energy inflation currently being observed cannot be blamed on the green transition.", "They are mainly the result of fossil fuel supply manipulation by Russia.", "If the green transition had happened earlier, it would have been easier to progress towards our climate goals and we would have reduced our exposure to the current energy shock and its inflationary consequences.", "The European economy would have been more resilient to the ongoing energy crisis.", "In order to act on climate change, policymakers need to take swift, bold and ambitious measures that garner the support of citizens.", "This result can only be obtained by establishing a realistic and positive narrative on the green transition.", "[ In particular, we need to reassure citizens that, under well-designed policies, the green transition would increase - not decrease - their job opportunities,

this narrative and taking policy action, a European approach is in our collective interest.", "Common policies are more likely to deliver the necessary reduction in energy intensity, protect our

financing and a general reluctance to commit large amounts of capital limit the responsiveness of fossil fuel investment to higher prices.", "See the IEA's \" World Energy Investment 2022 \" report for more details.", "There is mixed evidence on the effect of the green transition on fossil fuel investment.", "While the IEA argues that net zero pledges so far have not been correlated with fossil fuel spending (see the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2022 ), the IMF has found a significant impact of the green transition on investment of oil and gas companies, although the impact following the Paris Agreement is still less important than the effect from lower oil prices in the same period (see the IMF's World Economic Outlook 2022 ).", "In response to the pandemic, OPEC+ lowered production to support oil prices and after gradually restoring the oil supply to pre-pandemic levels, cut it again more recently.", "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has aggravated supply shortages.", "While in the short term European countries have sought to make up for the loss of Russian gas with other fossil fuels, such as coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG), the energy shock is also a major accelerator for plans to reduce energy intensity and increase the share of renewables in Europe.", "Plans to increase energy efficiency and the share of renewables have been adopted by the private sector: cutting energy costs has become a priority for businesses and households, while higher electricity prices mean that it is faster to break even on investments in power plants that do not rely on fossil fuels.", "Similar plans have also been adopted by the public sector: the European Commission's REPowerEU plan has been designed in response to the war in order to speed up the green transition and reduce EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels.", "Oil consumption as a share of the total energy mix fell by almost 12 per cent in the EU27 and 7 per cent globally in the 10 years following the 1973 oil shock (see BP Statistical Review of World Energy and Our World in Data for more information).", "This objective could be achieved for example by facilitating the emergence of mobility solutions and improvements in the built environment that make it possible to save energy and reduce carbon emissions over the life cycle of means of transport and buildings.", "Preliminary analysis by the European Commission shows that in August and September EU gas consumption would be around 15 per cent lower than the average of the previous five years.", "This figure rises to over \u20ac1.2 trillion
