The current state of Japan's economy One year and two months have passed since the introduction of QQE.", "So far, QQE has been having the intended effects.", "Surveys on various economic entities and indicators such as break-even inflation rates observed in the government bond market suggest that Japan's inflation expectations have been rising on the whole (Chart 3).", "As for nominal interest rates, yields on Japanese government bonds have been hovering stably at low levels.", "Against such accommodative financial conditions, Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately accompanied by a virtuous cycle among production, income, and spending (Chart 4).", "Regarding prices, for example, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has moved from negative territory to 1.5 percent as of April, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike (Chart 5).", "Therefore, Japan's economy looks to be on course toward achieving the 2 percent price stability target, and we feel that developments under our policy are promising.", "The relationship between monetary policy and the government's growth So, what is the relationship between the Bank of Japan's monetary policy and the growth potential of Japan's economy (Chart 6)?", "The Japanese government has been pursuing a three-pronged strategy that comprises bold monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and a growth strategy that aims to spur private investment.", "These policies are often referred to as the three arrows of Abenomics.", "The role of monetary policy in this policy mix, in an immediate sense, boils down to overcoming deflation.", "However, it is also linked to Japan's potential growth rate.", "The relationship between the two can be summarized as follows.", "The first role of monetary policy in this context, needless to say, is to stimulate aggregate demand through large-scale monetary easing, fill the output gap, and thereby bring Japan's economy back to its potential growth path; in other words, to break the vicious cycle between deflation and recession by overcoming deflation.", "During the process of the output gap diminishing as a result of QQE, Japan's potential growth rate is likely to rise to some extent.", "The reason is that workers will be able to work more efficiently, and capital investment will increase and technological innovation advance as firms, reflecting the improved business sentiment, become more willing to take risks.", "However, raising the growth potential further is not the role of the central bank and its monetary policy, but of the government and policy measures it can take, such as deregulation.", "Therefore, the second role of monetary policy is to prepare, by overcoming deflation, the environment necessary for the government to pursue economic structural reforms through its growth strategy to shift the potential growth path upward.", "Unless the economy is more or less in good shape, the government cannot promote structural reforms to enhance the efficiency and dynamism of the economy to raise productivity.", "The reason is that in a deflationary recession there will be strong resistance to the pain that pro-competition policy measures through deregulation might bring.", "You will have heard of the term creative destruction.", "When deflation continues, destruction will not be followed by creation.", "If structural reforms under the growth strategy make progress, these reforms are basically supply-side measures that increase the aggregate supply capacity of Japan's economy.", "Such increases in supply capacity could result in generating deflationary pressure unless they are accompanied by corresponding increases in aggregate demand.", "Therefore, to mitigate any deflationary pressure stemming from structural reforms, support through appropriate monetary easing is indispensable.", "Future challenges While the Japanese government aims at achieving 2 percent growth in real GDP, if the growth strategy stalls and strengthening of the growth potential does not move ahead, achievement of the price stability target could lead to a low real growth rate with mild inflation.", "Of course, overcoming protracted deflation itself is a great achievement, but in terms of revitalizing Japan's economy, it will not be enough.", "The Bank strongly hopes the government will further enhance its growth strategy in order to strengthen Japan's growth potential.", "On the other hand, if the potential growth rate rises as a result of structural reforms under the growth strategy, the output gap might temporarily worsen, leading to downward pressure on prices.", "However, since the Bank, based on the aim of achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, will continue with QQE as long as necessary to ensure price changes remain in line with the target in a stable manner, such downward pressure on prices can be staved off.", "We at the Bank are optimistic that Japan will be able to achieve higher economic growth with a stable inflation rate of about 2 percent before long, and will continue to pursue our policy of QQE to that end.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none"], "topics": ["Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing", "Inflation Expectations", "Growth Potential", "Deflation", "Output Gap", "Price Stability Target", "Growth Strategy", "Monetary Policy", "Economic Recovery", "Structural Reforms"]}
