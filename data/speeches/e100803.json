less than 5% of the overall market.", "This is surely less than the hedging needs of our economy.", "The lack of competition in providing hedging instruments among banks sometimes also implies that even the simple instruments such as forwards are overpriced, discouraging businesses from using them more often.", "And this is the challenge for the National Bank of Serbia too.", "We are committed to provide for a greater use of FX forward and derivative product both in the interbank market as well as by the corporate sector.", "The recently introduced FX swap operations of the NBS are an example.", "We will also work with the banks in standardizing their offer of forward contracts to the clients.", "Our aim is that every bank offers such a standardized product so that the prices can easily be compared.", "We will set up a call center advising businesses on such products, provide a simple calculator of forward prices on our website and conduct other promotional and educational activities.", "Besides, we will be actively encouraging banks' account managers to develop and offer hedging strategies tailored to the needs of their clients.", "A greater use of hedging instruments will have many benefits.", "With most of the foreign currency needs covered by hedging instruments, companies will be able to construct their financial plans irrespective of currency movements.", "Higher demand for such instruments from businesses will stimulate more competition and lower prices among banks.", "And a greater use of forward instruments among banks will also reduce exchange rate volatility in the interbank market.", "But most importantly, by promoting the use of FX hedging instruments the NBS is hoping to contribute to a situation when businesses and households are no longer scared of the exchange rate fluctuations.", "Situation when prices are quoted in dinars and not in euros.", "Admittedly, it is a far reaching ambition, but expanding the use of financial hedging is the first important step."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none"], "topics": ["Exchange rate", "Hedging", "Inflation", "Financial derivatives", "Currency fluctuations", "Forward contracts", "NBS", "Eurozone", "Dinar depreciation", "Mortgage"]}
