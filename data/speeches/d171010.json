second, backward-looking wage bargaining, which means that low past inflation is feeding through to wages today.", "The influence of these two causes should nevertheless diminish with the recovery in economic growth and inflation.", "Structurally, many studies suggest that the Phillips curve, that is the relationship between inflation and fluctuations in economic activity or unemployment, appears to have flattened since the 1980s [slide].", "Inflation seems less responsive to changes in economic activity in advanced countries, notably because of globalisation,iv which appears to exert downward pressure on inflation via the decline in imported goods prices and competition from low- wage countries.", "But a flatter Phillips curve does not call into question this relationship: we are in no doubt about the way we are heading: the recovery and job creations will lead to higher wages and, ultimately, more inflation.", "But we remain, nevertheless, less certain as to the of this adjustment.", "We are both confident about the effectiveness of our monetary policy and willing to be patient regarding the time it will take.", "The prospects: an adequate reduction of asset purchases, within an overall substantially accommodative monetary policy Let me now turn to the implications of this for our monetary policy.", "You are well aware that we at the ECB's Governing Council will decide this autumn the re-calibration of our policy instruments beyond the end of the year and, quote Mario Draghi, \"probably the bulk of these decisions will be taken in October\".", "We are now faced with a simple requirement, in line with our mandate to maintain price stability, and the progress towards our inflation target: we have to reduce the intensity of our net asset purchases, while maintaining overall a substantially accommodative monetary policy.", "As regards our asset purchases, we have to reduce their intensity in a pragmatic manner, as we already decided successfully in December 2016. because, while keeping the current rules - we shouldn't change any of the parameters, including the issuer and issue limits -, we can on the one hand exploit the margins of flexibility of the programme and we must on the other hand hold in reserve an additional purchasing capacity if needed.", "So, there is no reason to be worried by the prospect of an adequate reduction of our net purchases, which would be perfectly compatible with maintaining a substantial degree of monetary accommodation.", "QE is not limited to net asset purchases, and monetary policy is not limited to QE.", "Our monetary policy is based on a set of instruments [slide]: it is not a solo, but a quartet.", "On top of QE, we perform with our policy interest rates, our forward guidance and the provision of liquidity to financial institutions.", "/ On QE, the academic literature provides consistent evidence that the impact of asset purchase programmes on the yield curve and asset prices is primarily driven by the total of assets held by the central bank (the so called effect\"), rather than by the flow of transactions conducted over a given period [slide].", "Banque de France studies of the effects of the PSPP find that holding a stock of bonds equivalent to 10% of GDP lowers the 10-year yield by about 45 bps in the euro-area.v These results imply that our current programme lowers the 10-year euro-area government bond yield by about 100 bps.", "These estimates are of similar magnitude to results obtained for evaluations of the programmes conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom.vi In any case, the Eurosystem will remain a major buyer of euro-denominated bonds over the coming years, thanks to our reinvestment commitment, which we took in December 2015 and which was perhaps not widely enough noticed: the repayments that we will obtain when bonds reach their maturity date will be fully reinvested, thus keeping the size of our asset holdings unchanged and at a high level.", "In addition, the maturity of such reinvestments can be calibrated, if need be, to support the duration that we will extract from the market.", "This implies that we will continue to exert downward pressure on the yield curve by keeping our stock of asset holdings at a high level for a prolonged period of time, and we could specify it in our communication.", "/ Perhaps the most unconventional policy tool is the use of negative interest rates.", "Negative interest rates have their limitations; I have already stressed And at our Governing Council's meeting in Tallinn last June, them in the past.vii we clarified these limitations in our forward guidance stating that we do not intend to lower our deposit facility rate below its current level of -0.40%.", "But slightly negative interest rates have their virtues.", "First, by removing the zero lower bound constraint on expectations of future short-term interest rates, they contribute to easing financial conditions by lowering rates along the curve, with a positive impact on the demand for credit by firms.", "Second, the negative deposit facility rate (DFR) positively interacts with asset purchases.", "Indeed, the portfolio rebalancing effect of QE is reinforced by the negative DFR, as banks with excess liquidity holdings have a stronger incentive to put their reserves to work.", "And, so far, we have not seen significantly detrimental effects of negative rates on the profitability of banks, notably thanks to the favourable fact that the slope of the yield curve has remained positive.", "/ Our forward guidance provides further indications as to the future path of our monetary policy; and by steering expectations, it has an impact on the clear as to the sequencing: \"we expect yield curve.", "Our forward guidance is [the key ECB interest rates] to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.\"", "no doubt within the Governing Council about this sequencing.", "In all events, we should not consider raising interest rates until we have reached a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.", "/ The fourth instrument is the provision of liquidity to financial institutions.", "In October 2008, we introduced the fixed-rate full allotment policy in all our regular refinancing operations.", "The maturity of this liquidity provision was then extended with the launch of 3-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and, later, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).", "In September 2017, a total of EUR 760 billion is still lent to euro area banks through TLTROs, which at over 7% of euro area GDP is substantial.", "Supplementing monetary policy in Europe For the future, we can be confident, because our monetary policy is effective and recovery is robust.", "But our confidence must be without complacency, because monetary policy cannot be the only game in town: it must be supplemented by national reforms, and by a strengthening of the euro area.", "We have been saying this for a long time, but now is the time to act.", "where stepping up reforms is a priority, with Now is the time to act in France, a focus on two main areas: on the one hand, sustainably consolidating our public finances, and on the other, aiming to achieve an overall transformation, with and a major simplification effort in both labour market and the goods and services market, and large-scale investment in education, vocational training and apprenticeships.", "Even though we must pursue this course, this is what the new government appears to be doing with the labour market reform underway since this summer, and efforts to bring the government deficit down to 2.6% in the 2018 budget, well below the threshold of 3% of GDP for the first time in 11 years.", "Now is the time to act in Europe, above all.", "We cannot both overburden monetary policy our German friends are right in this respect and refuse Economic Union which is the prerequisite for a sounder Monetary Union.", "So we must not let ourselves be slowed down by sterile debates or false of implementing a \"transfer suspicions: there is no question union\", which would only benefit certain countries; we must not get bogged down by considerations about methods either, between intergovernmental and community methods.", "It is now urgent to make concrete progress on substance, and to move up a gear, by triggering four accelerators of the - the French President, Mr. Macron, in his speech A macro accelerator: about Europe ten days ago at the Sorbonne, started by talking about the \"coordination of policies\".", "In this widely-discussed speech, I believe that this was not sufficiently remarked upon.", "In my opinion as an independent central banker we should aim to achieve a genuine collective economic strategy; a mutual commitment between the Member States of the euro area, for more reforms in countries where they are required, and more fiscal support in countries with leeway for this.", "This collective strategy could be prepared and adopted as of 2018.", "It could be supplemented by the creation of a common stabilisation fund, aimed at supporting, through lending, Member States facing asymmetric shocks.", "This could be part of a European Monetary Fund, provided that its scope of action is extended beyond the current European Stability Mechanism.", "- A micro accelerator: i.e.", "a Financing Union for Investment and Innovation.", "The aim is to mobilise the EUR 350 billion savings surplus of the euro area, notably to shore up equity which is the key to an innovation economy, and also to foster synergies, thanks to an integrated steering mechanism, between the Juncker investment Plan, the Capital Markets Union and Banking Union.", "Here too, progress could be rapid.", "- A fiscal accelerator, once we have increased trust between Member States and made headway towards greater economic convergence: the euro area budget could be used to finance, for the benefit of all countries, \"European common goods\" such as certain digital technology, energy transition, security, migration controls.", "- An institutional accelerator: i.e.", "first and foremost a euro area Finance Minister, President of the Eurogroup and member of the Commission, backed by a European Treasury; but also a euro area Parliament group, in order to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the institutions and decisions.", "The latter two accelerators, fiscal and institutional, would require Treaty changes, unless they were to be very limited.", "But this must not stop us from making progress straightway on the first two, in order to breathe new life into Economic Union.", "I would like to conclude my speech today by quoting Stefan Zweig, one of the most famous Austrian authors.", "He wrote a beautiful text after his visit to the Banque de France in Paris in 1932.viii But he above all paid tribute to his home town in the following \"For the genius of Vienna a specifically musical one was always that it harmonized all the national and lingual contrasts.", "Its culture was a synthesis of all Western cultures.", "Whoever lived there and worked there felt himself free of all confinement and prejudice.", "\"ix I admire this Viennese spirit, which combines audacity and liberty, and which was the cradle of the greatest minds of our contemporary era.", "Today, as Europe's may be here again, I hope that this spirit will continue to inspire us.", "Thank you for your attention.", "I would like to thank P.
