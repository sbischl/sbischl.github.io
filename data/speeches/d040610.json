tightening of monetary policy.", "The krone depreciated again in December, however, owing to low inflation figures and a reduction in interest rates.", "The interest rate reduction was probably of considerable importance as it eliminated the excess return on NOK investments.", "The krone has again appreciated since last winter.", "Parallels can be drawn with the situation towards the end of 2002.", "The current high oil prices and expectations that oil prices will remain high for a long period may have been important for the appreciation of the krone.", "When there is considerable

fluctuations in the krone exchange rate as a result of petroleum revenues.", "An increase in petroleum revenues will normally also result in higher capital outflow from the Petroleum Fund.", "The market may at times have a tendency to underestimate this stabilisation mechanism.", "If oil prices develop through the rest of 2004 in line with current forward prices, and the other assumptions in the Revised National Budget for 2004 for calculating allocations to the Petroleum Fund for 2004 prove to be correct, purchases of foreign currency for the Petroleum Fund may be resumed this year.",

oil prices mean higher revenues for the oil companies.", "International and Norwegian oil companies with activities in Norway increase their capital outflow when profits increase.", "Thus, in the short and medium term, cumulative profits in the petroleum sector generate little added capital in the domestic economy.", "If petroleum revenues are disregarded, Norway has a current account deficit.", "The deficit has been increasing in recent months, and this may also, in isolation, boost demand for foreign exchange in the Norwegian foreign exchange market.", "The krone appreciation has probably been affected by shifts in themes in the international foreign exchange markets, due in part to an upward adjustment of interest rate expectations in the US in April.", "In addition, financial market expectations of higher interest rate increases in Norway in 2005 and 2006 relative to other countries have probably contributed.", "A self-reinforcing mechanism may have been functioning for a short period after the krone began to rise in value at the beginning of March this year.", "Interest rate developments abroad may have a considerable influence on movements in the krone exchange rate.", "The inflation outlook in Norway implies that Norway will not be the frontrunner when other countries increase interest rates.", "As mentioned earlier, themes shift in foreign exchange markets.", "Norges Bank does not have the instruments for fine-tuning the exchange rate.", "Normally, Norges Bank will not intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to influence the exchange rate.", "Foreign exchange market intervention, irrespective of whether foreign exchange is bought or sold, is not an appropriate instrument for influencing the krone over a longer period.", "We do not wish to act in a way that may trigger a game situation in the foreign exchange market.", "Foreign exchange intervention rather than a change in the interest rate may give ambiguous signals to foreign exchange operators and a game situation may arise.", "However, interventions may be appropriate if the krone deviates substantially from the level that the Bank judges to be reasonable in relation to fundamentals, and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target.", "Interventions may also be appropriate in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level.", "Although the krone may fluctuate in the short term, when inflation is low and stable, the exchange rate will generally stabilise over time.", "When inflation has been higher in Norway than among our trading partners for a longer period, the krone has generally depreciated.", "When inflation in Norway is expected to be broadly in line with that of other countries, the exchange rate will usually also return to its normal range following periods when the krone has been particularly strong or particularly weak.", "The advantage of a flexible exchange rate is perhaps most evident when the economy is sluggish.", "If the krone were to remain at a level that is too strong, nominal wages would have to remain unchanged over a longer period or fall in order to bolster companies and jobs.", "This only occurs when unemployment is very high.", "With a flexible exchange rate, a depreciation of the krone can also boost competitiveness.", "A flexible exchange rate can reduce fluctuations in employment and output.", "Empirical studies2 have also suggested that economic growth in industrialised countries with floating exchange rates has been as strong as, and often stronger than, growth in countries with a stable exchange rate.", "A precondition is that there is an economic policy framework so that inflation does not spin out of control.", "The real exchange rate The chart shows developments in two measures of the real krone exchange rate, i.e.", "consumer prices and relative labour costs in Norway relative to trading partners, measured in a common currency.", "The real exchange rate measured by relative labour costs in a common currency is an expression of the cost competitiveness of Norwegian companies.", "The real krone exchange rate as measured in terms of developments in relative prices is an expression of the Norwegian krone's purchasing power.", "When the curves in the chart are above zero, the exchange rate is stronger and competitiveness weaker than the average level since 1970.", "The real exchange rate has fluctuated considerably over time and has deviated substantially from the average level over longer periods.", "Nevertheless, there has been a tendency for the real exchange rate to revert to this level.", "In the chart, the point for 2004 shows the real exchange rate with wage and inflation projections for 2004 from Inflation Report 1/2004.", "In relative prices, the real exchange rate is now about 2 per cent weaker than the average since 1970, whereas it is almost 4 per cent stronger than its historical average measured in terms of relative labour costs.", "Economic developments Interest rate expectations have been revised upwards in a number of countries.", "Growth has picked up in the US.", "As in the second half of 2003, growth is primarily being driven by private consumption and business investment.", "Following a surprisingly long period of weak labour market developments, employment has begun to edge up and is now higher than at the same time last year.", "In recent months, inflation has increased from a very low level.", "As a result, interest rate expectations have been revised upwards, and the key rate in the US is expected to be raised at the end of June.", "In the euro area, inflation has been approximately in line with the objective defined by the European Central Bank.", "The preliminary estimate for May points towards rising inflation, particularly as a result of higher oil prices.", "Capacity utilisation in the euro area is low and unemployment remains high.", "Growth potential is weaker than in the US, although GDP growth picked up in the first quarter.", "As in the US, private consumption is an important factor driving growth.", "Increased net exports also contributed to growth in the euro area in the first quarter.", "Interest rate expectations in the euro area have also been revised upwards somewhat recently.", "The market now expects the ECB to raise interest rates at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005.", "Interest rate expectations were continuously revised downwards up to March 2004.", "Interest rates abroad have been unusually low for 21\u20442 years.", "This has been the greatest challenge for our monetary policy.", "Even though a somewhat swifter rise is now expected, it appears that interest rates among our most important trading partners will remain low for a period ahead.", "In Norway, output growth has picked up after a growth pause.", "The interest rate reductions since 2002 have contributed to the turnaround and a soft landing for the economy.", "Private consumption is showing fairly strong growth.", "Household demand will probably be the most important driving force in the Norwegian economy in the period ahead.", "The analyses in Inflation Report 1/2004 indicate that inflation will remain low for a period, then rise through the summer and autumn.", "The depreciation of the krone from January 2003 and up to last winter is expected to push up prices for imported consumer goods, while the recent appreciation will have a dampening effect.", "In both March and April, inflation in Norway was approximately as projected in the Inflation Report.", "In April, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.2 per cent.", "Adjusted for some temporary factors, the year-on-year rise was 0.5 per cent.", "The rate of increase in the last three months was 1.1 per cent annualised.", "TNS Gallup's expectations survey indicates that expectations concerning inflation ahead are stable at about 21\u20442 per cent.", "As you know, Norges Bank has established a regional network.", "In the interview round conducted earlier this spring, our contacts in Region South-West reported that the pick-up in the economy is broadening out and gaining strength, and that it is no longer solely driven by stronger household demand.", "In addition to a high level of activity in the construction industry and strong growth in retail trade, the upturn is now also being driven by higher exports and increased activity in the petroleum industry.", "Optimism seems to be holding up, and the market outlook for the next six months is bright for all sectors, although brightest for retail trade and construction.", "So far, optimism has only resulted in a moderate willingness to invest.", "In general, investment remains at a normal, average level.", "The exception is housing investment and investment within retail trade.", "In contrast to earlier periods, several sectors, such as petroleum-related manufacturing, retail trade and services for the business sector, are now reporting rising employment.", "Growth in the Norwegian economy is probably somewhat stronger than projected in Inflation Report 1/04.", "On the other hand, capacity utilisation at the end of 2003 may have been somewhat lower than projected earlier.", "Consumer prices have moved approximately in line with projections in Inflation Report 1/2004.", "The aim of monetary policy is higher inflation.", "With the current low level of inflation, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant with regard to developments in consumer prices.", "However, consumer prices may show random variations from one month to the next.", "We now have several monthly observations showing a rise in prices that is consistent with the most recent forecasts.", "Later this year, we will receive further confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections.", "We also place emphasis on avoiding imbalances in the real economy.", "The economy is probably approaching a normal rate of capacity utilisation.", "When inflation increases from a very low level, this will provide a basis for gradually moving towards a more normal short- term interest rate level in Norway.", "This may counter excessive credit growth and excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term.", "Interest rate developments abroad may have a considerable influence on movements in the krone exchange rate.", "The inflation outlook in Norway implies that Norway will not be the frontrunner when other countries increase interest rates.", "Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 26 May 2004.", "Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent.", "According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 21\u20442 per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher."], "classifications": ["monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none",
