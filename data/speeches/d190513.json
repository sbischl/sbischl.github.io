compares with average annual growth of 2.6 percent in real gross domestic income over this period.", "By comparison, the average wealth of the households in the top decile of the income distribution

after factoring in the decline in stock prices at the end of last year.", "In contrast, the wealth of middle-income families still has not returned to its pre-crisis level, and lower-income families have a wealth shortfall of 16 percent.", "The gap is also large in absolute terms.", "At the end of 2018, the average middle- income household had wealth of about $340,000, while the average households in the top 10 percent of the income distribution had wealth of about $4.5 million (figure 3).", "The average wealth of the top income decile is now 13 times higher than that of the middle- income group, while it was 7 times higher in 1989.", "Given these developments, it is no surprise that the share of wealth held by middle-income households has declined over the past three decades.", "However, the extent of the decline is nonetheless striking: Today the 30 percent of households between the 40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution hold 13 percent of all wealth, down from 19 percent over the past three decades (figure 4).", "The top 10 percent of households by income now own 57 percent of all wealth-up from 47 percent 30 years ago.", "The 10 percent of households

out the contours of the overall level and growth of wealth owned by middle-income households, let us now turn to economic security.", "Basic financial security is one important marker of the middle class.", "Wealth is an important source of economic resilience for households, allowing them to handle unexpected expenses as well as providing them with the financial security to manage the usual changes in income over a lifetime.", "When we dig into the various liquid savings, assets, and liabilities that underlie the overall wealth numbers for middle-income households, the picture suggests limited room to absorb volatility in cash flows.", "Many middle-income families have relatively little in easily accessible, or liquid, savings, carry a significant amount of debt, and are concerned about the adequacy of their retirement savings.", "By drawing from several household surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve, we can gain important insights into how assets and liabilities of middle-income households affect their economic security.", "Research based on the 2016 SCF shows that only about one-fourth of middle-income households have enough liquid savings to cover six months of expenses-the amount often recommended by financial advisers-and only 4 in 10 could cover three months of expenses.", "The majority of middle-income households thus do not have sufficient liquid savings to weather a typical material financial disruption-for instance, one associated with a temporary job loss or illness.", "Even modest unexpected expenses could be disruptive for many middle-income families.", "According to the forthcoming results from the 2018 SHED, one-third of middle-income adults said that they would borrow money, sell something, or not be able to pay an unexpected $400 expense (figure 5).", "Drilling down further indicates that while 6 percent of middle-income adults said they would not be able to pay the expense using any means, 27 percent would borrow or sell something to pay the expense.", "The reliance on credit to meet unexpected expenses is pronounced among those already carrying a balance on their credit cards.", "Nearly 3 in 10 middle-income adults carry a balance on their credit card most or all of the time, and the same households are five times as likely to borrow if faced with a $400 expense as those who never carry a balance.", "Borrowing money is not the only way that middle-income households cope with unexpected expenses.", "In 2018, one-fourth of middle-income adults said they skipped some kind of medical care because of its cost, suggesting insufficient savings can have implications for physical health as well as financial health.", "Thus, low levels of savings can create a challenging cycle when material disruptions in income, or even smaller unexpected expenses, spiral into a broader financial setback.", "Financial security in retirement A key component of middle-class financial security is the cushion of savings to cover retirement.", "Here, the DFAs suggest some progress.", "One of the innovations of the DFAs is that they include defined benefit plans from the Financial Accounts in addition to defined contribution plans, whereas measures of household pension wealth in the SCF are confined to the latter.", "The balances in defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, in which retirement savings accumulate in an account, are typically simpler to measure.", "By contrast, the value of defined benefit plans requires estimating how much the future fixed payments each year in retirement are worth today.", "These future payments are a sizable asset for households, currently estimated at about $15 trillion, or about 70 percent of total pension assets.", "The DFAs indicate that the average pension wealth for middle-income households-including both types of plans-has increased 2.5 percent per year over the past three decades (figure 6).", "Pension assets are now the largest asset held by middle- income households, representing 40 percent of their wealth, substantially exceeding the 22 percent share of home equity in their wealth.", "In part, the growth in pension balances reflects the sustained decrease in long- term interest rates over this period, which has boosted the value of the future fixed payments associated with defined benefit pensions.", "It reflects the aging of the population, since households near or in retirement age have the largest accumulated levels of pension savings and are also likely hold a relatively greater share of defined benefit plans (figure 7).", "How do we square the growth in pension assets with survey evidence indicating that many households in the middle of the income distribution are concerned that they will not have enough to live on in retirement?", "Only 35 percent of middle-income adults, who are not retired, say that their retirement saving is on track, and 16 percent of middle- income adults do not have any money saved for retirement.", "In part, this may reflect the long-term shift by employers to defined contribution plans and away from defined benefit plans, especially in the private sector.", "While in 1989 more middle-income households had a defined benefit pension than a defined contribution plan, the reverse has been true since 1989.13 With defined contribution plans, employees have to decide how much they will save and how they will invest, and they face uncertainty regarding how much savings will be available in retirement.", "Those who save and invest effectively can help secure their retirement.", "But those who opt out, save too little, or make investment choices that turn out to yield low returns may find themselves unprepared as retirement approaches, despite years of hard work.", "Two-thirds of middle-income adults who hold self-directed accounts, including defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts, say that they have little or no comfort in managing the investments.", "Assets and liabilities Stepping back, it is instructive to look at the evolution of the underlying assets and liabilities of middle-class households more broadly.", "The liabilities of the average middle-income household have nearly doubled over the past three decades, while assets have increased only 50 percent (figure 8).", "The gap between the relative growth of liabilities and assets peaked during the financial crisis and has narrowed somewhat for middle-income households more recently.", "While mortgages rose and fell sharply around the Great Recession, the rise in consumer debt, such as credit cards, auto loans, and student loans, has been relatively steady.", "The rapid growth in liabilities reflects both short-term cash flow management and longer-term investments.", "Taking on debt is an important way for middle-income families to help buffer unexpected expenses or a temporary loss of income, as indicated by the 8 in 10 middle-income adults who are at least somewhat confident that they could obtain an additional credit card if they applied for it.", "Debt is also a critical mechanism for making key middle-class investments, which I turn to next.", "Investing in the Future There is a palpable sense that the opportunity to reach the middle class and remain in it is receding for many middle-income households.", "Many households find it challenging to make key middle-class investments because incomes at the middle are not keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership, and it is difficult to save enough.", "Often, making these investments requires having some savings in the first place-for instance, to make a down payment on a home, forgo income for a few years while paying tuition, or secure credit for a small business.", "Disparities by race and ethnicity This challenge is compounded for some racial and ethnic minority groups that have experienced large and persistent racial gaps in wealth.", "Even among households at the middle of the income distribution, the average wealth in 2016 of white households ($277,200) was roughly one and a half times that of black households ($179,700) and nearly three times that of Hispanic households ($95,400).", "Differences in educational attainment cannot fully account for these disparities: The average wealth of black households in which the head had a bachelor's degree ($271,200) was 26 percent less than that of white households in which the head did not attend college ($367,800).", "This matters not least because disparities in wealth often are inherited.", "The prospects that a young person will reach the middle class often depend on attributes he or she inherits-such as the income, wealth, education, age, race, and ethnicity of his or her parents.", "Beyond financial wealth, children inherit intangible assets that affect their ability to access information and social networks that help in obtaining jobs and taking advantage of educational and other wealth-building opportunities.", "Owning a home has been a key marker of middle-class status for many Americans.", "The accumulation of equity in a home is
