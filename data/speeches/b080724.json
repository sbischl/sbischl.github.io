which apparently is entering another very serious stage - it would be very dangerous to weaken Israel's banking system, which as a result of prudent management has not run into serious problems, despite the crisis.", "If we weaken Israel's banking system, its customers will be the first to pay the price.", "We must bear in mind, when dealing with the banks, that a robust banking system is essential for customers, normal economic activity, and growth.", "The danger to customers in the suggestion to separate the credit cards from This is an example of a proposal currently being formulated that at the end of the day would harm the banks' customers.", "It is a dangerous proposal.", "Separating the credit cards from the banks would not necessarily increase competition in the credit card markets, retail credit or retail banking, and in fact would probably have an adverse impact on consumers.", "Based on research we have carried out and experience abroad, it is clear that separating credit cards from the banks entails a high risk that it would increase the price of credit given via credit cards.", "Today the interest on credit via credit cards in Israel is significantly lower than on such credit abroad.", "In addition to which, as I mentioned, there is the risk that a further weakening of the banks would have both a direct adverse impact on customers and an indirect effect that would result from its negative impact on economic growth.", "The importance of the reform in bank fees I am in favor of this important reform, because it is likely to increase competition in the banking industry, to the benefit of its customers.", "The reform was the outcome of the intense efforts by the Knesset, mainly by Member of Knesset (MK) Moshe Kahlon, MK Gilad Ardan, the entire Economic Affairs Committee, and the Supervisor of Banks.", "Here I would like to compliment the staff of the Banking Supervision Department on the efforts they invested in this area, which resulted in a necessary and wellplanned reform.", "I would also like to mention the Ministry of Finance, the Director-General of the Anti-Trust Authority, expert advisers and consumer organizations, all of whom cooperated on this issue and supported the reform.", "The aim of this reform, which will affect us all, is to lower the costs paid by banks' customers.", "There are two ways of achieving this: one is by imposing wide-ranging supervision on bank fees, and the other is by increasing competition in the banking system, and lowering prices via market forces.", "The first method gives immediate results, but brings in its wake much damage, which I will describe later.", "The second approach is the right one, which will yield long-term gains to consumers and to the economy as a whole.", "The reform has increased the level of transparency with regard to fees, and transparency is essential to the development of competition.", "Thus, the reform reduced the oversized list of bank fees, gave them uniform names, and created the current situation in which, for the first time, customers know the prices they are asked to pay for banking services.", "As a result of these changes, consumers can compare prices and make informed decisions -
