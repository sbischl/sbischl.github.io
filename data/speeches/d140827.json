skills and knowledge to make assertive and rigorous assessments of a financial institution's IT risks and be able to form judgments about the adequacy of control systems.", "Training and development programmes for supervisors should therefore give the same emphasis as other critical risks such as credit and market risk.", "The establishment of specialist supervisory teams or units dedicated to IT risks also plays an important role in building a strong knowledge base within supervisory authorities to support effective supervision of IT risks.", "Just like industry practitioners, it is imperative that any knowledge and skills acquired by supervisors are in tandem with the latest developments in both cyber security and cyber threats.", "Beyond efforts to build technical capabilities, supervisors and other law enforcement agencies also need to be equipped with the legal powers to investigate and prosecute cyber criminals.", "Given the borderless nature of cyber risk, this is a significant challenge.", "Cyber crimes can be launched from anywhere in the world, with targets in many countries.", "This underscores the need for a more coordinated global response that should
