source of funding for the economy of country.", "Based on data recorded until September 2020, the expenditures of non-residents in Kosovo, most of which are from the diaspora, were 470 million Euros, which represents a decrease of about 60 percent compared to the same period of the previous year.", "On the other hand, when it comes to the connection of the diaspora with our economy, a factor that

that the country's economy was entering a pronounced crisis, where businesses and citizens were facing great financial difficulties, the CBK, based on international best practices and in cooperation with lending institutions in Kosovo, undertook a series of measures to help the economy cope more easily with the challenges of this crisis.", "These measures initially consisted of applying a moratorium on loan repayments without any punitive measures for all borrowers who have been adversely affected by the pandemic.", "This moratorium has temporarily relieved the borrower of the loan repayment burden, thus improving their liquidity position to finance other needs.", "Following the end of the moratorium period, the CBK has published a guide to loan restructuring in order to
