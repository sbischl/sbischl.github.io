activities resulted in: \uf0b7 the continued monitoring of systemic risks in the Standing Committee for Financial Stability, chaired by the Central Bank, \uf0b7 regularly performed macroeconomic stress tests, and \uf0b7 the signed memoranda on understanding and cooperation with regulators from the home countries of the banking groups operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "We have also established the Central Credit Registry which helps banks to manage risks, having insight into the credit histories of their clients in the entire country.", "Our cash operations underwent a serious test in October 2008, when, our citizens, in panic, withdrew significant amount of deposits from banks in only several days.", "Thanks to the prompt response, we provided enough foreign currency,

practices and \uf0b7 training our staff in compliance with the European standards.", "This contributes to the development of the culture that will help the entire society to recognize the Central
