Ma\u0304ori (the Ma\u0304ori world) needs to be a core competency of all New Zealand directors.", "I'll do this in two ways: \u2022 First, I want describe my own journey into Te Ao Ma\u0304ori.", "I'll highlight some of the ongoing work at Te Pu\u0304tea Matua - The Reserve Bank, and reflect on how we, as Pa\u0304keha, as Ma\u0304ori, as tauiwi, can improve our understanding of the Ma\u0304ori economy.", "\u2022 Second, I want to look beyond the Ma\u0304ori economy that exists today, and talk about how Te Ao Ma\u0304ori is shaping the future of Aotearoa New Zealand.", "When I reflect on my learning about Te Ao Ma\u0304ori to date, I'm reminded of how Ma\u0304ori describe our emergence into the world of light.", "Ka puta te ira tangata ki te whaiao, ki te ao ma\u0304rama.", "The phrase can refer both the first emergence of nga\u0304 Atua (the gods) into the light of day, and also to the dissemination of knowledge, when Ta\u0304ne (or Ta\u0304whaki, according to some iwi) returned from his trip to the highest of the heavens.", "It describes a progression, first ki te whaiao - to the glimmer of dawn, or a moment of recognition, and only then ki te ao ma\u0304rama, into the full light of day.", "I feel as though my understanding of Te O\u0304hanga Ma\u0304ori is somewhere along that progression.", "I've seen the glimmer, and recognised its significance, but I know I have a long way to go.", "It's a progression I am passionate about forging, and I'm fortunate to be working alongside many others on this path.", "At Te Pu\u0304tea Matua, we are working hard to gather new information to shed light on Te O\u0304hanga Ma\u0304ori, in the hope that we'll eventually emerge ki te ao ma\u0304rama.", "Since joining in 2019, I've been privileged to be a part of the journey of Te Pu\u0304tea Matua to learn about and embrace Te Ao Ma\u0304ori (the Ma\u0304ori world).", "Early last year, I gave a speech at the Raising Ma\u0304ori Investment Capability Conference (Hawkesby 2020), where I described the three core elements of our Te Ao Ma\u0304ori Strategy \u2022 Te reo me nga\u0304 tikanga - Culture - our effort to raise our collective knowledge and understanding of Ma\u0304ori language and culture \u2022 Whanaungatanga - Engagement - our efforts to strengthen the ties between the Reserve Bank and Ma\u0304ori people, Iwi, Ma\u0304ori business, and the Ma\u0304ori world \u2022 Kaitiakitanga - Policy - recognition of our responsibility as a policy maker and as guardian of the financial system Through this framework, we are working to gradually strengthen our understanding of and interactions with Te Ao Ma\u0304ori.", "Our Te Ao Ma\u0304ori approach Source: Reserve Bank of New Zealand But why is it so important that we at the Reserve Bank learn from and embrace Te Ao Ma\u0304ori in our day to day work?", "We are the central bank for all of Aotearoa.", "Ma\u0304ori people are our people.", "As kaitiaki (guardians) of the financial system, we have a responsibility to ensure that Ma\u0304ori have fair and equal access to the financial services they need - something our system has not always delivered.", "But it's not just about creating better outcomes for Ma\u0304ori.", "Ma\u0304ori language, history, and culture shape our identity as a country.", "Our economy has unique opportunities and challenges that set us apart from the rest of the world.", "We need to understand and acknowledge these complexities to be better policy makers for all of Aotearoa.", "We know we still have a long way to go.", "Luckily, we're not alone in our efforts to become a more diverse, inclusive, and representative central bank.", "Like us, the global central banking community is opening up to the importance of indigenous economies, and this means we've been able to learn from and share our learnings with international colleagues through the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (Reserve Bank 2021).", "Our mahi - Tikanga We aren't experts by a long way, but we are making good progress on integrating tikanga and Te Reo Ma\u0304ori into the daily life at Te Pu\u0304tea Matua.", "To grow our understanding, in partnership with the northern iwi of Te Roroa, we tell our story through the narrative of Ta\u0304ne Mahuta.", "Just as Ta\u0304ne stands firm as kaitiaki of the ngahere (forest), so too must we strive to stand firm as kaitiaki of the financial system (Reserve Bank 2018).", "Our kaupapa (agenda) is to maintain trust in our organisation so that Ta\u0304ne will not wilt and lose mana.", "Our offices in Auckland and Wellington have been designed to reflect elements of our Ta\u0304ne Mahuta narrative, such as the forest, sky, and earth.", "Each day as we walk through the security gates to enter our Wellington offices, Ta\u0304ne Ma\u0304huta looks back at us as a reminder of our responsibility (figure 2).", "Figure 2: Ta\u0304ne Mahuta in the Reserve Bank Lobby in Wellington Source: Reserve Bank of New Zealand Our mahi - Kaitiakitanga One of our responsibilities as kaitiaki of the financial system is to remove barriers to allow the Ma\u0304ori economy to thrive.", "Our Te Moni Anamata - Future of Cash work programme (Reserve Bank of New Zealand, n.d.) considers the barriers that may emerge from a contracting cash system.", "It explores how access to physical currency supports financial inclusion for our kaumatua (elders), enables koha (customary gifting), and helps support Ma\u0304ori economies to thrive independently on ancestral lands, which may be further from our main population centres and have less access to digital payments.", "Looking forward, the next big challenge we face is understanding the factors that limit Ma\u0304ori access to capital.", "A recent survey (BDO 2020) found that funding and access to capital were two of the greatest challenges faced by Ma\u0304ori businesses.", "We want to learn more about how factors like collective land ownership, lower home ownership, and systematic bias might be affecting the rates at which Ma\u0304ori businesses access debt and other forms of financing.", "You can read more about this in our Financial Stability Report (Reserve Bank 2021), published yesterday.", "We want to find ways to remove those barriers, so that te ma\u0304ra o Ta\u0304ne (Ta\u0304ne's garden, our financial system) can flourish.", "Our mahi - Whanaugatanga We recognise that iwi are already working tirelessly to address the challenges Ma\u0304ori face in the financial world.", "Just last month we published a review of Ma\u0304ori financial services institutions and arrangements (Mcleod and Lam, 2021).", "We discovered a broad range of innovative solutions to increase financial inclusions, literacy, and security for Ma\u0304ori.", "Initiatives such as collective marae insurance, and shared equity housing initiatives are helping more and more Ma\u0304ori find success in the financial world.", "So while we work to remove barriers, we know we need to do so in open dialogue with Ma\u0304ori, to ensure that we are providing a system that serves all of our communities.", "Te O\u0304hanga Ma\u0304ori in Data While we continue to grow our understanding of Te Ao Ma\u0304ori through the lens of Te Reo me nga\u0304 tikanga, we are also working to build a more detailed view of the Ma\u0304ori economy through data.", "In aid of this, we recently commissioned Berl to produce a report that measures the Ma\u0304ori economy, Te O\u0304hanga Ma\u0304ori 2018, the Ma\u0304ori Economy Report (Berl 2020).", "We commissioned the report because we think it's important to shine a light on this vital part of our economy, not just as a resource for ourselves, but also for local and central government, iwi, community groups, and for you as directors.", "We recognise that there are a lot of important collective decisions that need to be made, and we're proud to be part of the conversation.", "The Berl report gives a fact based grounding for our understanding and decision making.", "It updates a similar report produced by Berl in 2013, and compliments other recent Ma\u0304ori economy research such as the Te Matapaeroa report from Te Puni Ko\u0304kiri (2020).", "But more important are the themes of vibrancy, variety, and growth that challenge historical stereotypes.", "Ma\u0304ori collectives and businesses are supporting the wellbeing of their people through a broad range of channels, including; \u2022 Community engagement, participation, and contribution \u2022 Wha\u0304nau and family caring \u2022 Paid employment \u2022 Unpaid voluntary work \u2022 Trust and business enterprise activities.", "The Ma\u0304ori economy extends far beyond the scale of Treaty settlements and far beyond the traditional industries of Fishing, Forestry, Farming, and Tourism.", "Ma\u0304ori business is becoming increasingly diversified and dynamic, with high numbers of skilled Ma\u0304ori moving into entrepreneurship and employing considerable numbers of people.", "The employment base is expanding too.", "Between 2013 and 2018, the Ma\u0304ori population grew by 30 percent, and the number of Ma\u0304ori in employment grew by a massive 47 percent.", "More and more Ma\u0304ori are joining the labour force each year and, at least prior to the disruption of COVID-19, they were finding successful employment at the highest rate in almost a decade (Stats NZ 2018).", "The Ma\u0304ori population is expected to continue to grow.", "Ma\u0304ori are young, and they're growing their families faster than the average for Aotearoa.", "Currently, Ma\u0304ori represent 17 percent of the population.", "All of these trends are described in great detail in Berl's report.", "The authors have gone to great lengths to provide a detailed analysis of the data we have available, to help shape these emerging narratives about Te O\u0304hanga Ma\u0304ori.", "For those who haven't already, I strongly recommend that everyone in this room takes some time to explore some of their insights.", "The themes which emerge add up to a view that the future of the New Zealand economy is Ma\u0304ori.", "Ki te Ao Ma\u0304rama When I say that the future is Ma\u0304ori, I'm not just talking about Ma\u0304ori people, Ma\u0304ori businesses, or Ma\u0304ori jobs.", "Perhaps one of the most powerful ways in which Ma\u0304ori will shape the future of Aotearoa New Zealand is through Ma\u0304ori values.", "For generations, Ma\u0304ori economic relationships have been guided by core principles like manaakitanga (respect and generosity), kaitiakitanga (guardianship), and whanaungatanga (relationships).", "While I don't claim to be an expert on these values, it is easy to see how these guiding principles have led to some common themes in the Ma\u0304ori approach to the economy: \u2022 Firstly, Ma\u0304ori businesses aim to support collective rather than individual wellbeing.", "This means success is often measured across dimensions other than profit.", "\u2022 Secondly, that collectivism extends to future generations, meaning Ma\u0304ori have an emphasis on kaitiakitanga and take a long-term, intergenerational view of decision making.", "\u2022 Thirdly, our responsibilities to Papatu\u0304a\u0304nuku are deeply ingrained in Ma\u0304ori thinking, meaning environmental sustainability and respect stand at the foreground of business decisions.", "In the past, some observers might have described a 'tension' between these values and a firm's drive to generate profit, implying that these values can hold firms back from recognising their economic potential.", "But if that were ever true, it certainly does not describe the future of the New Zealand economic landscape as I see it standing here today.", "Indeed, the Productivity Commission (2020) recently produced a fascinating report which notes how Ma\u0304ori businesses can leverage their unique identity and values to strengthen their value proposition.", "It would seem that mainstream social values are becoming increasingly Ma\u0304ori.", "We see this in government, with the introduction of the Wellbeing and Living Standards framework (The Treasury 2019).", "We see it in business, with the rise of socially driven enterprise, and the large number of traditional firms actively targeting their impact on climate change.", "We see the same trends reflected in investment choices.", "Whereas sustainable and impact investing were once niche strategies, incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into investment decisions is now standard practice.", "Firms which can effectively generate a virtuous circle of economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, financial inclusion, and cultural diversity are being rewarded for their efforts.", "In many ways, it seems the Pa\u0304keha world is catching up with Te Ao Ma\u0304ori, and this is a trend I expect to continue.", "We only need to look to our rangatahi (youth), and the fierce enthusiasm with which they approach kaupapa like climate change, racial inequality, and social justice, to see that Ma\u0304ori values are shaping our future.", "As our schools, iwi, and community groups continue to promote and develop proficiency in Te Reo Ma\u0304ori and tikanga Ma\u0304ori, they will further accelerate this process.", "Our mokopuna (grandchildren) will know and accept te tirohanga Ma\u0304ori ki te ao (the Ma\u0304ori worldview) as an integral part of life in Aotearoa.", "And to them I say kia kaha (keep it up).", "The future of the New Zealand economy is Ma\u0304ori, and it's bright.", "As directors, these are the values of your future employees, customers, shareholders, stakeholders, and business partners.", "Which leads us to the natural conclusion that an understanding of Te Ao Ma\u0304ori must be a core competency for all New Zealand directors.", "Not only because Ma\u0304ori deserve to have their values represented, not only because it's our obligation under the Treaty of Waitangi, but because the Ma\u0304ori world view is an increasingly integral aspect of the New Zealand society that we all serve.", "That is why I am delighted that the Maori Economy is a prominent part of this Institute of Directors Leadership Conference, as we take these first steps of information, awareness and understanding together.", "Whakakapinga (conclusion) Ma\u0304 te rongo ka mo\u0304hio, ma\u0304 te mo\u0304hio ka ma\u0304rama, ma\u0304 te ma\u0304rama ka ma\u0304tau, ma\u0304 te ma\u0304tau ka ora.", "(Through information comes awareness, through
