prevails and property rights and contract enforcements are more effective, progress has been faster than otherwise.", "In Nigeria, examples abound as to how alternative legal-institutional infrastructure emasculated development.", "The constant changes or suspension of aspects of the Constitution during military rule created uncertainties.", "There was also unpredictability in the laws

telecommunications, power, and some infrastructure obviously retarded private investment in these areas.", "An institutional framework (a legal system a la the Constitution) which has proliferated states and assured them of unconditional access to 'statutory allocation of revenues from the centre' destroys the known basis of human progress - competition.", "A constitutional provision that allocates such resources to states with powers to spend without any strong oversight institution has created a rentier system and perpetuated a culture of 'cake sharing' without any attention to 'cake baking' especially at some of the lower tiers of government.", "It has also destroyed the fundamental umbilical cord between the state and business.", "The relationship between state and business is a strategic and mutually beneficial one: states depend on businesses to create jobs and to pay taxes to the state; in turn states provide the enabling environment to help businesses thrive.", "The dependence on 'statutory allocation' has destroyed that relationship in most cases to the extent that many states hardly pay attention to enterprise development.", "If they can get all the money they need from 'allocation', why care about businesses whose taxes amount to pittance?", "Today, not many states care about creating an environment conducive for enterprises to locate in their states or aggressively marketing their states for investment.", "This Constitutional provision in Nigeria is one example of how a legal-institutional framework can create perverse incentive system and hence retard the process of economic transformation.", "On the other hand, there are several new laws and institutions which have unleashed the momentum for progress.", "A few examples suffice: A programme of economic liberalization and deregulation which has enlarged the domain of businesses that private sector can get into, and see how it has unleashed progress in the airline industry, banking and finance, telecommunications sector, private universities, etc.", "\u2022 Energy Reform Act and now private sector investment in building power plants The 'Due Process' in procurement system which has

Pension Act with potentials for shoring up Nigeria's capital market, and offering new incentive structure for workers \u2022 The monetization programme and asset distribution programme thereby empowering workers and minimizing waste by government The privatization programme helping hitherto dead public enterprises to resurrect and survive under competition and also significantly altering

evidence from the rest of the world that institutional quality and character significantly impact on economic development.", "Empirically, countries that have better institutional quality (however defined) grow much faster and enjoy better standards of living than countries with weaker institutions.", "Even the political and legal institutions define the incentive system under which policymakers operate, and determine whether government facilitates or inhibits economic development.", "Empirically, the issue is no longer whether institutions matter; to a large extent also, it is not even about which institutions matter (at least the most critical ones that promote property rights, foster competition, enforce contracts, and make markets and allocation of resources more efficient and equitable can be identified).", "There is one fundamental question that needs serious analytical attention namely; how to design and introduce effective and efficient institutions.",

supplied ahead of demand for them?", "Do you merely transplant the institutions from one society to another (revolutionary or radical change), or is there path dependence (where initial conditions in society's evolution play a dominant role), and hence the process of institution creation is adaptive and evolutionary.", "This is a question for our eminent legal luminaries and institutional economists to address, and the jury is still out on these questions.", "Often, one hears Nigerians swing to either of the pendulums depending on the convenience.", "In one case, people will argue that it took the first world economies hundreds of years to evolve the institutions and legal infrastructure that have propelled them to their present state.", "The conclusion from this line of thinking is that Nigeria is trying to run too fast and we should adopt laws and institutions that 'suit our culture or environment' - whatever that means.", "For these people, culture and environment are constant, and one needs only to search for appropriate laws and institutions to fit.", "On the other hand, people try to compare Nigeria with America, Japan, Malaysia, etc and wonder why our leaders cannot give us a society like those.", "Put differently, it is akin to the debate about the nature of leadership and society: some argue that a society gets the leadership it deserves (leadership as endogenous) while others argue that leadership emerges to propel a society to a path it could otherwise not evolve on its own (exogenous).", "In other words, does Nigeria have the kind of institutions it deserves given its culture and level of development or should we actively and creatively design new institutions that would propel us to achieve the vision of being one of the largest economies in the next two decades?", "What should those institutions be?", "My view is that it is not an issue of either of the two polar positions of either evolution or revolution.", "Nigeria cannot and should

as the states are not under pressure to create wealth through promotion of private enterprise, propelling the Nigerian economy would amount to an aeroplane trying to fly with only one wing.", "Another set of institutional reforms to move the economy forward pertains to the judiciary itself.", "Its processes and skill-set may need scaling up.", "Specially, improvements may be required in the remuneration, technology and skills of judges.", "Structured training for judges in specialized areas and especially the use of IT in court processes will have to be encouraged.", "One aspect of the reform of the judiciary is a consideration of a specialized division of the High courts devoted to commercial cases, especially bordering on property rights and contract enforcement.", "This is the heart of a market economy.", "The first principle of justice I learnt is that justice delayed is justice denied.", "Indeed, the speed of dispensation of justice especially the enforcement of contracts and property rights is increasingly becoming one of the measures of extent of economic advancement.", "This is because if commercial issues- contract rights and property rights are not easily enforceable, market-based economic systems cannot prosper.", "The Central Bank of Nigeria is committed to this reform, and is ready to partner with the Judiciary and other stakeholders to ensure its success.", "The final example of an institutional process that must be strengthened to ensure rapid economic transformation is to evolve a free and fair electoral system in which every vote is counted

believe that election results can be 'written or manipulated', then political parties will not be under pressure to search for qualified, credible candidates who can win elections; and responsible candidates will be discouraged from offering themselves for service.", "For sustained economic transformation, credible leadership must emerge out of a fair electoral process.", "I must now conclude this boring lecture.", "Nigeria has all it takes to rapidly transform from a third world to a first world economy.", "The Obasanjo administration is laying a very solid foundation for that to happen.", "The challenge is to sustain the momentum for several decades as Singapore and other newly industrializing countries did.", "Today in Nigeria, the most frequently asked question is whether the Obasanjo's reforms will be sustained.", "The answer, in my view, lies in the law and institutions.", "It is my belief that individuals make a difference, but for sustained development of a society, institutions make all the difference.", "Evolving, adapting or creating the appropriate institutions remains the cardinal challenge of our transformation agenda.", "Now that we have the courage to envision a prosperous society in the near future, we must also have the ingenuity to fashion the legal- institutional framework to propel the new economy.", "And Nigeria has enough geniuses
