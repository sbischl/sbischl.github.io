the case of Italy.", "In both periods of exceptionally rapid growth (1895-1913 and 1950-1970), remittances were a crucial factor, eliminating the external constraint.", "In more recent times, Italian emigration has waned, and Italy - historically a source of emigration - has become an increasingly attractive destination for migrants (since the late 1980s immigration has regularly outweighed emigration).", "Since 1999, Italy has recorded a net outflow of migrants' remittances.", "The Heads of State and Government of the G8 countries, which are the main remittancesending economies, first dealt with remittances at the Sea Island Summit in 2004.", "Since then, a number of initiatives have been taken to improve information on remittance flows, to facilitate transfers and reduce fees, to ensure the safety and integrity of financial flows and to enhance their developmental impact.", "From the very start the Bank of Italy has contributed to this agenda, since most of the G8 goals in this sphere fall within the Bank's institutional mandate.", "In the last four years, for instance, our research department has produced papers on the role of remittances in the Mediterranean

authorities have focused their work on immediate solutions to apply the first of the General Principles for International Remittances Services, namely: \"The market for remittances should be transparent and have adequate consumer protection\".", "In line with this principle, many countries are developing national remittance price comparison databases in order to increase market transparency, providing information to migrants who want to send money home that should enable them to acquire the information essential to informed choice.", "At present the market for remittances is not always fully transparent.", "Two issues are particularly relevant: total price and speed of service.", "The cost of a money transfer is not actually easy to calculate due to two variable components, i.e.", "transfer fee and exchange rate.", "Consequently, the consumer may not know exactly the amount of money the receiver will get.", "The difficulty is compounded for migrants, who due to poor financial education, language barriers and time constraints, may have difficulty in accessing certain services, in particular bank services.", "This may result in the impossibility of comparing alternative remittances services and finding the most economical.", "The ready availability of information fosters competitive markets, as demand will tend to concentrate on the most efficient remittance service providers, those offering quick service at lower cost.", "The national websites compliant with the World Bank standards provide all the information required for informed decisions: the fees charged, the exchange rate applied and the time necessary for the money to be available.", "The Bank of Italy welcomes the creation of a national price comparison website and will support its management, facilitating data collection and providing information on the most significant corridors and on the latest updates in the retail payment market.", "This initiative is consistent with the overall approach taken by the Bank in performing payment system oversight, whose aim is to promote efficiency.", "In this particular market efficiency is all the more important in

main lines of action are elimination of non-explicit price mechanisms and achievement of greater certainty on the terms applied in the supply of payment services.", "National legislation has to transpose the obligations laid down under these provisions with regard to \"two-leg\" transactions only, those in which both payment service providers (if there are more than one) are located within the EEA.", "But Italy has opted for broader scope, extending the transparency rules also to one-leg transactions in which only one of the service providers is located in the EEA.", "The information requirements concern both the conditions of the service (ex ante transparency) and the effective execution of the transaction (ex post transparency).", "They vary with the nature of the payment service contract and the needs of the customer.", "A new category of payment service provider is also envisaged by the Directive: the \"payment institution\".", "This represents an opportunity for
