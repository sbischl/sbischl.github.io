in particular, here at the European Central Bank (ECB) - have used this knowledge.", "In the years prior to the financial crisis, the empirical literature on finance and growth accumulated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that financial sector deepening is a key component of the economic development process.", "This appeared to be true, both in respect of emerging markets and industrialised economies.", "Encouraged by such evidence, policy-makers did not question the ability of the financial sector to innovate and channel funds to their most socially productive uses.", "In the words of the Federal Reserve's then Chairman Alan Greenspan: \"[...] our financial system, whose job it is to ensure the productive use of physical capital, has been such a crucial part of our overall economy, especially over the past two decades.", "It is the signals reflected in financial asset prices, interest rates, and risk spreads that have altered the structure of our output in recent decades towards a different view of what consumers judge as value.", "\"2 Yet, economies with large, dynamic, and complex financial sectors are not immune to severe macroeconomic contractions.", "In fact, the banking crises literature provided some evidence on a causal link between rapid credit growth and systemic banking distress long before the emergence of the global financial crisis.", "Furthermore, the output costs of severe banking crises have been found to be of a large magnitude.", "Are these two observations contradictory?", "Not necessarily - both are related to wellunderstood economic mechanisms.", "On the one hand, mature financial industries ensure the efficient allocation of productive resources, supporting long-term growth.", "On the other hand, excessive leverage can throw the financial system into a crisis resulting in deep and abrupt economic downturns.", "The crisis has made us understand that the size of the financial sector can exacerbate the trade-off between economic efficiency and financial stability.", "While finance per se is necessary for growth, an oversized financial industry can be detrimental to real economic activity.", "Of course, the question of what constitutes an \"oversized\" financial sector is a complex one, and the collection of papers on the programme of this conference makes great progress towards providing an answer.", "Recent changes to the global regulatory architecture, particularly regarding the banking union in Europe, are in part aimed at mitigating the negative effects that a large and complex modern financial industry can have.", "These changes should be implemented in a way that avoids eliminating the positive impact of financial services on growth and tackling financial complexity with overly complicated and excessive regulatory interventions.", "In addition, policy-makers should be increasingly aware of the importance of overcoming fragmentation in European capital markets and of achieving a single market for capital.", "Identifying the problem As regards the link between finance and growth, for a long time, it was common to say that finance affects growth in a positive, monotonic way, as if more is always better.", "Recent empirical evidence, however, has qualified this conventional wisdom.", "The analysis has now been refined to show that, beyond a threshold size, the effect of finance on long-term economic growth can weaken and even become negative.", "Why is the effect of finance on growth non-linear?", "Recent academic research puts forward at least five possible explanations.", "First, the financial sector has gradually extended its scope beyond the traditional activity of intermediation towards so-called \"non-intermediation\" financial activities, such as trading.", "The evidence strongly suggests that banking strategies which are heavily geared towards generating non-interest income are riskier.", "This change in focus is naturally associated with a higher potential for systemic crisis.", "Moreover, as a result, it has become increasingly more difficult to come up with empirical measures of financial services that are consistent with what modern-day finance actually does.", "This is especially true for high-income economies whose financial sectors are particularly sophisticated.", "Second, the financial system can grow too large relative to the real economy because it can extract excessively high informational rents and pay excessively high wages.", "For example, while in the wake of World War II the financial sector accounted for less than 2.5% of total labour income, in 2006, this share was 8.3%.", "As a result, too much young talent can be reallocated towards the financial industry.", "To put it more bluntly: the world before the crisis Brunnermeier, M., and Y.
