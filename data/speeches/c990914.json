increase in exports.", "Reflecting such developments in final demand and continued progress in inventory adjustment, industrial production is turning to an increase.", "Against this background, corporate and consumer sentiment has seen an improvement.", "The improvement in corporate sentiment, however, has not necessarily stimulated business activities, because firms strongly feel that they

remain.", "In the financial market, the overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero and financial institutions have been confident about the availability of overnight funds.", "As for interest rates
