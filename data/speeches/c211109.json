in person, remotely and online as appropriate and feasible.", "Credit unions have also provided flexibility to members on loan repayments, providing payment breaks to impacted members and engaging with members to ensure that sustainable repayment arrangements are put in place.", "Environmental context The Central Bank's statutory mandate requires us to regulate the credit union sector with a view to ensuring the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of the sector.", "Our role therefore necessarily focuses on both how members' funds are safeguarded and the viability of the sector as whole.", "This informs our risk appetite and overall strategy towards the credit union sector.", "Our wider ambition for the financial sector is that the financial system is resilient and trustworthy and that it sustainably services the needs of the economy and its consumers -

investments and lending.", "In 2018, to facilitate increased diversification, we introduced additional classes of investment in which credit unions may invest surplus funds.", "While development of appropriate investment structures for some of these new classes has taken time, recent developments will facilitate investment in approved housing bodies and corporate bonds for those credit unions seeking to do so.", "In 2020, we introduced changes to the lending framework providing those credit unions with the financial strength, competence and capability, flexibility to undertake increased longer term lending, including home mortgage and business lending.", "After this period of significant change, the Central Bank is not planning further significant changes to the specific regulations directly focused on the credit union sector in the foreseeable future.", "That is not to say we are closed to the possibility of future changes, and we will continue to engage with sector representatives and the Oireachtas on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the credit union regulatory framework.", "Notwithstanding this degree of relative stability, credit union boards and management will have to continue to address regulatory and legislative change relevant to the financial services system as a whole.", "One such area where there is increasing scrutiny relates to AML / CTF, as recognised by the theme of this event.", "At an international level, shortcomings in the AML and CTF frameworks and approaches have been recognised and we can, consequently, expect changes to underlying regulations and the supervision of AML and CTF matters.", "It is vitally important that Ireland, as a small, open economy with a thriving financial services industry, is pro-active in preventing its financial system from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes.", "All financial service providers, including credit unions, have an important role in achieving this.", "The Central Bank is the competent authority for AML/ CFT supervision of credit unions.", "This requires us to effectively monitor credit unions' compliance with their legislative obligations and, where weaknesses are identified, to take actions that are reasonably necessary and proportionate to ensure compliance.", "In delivering on this mandate, in September 2019 the Central Bank published AML/CFT Guidelines for the Financial Sector, which were subsequently revised in June 2021 to reflect changes in the legislation.", "The purpose of these Guidelines is to provide clarity on the Central Bank's expectations in respect of compliance with AML/CFT obligations as set out in: the Criminal Justice Act 2010; Central Bank AML/CFT sectoral reports/ bulletins; and relevant European Supervisory Authority Guidelines.", "Areas of focus for Board Oversight Committee members I will now turn to highlight a number of key areas that will need to be the fore of Board Oversight Committee members' minds in striving for a thriving credit union sector.", "Governance, Culture and Board Oversight Board Oversight Committees have a unique role in assessing whether the board of directors are operating in accordance with their governance obligations thereby supporting strong governance and risk management frameworks in credit unions.", "The nature and effectiveness of the approach by Board Oversight Committees is important, with a need for clarity of purpose and constructive engagement and challenge.", "In assessing board performance you should expect an understanding of - and compliance with - the spirit as well as the letter of prudential standards.", "It is the responsibility of the board to set the 'tone from the top', by clearly articulating the core values and desired culture of the credit union and to ensure that their behaviours reflect those values.", "Likewise, the behaviours of Board Oversight Committee members should also reflect the culture and values of the credit union.", "Credit union culture has evolved significantly since the statutory changes introduced in 2012/13.", "This has been driven by a number of factors including the introduction of detailed governance requirements, the implementation of the Fitness and Probity regime, the impact of restructuring and resolution and the response of credit unions to our supervisory and enforcement engagements and actions.", "Individual credit unions need to build on this progress, continuing to focus on promoting and embedding an effective culture within their credit union - a culture that continues to be focused on members' needs, but also is effective in embracing change, and successfully managing risk.", "And it is this culture that will be key to the long term success of both individual credit unions and the sector as a whole.", "Effective governance and risk management better enable firms to take appropriate risks and be sustainably successful.", "The Central Bank's Credit Union Supervisory Commentary reports have continued to highlight weaknesses in these areas, which need to be addressed.", "We will shortly publish the findings of a thematic review undertaken on the maturity of risk management frameworks in credit unions and I urge credit union board members and managers to consider the findings, that will be set out in the report, to support them in enhancing and embedding their risk management frameworks to ensure they can identify and mitigate evolving and emerging risks.", "Strategic business model change I have described some of the forces driving change in the financial services system.", "Credit unions have existing business model challenges -

such as the introduction of the Member Personal Current Account Service, developed as part of a collaborative effort by a group of credit unions.", "Further, there has also been some change in the maturity profile of credit union loan books reflecting a start in utilisation of the additional capacity provided in 2020 -

consistent with their strategic plans and risk appetite.", "As well as the provision of core savings and lending services to members, there is a list of 'exempt' service prescribed in the Credit Union regulations and credit unions may provide other services, where approved by the Central Bank, which are of mutual benefit to their members and which do not impose undue risk to members' savings.", "Successful utilisation of the capacity available within the framework requires leadership, strategic thinking and effective sector collaboration, supported by strong governance and effective and embedded risk management.", "These are critical enablers for credit unions to address the challenges they face and avail of development opportunities.", "Responsibility for meeting these challenges rests first and foremost with the board of each credit union, although there remains a need for greater sectoral leadership too.", "Each board must set and own the strategic plan for its credit union.", "The strategy should be clear in identifying and setting out actions to address current and emerging sustainability challenges.", "Individually and collectively, credit unions need to form and realise a clear vision of their role in the provision of financial services and ensure that they can implement the necessary business model and technological changes to realise their vision and fulfil this role for their members in a safe and sustainable way.", "Strategic plans need to be tailored to the credit union's individual financial circumstances and capabilities, as well as common bond dynamics, while addressing operational and commercial challenges.", "Strategic plans should demonstrate sound and prudent risk-focused strategy formulation, business planning and implementation, aimed at the sustainable delivery of member products and services.", "Post restructuring development The sector has undergone significant restructuring in recent years.", "Restructuring provides strategic transfer solutions for weaker credit unions, enabling affected members to retain access to credit union services and indeed gain access to a wider range of services provided by stronger, larger credit unions.", "Restructuring also offers opportunities for other credit unions to build scale and reach by coming together voluntarily.", "This restructuring has resulted in a significant change in the asset size profile of the sector.", "At 30 September 2021 there were 213 trading credit unions; down from 343 at 30 September 2015.
