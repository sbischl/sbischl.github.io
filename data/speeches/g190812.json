of innovation to address real pain points and drive greater value creation.", "This means delivering integrated solutions to enhance the value proposition to end-users.", "In the e-wallet space, we have noticed the practice by some players in offering generous rewards including cashback to stimulate usage among users.", "While such practice may be effective in driving e-wallet adoption at the

management services to customers and businesses.", "In harnessing customer data, there are clear synergies between existing and new players.", "Incumbents have vast amounts of data, but legacy systems and culture can pose challenges to turn such data into insights.", "On the contrary, new players could face the opposite challenge - with more agile technological capabilities built from the ground-up, but having little or no data to work with.", "It is thus no surprise that more strategic partnerships between traditional and new players are emerging, in Malaysia and abroad.", "Such

efficiency through wider network reach and economies of scale.", "Last year, we established the Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework that facilitates fair and open access for banks and non-banks to

on secure methods for allowing trusted third parties to access a broader range of banking information through open APIs, with the customer's consent.", "Last but not least, is payment ecosystem resilience.", "While interoperable, standardised and open systems may facilitate enhanced efficiency and competition, it may also introduce new risks in such systems due to the increased interlinkages.", "All future-proofing efforts must therefore be anchored on enhancing operational resilience, including cyber resilience, in a rapidly evolving risk and threat landscape.", "To this end, the Bank had recently issued its policy on Risk Management in Technology (RMIT).", "This sets out baseline standards for financial institutions, and addresses key fundamentals of technology
