economy through purchases of goods and services.", "The result has often been high and uncontrolled inflation.", "Quantitative easing is different.", "In the same way as traditional monetary policy, the way quantitative easing is able to influence the wider economy is through lower interest rates and higher securities prices.", "The transmission mechanism of quantitative easing to the real economy operates through several channels.", "First, the central banks' purchases have supported their communication concerning future policy rates.", "When central banks purchase long-term government bonds, this is in itself a signal that policy rates will be kept low for a long time.", "This also pushes down interest rates on other securities.", "Chart: Long-term yields and term premiums In addition, the central banks' purchases have pushed up prices for government bonds and pushed down yields.", "Term premiums on government bonds have fallen.", "While 10-year government bond yields in

pre-crisis period.", "A fourth transmission channel operates via global financial markets.", "Cross-border capital movements as a result of portfolio rebalancing have generated exchange rate fluctuations.", "Unconventional monetary policy can contribute to a depreciation of the domestic currency, providing a positive extra effect of the policy in the short term.", "However, the effect diminishes when a number of countries implement quantitative easing and policy rate cuts in parallel.", "Exchange rate movements may then quickly reverse.", "Increased volatility creates an environment of uncertainty.", "Capital inflows and a stronger exchange rate have at the same time created challenges in other countries, not least in some emerging economies., We can conclude that,

side-effects.", "Returns on low-risk securities have been pushed down to a very low level.", "Investors facing a required nominal rate of return may have invested in higher-risk projects than they would otherwise have chosen.", "As growth prospects improve and monetary policy normalises in the US and Europe, capital flows may be reversed.", "This may result in increased volatility and wide

downward trend in real interest rates that can be attributed to a number of structural developments.", "Lowering policy rates is a response to these developments.", "For several decades towards the end of the twentieth century, growth in the labour force and higher levels of education boosted economic growth.", "Growth was accompanied by high returns and considerably higher real interest rates than observed in recent years.", "Growth impulses have gradually become weaker.", "Productivity growth has declined.", "The labour force is growing more slowly in many countries.", "At the same time, other structural changes are providing the motivation to save more: population aging and rising income inequality.", "In sum, these factors have contributed to lower real interest rates, even when economies have been in balance.", "Following the financial crisis, interest rates have fallen even further.", "Economies had been completely thrown off balance.", "Nor was there much help to be obtained from other policy areas.", "The role of central banks has been to counteract an even deeper and more prolonged downturn.", "This is the challenge to which monetary policy has responded.", "Chart: Investment and consumption But there have been strong headwinds.", "We have had an illustration of the claim that downturns following financial crises are deeper and more persistent than other downturns.", "As a result, the impact of monetary policy has been weaker than otherwise.", "Enterprises, households and governments made use of ample capital and low interest rates in the precrisis years to debt finance consumption and investment.", "When the downturn occurred, there was a need for considerable deleveraging, while weak growth prospects have dampened the willingness to invest.",

persisted for a long time, dampening the willingness to take on financial risk, and the willingness to save has increased.", "The pace of global growth is expected to pick up gradually in the coming

stands idle.", "However, growth is gradually picking up.", "It is difficult to judge to what extent the recovery abroad can be attributed to the monetary policy that has been conducted.", "There is, however, little doubt that it has had a positive effect.", "Lower interest rates have given firms and households access to cheaper funding.", "It has also eased the interest burden for heavily indebted borrowers and contributed to growth in disposable income.", "In addition, the value of households' financial wealth has increased.", "This may also have provided a basis for higher demand.", "Studies conducted so far also suggest that the unconventional measures have had an effect.", "A study by the Federal Reserve suggests that the Fed's asset purchase program has reduced unemployment by 11\u20444 percentage points and increased inflation by 1\u20442 percentage point.", "The Bank of England estimates that the Bank's purchases of government bonds from 2011 to 2012 boosted GDP by just over 1\u20442 percent.", "The effect on inflation was also found to be positive.", "Chart: Money market rates Nevertheless, in view of how far monetary policy has been stretched, growth abroad has not been overwhelming.", "The expected rise in policy rates has been repeatedly pushed further out in time.", "Traditional advanced economies are facing deep structural challenges related to low growth that must be addressed by other measures.", "Monetary policy easing and low interest rates do not result in permanently higher growth.", "The causal relationship goes in the opposite direction: prospects for prolonged low growth result in a long period of low interest rates.", "Ripple effects on the Norwegian economy Monetary policy in Norway is oriented towards keeping inflation low and stable.", "The operational target is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5% over time.", "The inflation target provides a nominal anchor for the economy.", "When inflation expectations are firmly anchored, monetary policy can serve as the first line of defence when the economy turns down.", "The key policy rate is set with a view to stabilising developments in the Norwegian economy.", "At the same time, the interest rate level abroad influences the policy rate in Norway, particularly through the exchange rate.", "Norges Bank's interest rate forecasts have been adjusted as expectations regarding policy rates abroad have fallen.", "The alternative could have been an excessive appreciation of the krone and the risk of excessively low inflation.", "The interest rate level in Norway was therefore low even before oil prices began to fall last summer.", "It is not only through low policy rates Norway's economy is influenced by monetary policy abroad.", "In a number of areas, we import the effects other central banks are seeking to achieve through quantitative easing.", "Chart: Yields on 10-year government bonds One example is the government bond market.", "For

investors have turned to the Norwegian equity market.", "Equity prices on Oslo B\u00f8rs have tracked the rise in equity prices abroad.", "Even when oil prices - and oil equities - began to fall, the rest of Oslo B\u00f8rs continued to rise.", "The commercial property market is another example of foreign capital finding its way to Norway in search of higher returns.", "The required rate of return on attractive office premises has fallen in pace with long-term yields, and prices have risen considerably.", "At the same time, rental prices in a number of locations are showing a downward trend.", "Large foreign capital inflows have probably contributed to the fall in the required rate of return.", "Like their counterparts in other countries, Norwegian bond-issuing enterprises and banks have over time been able to obtain cheaper funding.", "Lower risk premiums on covered bonds, for example, have reduced banks' residential mortgage funding costs.", "A low policy rate in combination with low risk premiums has resulted in low residential mortgage financing costs for households.", "Household debt has grown far faster than income.", "Low interest rates may increase the risk that debt and asset prices rise to levels that are unsustainable over time.", "Such financial imbalances could trigger or amplify an economic downturn.", "More resilient banks reduce this risk.", "Requirements with

the economy and higher unemployment at a later stage.", "Over the past year, there has been a negative turnaround in the Norwegian economy.", "Oil prices have decreased by more than 50 percent in a year.", "The fall in oil prices has amplified an expected decline in activity in the oil sector, and the Norwegian economy is experiencing a period of restructuring.", "No more than in other countries

transitional period.", "Chart: Labour costs relative to trading partners The policy rate has been cut and the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries reduced.", "Lower interest rates stimulate consumption and investment.", "The krone has depreciated markedly and has recently been at historically low levels.", "The depreciation of the krone is contributing to underpinning inflation and dampening the effects of lower oil prices on output and employment.", "Even though the cost level in Norway is still high compared with other countries, a weaker krone is strengthening the competitiveness of Norwegian firms exposed to international competition.", "At the same time, wage growth in Norway has moderated, and there are prospects that real wage growth in 2015 will be at
