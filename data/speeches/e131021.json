one related to information and the other that is often taken for granted i.e.", "I would attempt to give an overview of these aspects and their significance in the present day context.", "While covering these topics, I would touch upon the initiatives taken by the RBI in this regard, the future road map for banks and conclude posing a few questions that may be deliberated further.", "One issue that banks face is the single-version of the truth - a single representation of critical data such as customers, products, assets, that is unique, complete, and consistent, which becomes the most reliable and authoritative information for the entire bank.", "With data that is duplicated, inconsistent, incomplete, and spread in silos across disparate systems, special techniques are required to recognize (disparate data), resolve (into a single version of the truth), and relate (them to derive some meaning) the data.", "In addition to this, you would also need to persist with a single version of the truth, store the complete history of all changes, and lineage of how duplicate data has been merged.", "In banks, the fact that data is crucial to decision-making and planning is taken as given but what about its quality?", "And why is it important to have data of good quality?", "Well the answer is simple though the solution may not be.", "The answer is: we need good quality data which is reliable, available, auditable and correct to help us in taking appropriate timely decisions.", "In modern governance, the regulatory returns have acquired different significance.", "Unlike the bygone era, the returns are not merely used for tracking a bank's performance but also as forerunners for understanding market trends.", "It is this macro-prudential analysis that has gained global attention.", "But the end techno-managerial solution to achieve this is a long climb!", "Dilemma faced by banks 12.", "It is frustrating for banks when they do not see the kinds of returns generally expected from heavy investments in IT/IT enabled initiatives like the BI or CRM.", "In most of the cases, it is the data that is often put to blame.", "In most cases, banks may not be even aware of the magnitude of the problem and the criticality of the issue.", "When the identification and correction of the problem does not take place early, the risk of defective data contaminating critical information assets is very high, leading to escalation of costs, jeopardising customer relationships, and most importantly, imprecise forecasts leading to improper decisions.", "Do banks manage to give the right information?", "Before I speak on the procedures adopted by banks to produce those lucid documents which make a good reading, I am reminded of a quote of Ronald Coase, a Nobel Laureate in the field of Economics (1991), who said \"Torture the data, and it will confess to anything\", which may have a humorous connotation to some, but has a deeper meaning when we analyse the sentence.", "Do we indulge in \"torturing the data\"?", "By stretching the definition, can I interpret \"torturing the data\" as data massaging?", "Sometimes this process is also referred to as \"ETL\" meaning \"Extract, Transform, Load\".", "Massaging the data is the \"transform\" step, but it implies ad-hoc fixes that is done to smoothen out problems rather than transformations between well-known formats; but data quality can become a casualty if such transformation meanders into a mundane mechanical exercise.", "IDRBT is compiling a Handbook on \"Data Quality in Indian banking Industry: Issues, remedies and impacts\" dealing with issues relating to data quality and has suggested a new framework towards achieving this; this may prove beneficial for banks.", "Though one may be tempted to think that a term like Data Management is more apt for technologically agile sectors like IT, the truth is that good data management practices can bring a huge benefit to the banking industry as well.", "Further, the benefits arising out of this are not generic in nature, but rather deal with the core challenge today's financial industry is facing -
