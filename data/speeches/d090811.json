for over 80% of urban cooperative banks presence and 75% of their total deposits.", "Predominant concentration of Urban Cooperative Banks in these 5 states is mainly on account of emergence of strong

opportunity for the UCBs to upgrade to a computerized environment so as to focus on more business opportunities and render better customer service.", "These technological platforms provide an impetus

administrators/auditors including Chartered Accountants.", "Financial inclusion for an inclusive growth Traditionally, we have seen and observed that the poor have not been welcomed to the banking fold by the banks and financial institutions with a misconception that they are not bankable and there is no business opportunity in offering services to the under-privileged and poor people in the semi-urban rural and slum-dwellers in the metropolitan cities.", "Banks and financial institutions had been till recent times financially excluding these people on the They have no or few assets, They have nothing to offer as collateral, They have no business experiences, They cannot be trained for availing financial services, They have no credit history, and They cannot understand the nuances of banking due to illiteracy or less education.", "Given the belief that Credit is a Human Right as advocated by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, and the poor can overcome poverty by generating

insurance - enlarges livelihood opportunities and empowers the poor to take charge of their lives.", "Such empowerment aids social growth and sustainable growth of the economy.", "Apart from these benefits, Financial Inclusion imparts formal identity, provides access to the payments system and to savings safety net like deposit insurance.", "Today, we need to understand that Financial Inclusion is critical for achieving inclusive growth in the country.", "To achieve that, we have to expand our scope of financial inclusion initiatives to reach out to people at the grass-root level.", "We may consider achieving that in Through State-driven intervention by way of statutory enactments (for instance, the US example of the Community Reinvestment Act; and in France making it a statutory right to have a bank account).", "Through voluntary effort by the banking community by evolving various strategies to bring within the ambit of the banking sector the large strata of society, and more Creating a demand by the people themselves to pull the banks, financial institutions and other service providers towards them to offer banking and financial services at a competitive and affordable rate.", "This will go a long way in not only financially including and empowering the people but also as an avenue of providing excellent business opportunities for the financial market payers.", "Generally, we associate the term Financial Inclusion with our initiatives of bringing poor people in the rural areas into the banking fold; however, we have to realize that there are still a large number of people in the urban area who are financially excluded.", "They have the need for availing the various types of banking services, especially the savings and money remittance services.", "This section of financially excluded people in the urban areas provides a good opportunity for the UCBs to step in and fill this void.", "This is a challenge and a big opportunity for the UCBs at the same time; and I reiterate that if UCBs are not able to grab this excellent opportunity, new institutions will come up to fill this void and UCBs will lose a good business opportunity.", "RBI and financial inclusion RBI has been giving adequate attention and has stepped in whenever it felt that the banking community as a whole has missed out or not given the desired attention to certain areas.", "This is the reason why the Reserve Bank is placing a lot of emphasis on financial inclusion.", "In India, the focus of the financial inclusion at present has been confined to ensuring a bare minimum access to a savings bank account without frills with a limited overdraft facility to all.", "RBI has framed guidelines with a view to achieving greater financial inclusion, to make available a basic banking \"no frills\" account either with nil or very minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the population.", "The nature and number of transactions in such accounts would be restricted and made known to customers in advance in a transparent manner.", "Efforts are being made so that all banks give wide publicity to the facility of such no frills account to ensure greater financial inclusion.", "Banks and financial institutions have to take a lead here for achieving our objective of reaching out to people.", "In order to ensure that persons

for people who intend to keep balances not exceeding rupees fifty thousand (Rs.", "50,000/-) in all their accounts taken together and the total credit in all the accounts taken together is not expected to exceed rupees one lakh (Rs.,00,000/-) in a year.", "Cooperative banks and regional rural banks being local level institutions are well suited for achieving financial inclusion.", "Being local institutions they are ideally suited for achieving Financial Inclusion.", "The use of IT solutions for providing banking facilities at people's doorsteps holds the potential for scalability of the Financial Inclusion initiatives.", "Many Pilot projects have been initiated in various States using smart cards for opening bank accounts with bio-metric identification.", "Here, the link to mobile or hand held connecting device ensures that the transactions are recorded in the bank's books on real time basis.", "The outcome of these Pilot projects has been promising.", "However, we have to now ensure that the gains and lessons from these Pilot projects are translated into an achievable, affordable and implementable plans on a pan India basis to leverage the benefits of inclusive growth, otherwise all our hard work in recent years would fizzle out without many tangible benefits.", "Today, our focus should be to simplify the technology which can operate on any platform.", "The technology solution to the business needs should be user-friendly without much thirdparty or IT vendor intervention or support requirement for operating the same.", "In this context, the banks need to redesign their business strategies to incorporate specific plans to promote financial inclusion of low income group treating it both a business opportunity as well as a social responsibility.", "We can achieve our goal of inclusive growth if all the available resources including technology and expertise available with the banks, the support of the government, the optimum utilization of the Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), NGOs and Self Help Groups are geared towards including more and more people under the banking net.", "Initially, it may appear that taking banking to the sections constituting \"the bottom of the pyramid\" may not be profitable but as various study conducted reveals that even the relatively low margins on high volumes can be a profitable proposition.", "Banks therefore need to work out their appropriate business delivery models and financial products to cater to the needs of the people.", "It is important that banks should give wide publicity to the facility of no-frills account.", "Banking services need to be \"marketed\" to connect with large population segments and these may be justifiable promotional costs.", "Mobile phones, POS terminals, \"simple to use\" cash dispensing and collecting machines akin to ATMs, etc.", "with operating instructions and commands in vernacular language would greatly facilitate the financial inclusion of the semi-urban populace at an affordable cost, and cooperative banks with a local touch and feel can address these issues in a big way.", "The Reserve Bank's endeavour has been to strengthen the UCBs so that they run on sound principles without posing any systemic problems.", "Our focus is also geared towards facilitating the process of computerization in UCBs, especially those who are not yet computerized to enable them to take advantage of technology to increase business opportunities, improve customer service and increasing the coverage of its services.", "Financial Inclusion as a holistic benchmark of a country's advancement and its commitment to meet the aspirations of its disadvantaged franchisee is a \"Goal\" to pursue by all the concerned players.", "All of us, the RBI, the banks and financial institutions, the fringe players facilitating the financial inclusion process have to work hard for the sustainable inclusive growth, both social and economical.", "We indeed have an important role to play and contribute towards the development of this great nation.", "Mahesh Cooperative Urban Bank's technological initiatives will go a long way in contributing to our goal
