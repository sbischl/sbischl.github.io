particularly after the announcement of ICE's takeover bid for NYSE Euronext, which could substantially change the role of the financial centre's players and generate new opportunities.", "It is essential that efforts undertaken to consolidate and develop market infrastructures as well as market and post-trade services be intensified.", "From this point of view, 2013 will represent an important step forward with the full deployment of the offer of clearing and triparty collateral management services for repo transactions in euro that has been developed with Paris's principal financial operators, banks, clearing and settlement infrastructures and the Banque de France.", "We will also strive to take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge, particularly in the areas of services for financing, investment and settlement in increasingly international currencies (such as the renminbi) and infrastructures for enhancing market transparency (such as data warehouses for the repo market for example).", "Supporting the economy by offering financing under the best possible conditions The last point I would like to make is also crucial for economic recovery: it concerns lending to the economy.", "The downward trend that has been observed for some time is primarily due to a fall in demand.", "But we must of course ensure that the offer of financing remains sufficiently broad so that SMEs and MTEs, who rarely have access to market financing, can weather the current difficult economic period without encountering additional difficulties.", "In particular cash facilities must remain sufficiently available and the conditions under which they are offered should not be systematically tightened.", "In fact, our quarterly survey of several thousand SMEs show a regular contraction of the rate at which SMEs' requests for cash facilities are fully granted.", "In the last quarter of 2012, this rate was only slightly higher than 50%.", "The same is true, although to a lesser extent, for mid-tier enterprises (MTEs).", "I therefore enjoin you, in general terms, to avoid reducing lending to the economy, which would aggravate the situation of companies and make the necessary economic recovery more difficult."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["banking union", "Solvency II", "Basel 3", "Paris financial centre", "liquidity", "credit", "savings", "financing", "economy", "lending"]}
