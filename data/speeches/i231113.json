for Physics - in 2010.", "No, I am not saying that the research papers you will present today are trivial in any way, shape or form, but we all know that every invention, every discovery, every research project has to start somewhere.", "Just like every change has to start somewhere.", "Mostly with events- And recent years have been truly eventful.", "The euro area economy was rocked by several large shocks, -

think about investment, GDP, unemployment - will only be felt in about one year's time.", "Hence, we should be a little patient and not raise rates too much to prevent choking off the economy.", "Second, even though inflation numbers have started to decrease, the risk still remains that high inflation may become entrenched if second round effects persist or inflation expectations de-anchor.", "Therefore, we need the incoming data to continue to confirm our projections -

in fact - are reducing their balance sheet at a relatively faster pace.", "That brings me to the challenge.", "While, clearly, the current balance sheet has to shrink, our future balance sheet size may need to be larger than it was before the Global Financial crisis.", "The reason is that structural changes in financial markets, including a higher demand for liquidity, will call for a larger central bank reserves in the future.", "In my view, refinancing operations represent the most efficient tool to provide such a level of reserves down the road.", "For all these challenges, I look forward to your ideas, your expertise, your input.", "Because monetary policy is too important, too crucial for our economy and our general well-being, to rely on trial and error.", "The ECB, the central banks, would prefer to avoid the honour of receiving an Ig Nobel prize.", "Yes, in the history of the Ig Nobel prizes some were also awarded as criticism wrapped up in a blanket of satire.", "For instance, in 2009, the Ig Nobel for Economics was awarded to the directors, executives, and auditors of four Icelandic banks for demonstrating that tiny banks can rapidly mushroom into huge banks, and vice versa, and for demonstrating that similar things can happen to an entire national economy .", "So, to avoid that 'honour', we need data and research to fulfil our mandate, so that we can do the best possible job at what we must do best.", "Because in monetary policy, we cannot live by the slogan of the Ig Nobel prizes, also you didn't win a prize -
