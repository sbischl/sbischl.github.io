several reasons why globalisation has important implications both for the transmission of shocks and the conduct of monetary policy.", "Globalisation and domestic shocks While enhanced international risk-sharing should dampen the national impact of economic and financial shocks, the international mobility of factors of capital, labour, finance, firms and technologies can either amplify or dampen shocks., For instance, in relation to amplification, a boost to the domestic business environment can trigger a larger output response than in a closed economy, since the prospect of higher investment returns and higher wages draws in capital and labour from abroad.", "Conversely, a negative shock may be amplified by capital outflows and net emigration.", "In terms of cross-border financial integration, a domestic boom-bust cycle can be amplified if domestic residents take on extra foreign leverage during the upswing that then requires additional deleveraging during the downturn.", "Similarly, in relation to dampening, firms can opt to extend overseas production or switch to imported inputs if a boom triggers rising domestic cost pressures.", "In the other direction, if a recession is associated with a decline in domestic costs, the end of the recession can be brought forward by the entry of foreign firms and capital that are attracted by the improvement in the cost base.", "The dampening of the cycle is also facilitated by international financial risk-sharing, with domestic risks partly transferred to foreign investors through direct ownership and portfolio

ECB's in-house model for the euro area economy, the New Area-Wide Model II.", "In the absence of a monetary policy response, the shock to foreign demand induces substantial declines in exports, output

the second and third channels in particular may not be as straightforward as presented in textbooks.", "First, the aggregate demand channel is simply based on changes in import demand.", "Since contractionary monetary policy action curbs consumption and investment, it also entails lower demand for imports.", "This constitutes a negative demand shock for the rest of the world and is contractionary for trading partners.", "Second, the financial channel works through the effect of domestic policy on foreign financial conditions.", "One dimension of the financial channel is based on the effect of the exchange rate on the local-currency valuation of foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities.", "A country that is a net borrower on international financial markets in US dollars will experience a negative wealth effect when US monetary policy is tightened.", "This means that an exchange rate valuation wealth effect implies a contractionary monetary policy spillover.", "Such valuation effects can be particularly powerful when exchange rate fluctuations change the value of collateral denominated in foreign currency, and thereby affect borrowing and leverage.", "Again, given the dominance of the US dollar in global financial markets, spillovers from US monetary policy through this channel may be particularly sizeable.", "This channel is especially important for emerging and developing economies, as these rely more on foreign-currency funding.", "Another dimension of the financial channel operates through portfolio rebalancing.", "In particular, cross-border portfolio balance effects arise from imperfect substitutability between short and long-term bond portfolios, as well as between domestic and foreign bonds within investors' portfolios.", "Suppose that agents in each country can hold domestic and foreign short and long-term government bonds, but they cannot perfectly substitute among these four types of bonds.", "In this set-up, portfolio balance effects arise as yields react to changes in the relative supply of bonds.", "For example, a reduction in the relative supply of euro area long-term bonds due to asset purchases by the ECB leads to a decrease in long-term yields in the euro area.", "Since bond supplies directly affect the term premium, this occurs even when short-term rates are unchanged.", "In turn, the international portfolio re-balancing channel leads to a reduction in term premia and long-term yields in the rest of the world, as the ECB's asset purchases increase through portfolio rebalancing the demand for rest-of-the-world long-term bonds.", "Of course, the degree of substitutability across bonds of different maturities and origins is crucial for the magnitude of spillovers from central bank asset purchases through the portfolio re-balancing channel.", "For example, a relatively low elasticity of substitution between short- and long-term bonds implies a sizeable domestic effect of the ECB's asset purchases on term premia, whereas a relatively high elasticity of substitution between domestic and rest-of-the-world bonds is key for generating large spillovers from to rest-of-the-world term premia.", "In fact, there is empirical evidence suggesting that portfolio re-balancing is an important conduit for spillovers from central bank asset purchases in large economies.", "The financial channel of exchange rates and cross-border portfolio re-balancing are just two dimensions of a more complex of the more broadly defined financial channel of monetary policy spillovers, and quite some research - including at the ECB - is under way to shed more light on how monetary policy in systemic economies affects the rest of the world.", "Third, the traditional exchange rate channel of monetary policy spillovers operates through changes in the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods.", "A monetary policy tightening generally causes the exchange rate to appreciate.", "To the extent that the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods are affected by the exchange rate appreciation, a monetary policy tightening at home elicits expenditure switching at home and abroad.", "Expenditure switching under the exchange rate channel of monetary policy spillovers thus rotates demand at home and abroad, but where and in which direction the rotation takes place depends on a string of factors.", "Two factors that have received some attention recently are the invoicing currency of exports.", "If export prices are sticky in domestic currency, an exchange rate appreciation makes domestic goods less competitive in world markets, shifting expenditure abroad and at home away from domestic goods.", "This traditional analysis is based on the Mundellian assumption of \"producer currency pricing\" (PCP).", "Discussions about the external effects of policy actions in politics and the media are typically implicitly based on this assumption.", "In contrast, if export prices are sticky in a foreign currency, the relative price of imports and domestically produced goods in terms of the currency of the importer is not affected by the exchange rate appreciation and exchange rate pass-through is incomplete.", "In this case, monetary policy spillovers through expenditure switching are muted.", "This latter case traditionally corresponds to the setting in which export prices are sticky in the currency of the importer, referred to as \"local currency pricing\" (LCP).", "More recently, emphasis has shifted to an alternative setting, namely one in which export prices are sticky in a dominant currency regardless of the trading partners involved, in particular the US dollar.", "This setting of \"dominant currency pricing\" (DCP) has particularly important implications for the global spillovers from US monetary policy.", "The differences in monetary spillovers through expenditure switching under the exchange rate channel across these different invoicing settings can be illustrated by a scenario analysis using the structural model for the global economy used at the ECB.", "For example, a tightening in US monetary policy that is followed by a multilateral appreciation of the US dollar elicits a much stronger slowdown in global trade under DCP than under PCP (Chart 14).", "The reason is that a larger share of global trade prices is sticky in US dollars under DCP, even if the related trade does not involve the United States.", "As a result, a larger share of global imports becomes more expensive in local currency terms in response to the appreciation of the US dollar, which elicits expenditure switching from imports to domestically produced goods.", "Model simulations of the impact of a US monetary policy shock in ECB-Global (average effect over one year) Sources: Georgiadis, G. and S.
