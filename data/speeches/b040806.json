caused by the slowing of economic growth, fluctuations in share prices and the crises and collapse of major industrial groups.", "Monetary policy in the three main areas of the world has been markedly expansionary, while prices have remained largely stable.", "There has been a substantial increase in the monetary base; interest rates on loans have fallen to historical low levels.", "In the case of real-estate investment the abundance of credit has fostered price rises in excess of the increase in prices of current output; in some countries, property values have been inflated by speculation.", "The Federal Reserve's recent increase in interest rates by 25 basis points marks the start of a move to bring the cost of money in the United States back to long-term equilibrium levels, against a background of robust economic growth.", "Even after the rate increase the yield curve has a sharp upward slope everywhere, in the United States, in Europe and in Japan, pointing to market expectations that interest rates will rise substantially in coming years.", "The rise in interest rates will affect public finances, particularly in the most heavily indebted countries.", "It re-emphasizes the need for firms to ensure that costs and combinations of factors of production can guarantee the development of their activity and the growth of the economy, even with real and nominal interest rates closer to normal levels.", "The return on savings invested in financial assets will increase.", "The resilience of the banking and financial systems in the face of destabilizing forces can partly be

produce a better evaluation of credit risk for small loans.", "Intermediaries may use simplified methods for the calculation of requirements, similar to those now in force.", "Like the more complex

nearly one percentage point of GDP.", "The progressive deterioration in the accounts in the first six months of this year suggests that in the absence of corrective action general government net borrowing for the year as a whole will be 3.5 per cent of GDP, as I indicated at the Bank of Italy's Annual General Meeting on 31 May.", "The adjustment package the Government is about to adopt, amounting to some \u20ac7.5 billion or 0.6 per cent of GDP, is intended to ensure compliance with the 3 per cent limit.", "In formulating the mid-year budget, the restrictive measures must not be allowed to have a negative impact on demand at a time when the economic recovery is still halting.", "It will be necessary to monitor the effectiveness of the measures, whose application is concentrated in the coming months.", "The evolution of the public finances must be carefully verified, among other things owing to the uncertain outlook for some receipts that are an integral part of the budget for 2004 adopted at the end of last year.", "The positive outcome of the Ecofin meeting prevented a worsening of expectations.", "With a view to the publication of the Economic and Financial Planning Document, the size of Italy's public debt requires the formulation, in accordance with the political calendar of a policy for the public finances that can reconcile their consolidation with faster growth in the medium term.", "After the second half of the 1990s the public finances began to deteriorate again.", "In the last two years cyclical developments have also been a factor.", "In the last three years the containment of the budget deficit has been entrusted mainly to one-off measures, which are useful in a period of transition and sluggish economic growth; it is now necessary to return to a lasting structural reduction of the gap between expenditure and revenue.", "The primary surplus has progressively contracted; this year it is likely to be around 2 per cent of GDP, notably less than the value of 5.5 per cent set in order to participate in the Monetary Union and to ensure a significant rate of debt reduction in relation to GDP.", "The outlook for the public finances needs to be verified both for this year and for 2005.", "The expected rise in interest rates worldwide will influence interest expenditure.", "The downgrading of Italy's rating by an international rating agency is confirmation of the difficulties facing the country.", "The structural curbing of current expenditure must reduce government borrowing and provide the resources for increased public investment.", "Reducing the burden of taxation must not lead to a rise in the deficit.", "The expansionary effect produced by the growth in disposable income would be outweighed by the negative effect deriving from the increase in the debt.", "Conditions in the trade unions, firms and banks appear to be conducive to a return to growth-oriented cooperation.", "To date the contribution from the implementation of public works has been limited; it must be boosted.", "The curb on public expenditure must not penalize firms in the weakest parts of the country.", "New prospects must be created for research, for the application of advanced technologies in production and for the development of alternative energy sources.", "It is necessary to increase confidence.", "This can be done by drawing up a credible and broadly supported economic policy to reduce the absorption of savings by the State, lower (in part through faster growth) the ratio of public debt to GDP, and charts a course for progress in the years to come.", "As I also noted on 31 May, the Italian economy's loss of competitiveness is the consequence of long-term trends; partly owing to an especially difficult international environment, the deterioration has not been halted in the last few years.", "It is necessary to act on several fronts and set in motion an improvement of the factors underlying growth.", "It is necessary and possible to react, in Italy and at European level, so as to be able to participate in what promises to be a strong and prolonged recovery of the world
