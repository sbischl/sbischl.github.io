past and present - who have worked hard on creating the current environment.", "On the challenging side, in addition to maintaining the status quo, we have new and significant long-term economic challenges among which central banks operate.", "For example, in the financial system alone, we must deal with global economic inter-dependence, dominant financial institutions, significant debt burdens, technological change that challenges employment and financial inclusion norms, climate change, and much more.", "The list is long and the challenges have intergenerational implications.", "I spoke about many of these issues in a recent speech about the dangers of short-term thinking.", "The refreshed Reserve Bank Act and monetary policy practices, and the ongoing reviews of our legislation, position us to adapt to these changes.", "The aim is to ensure that the Reserve Bank can continue to achieve its fundamental purpose, which is \"to promote the prosperity and well-being of New Zealanders, and contribute to a sustainable and productive economy\".", "Institutions, Legitimacy & Identity Let's take a step back and talk about the backdrop to recent and pending changes to the Reserve Bank's frameworks.", "The key role of a public institution is to bring to life the terms of a contract that arises between society and its representative government.", "This 'social contract' will always evolve, with its terms negotiated via the democratic process.", "Orr, A., (2018), Geopolitics, New Zealand and the Winds of Change, Reserve Bank of New Zealand speech delivered to the \"Shaping Futures National Conference\" Financial Services Council in Auckland, 7 September 2018 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act (1989).", "Institutions must therefore adapt in keeping with shifting political, economic, environmental, and social realities, so as to serve the well-being of the people.", "After all, it is from people that institutions derive their 'social license' to operate -

uncertain growth and continued low nominal interest rates - against inflated central bank balance sheets, and the ever-present threat of asset price bubbles.", "More specifically, as a small, open economy New Zealand is especially vulnerable to downturns in its trading partner economies.", "And with a high reliance on banks for overseas borrowing, we are vulnerable to the transmission of
