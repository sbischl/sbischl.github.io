Rangarajan) the Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System(LERMS) involving dual exchange rate mechanism was instituted in March 1992 which was followed by the ultimate convergence of the dual rates effective from March 1, 1993(christened modified LERMS).", "The unification of the exchange rate of the rupee marks the beginning of the era of market determined exchange rate regime of rupee, based on demand and supply in the forex market.", "It is also an important step in the progress towards current account convertibility, which was finally achieved in August 1994 by accepting Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.", "The appointment of an Expert Group on Foreign Exchange (popularly known as Sodhani Committee) in November 1994 is a landmark in the design of foreign exchange market in India.", "The Group studied the market in great detail and came up with far reaching recommendations to develop, deepen and widen the forex market.", "In the process of development of forex markets, banks have been accorded significant initiative and freedom to operate in the market.", "To quote a few important measures relating to market development and liberalisation, banks were allowed freedom to fix their trading limits, permitted to borrow and invest funds in the overseas markets up to specified limits, accorded freedom to determine interest

makes a distinction among the different participants in order to assess, on an ongoing basis, the gains as well as the vulnerabilities of foreign currency exposures to the system.", "In the capital account, apart from the Government's, there are three balance sheets that we take into account whether for residents or for non-residents : the balance sheet of the households, the corporates and the financial intermediaries.", "Although in theory, everything may be integrated, in our phase of development, definitely these three are distinct in terms of their immediate reactions to market forces.", "In particular, this approach recognises the need to put in place appropriate prudential regulation in regard to the financial intermediaries in so far as foreign currency transactions are concerned.", "There is virtual unanimity that the currency mismatches of financial intermediaries is a major source of risks of financial integration which has to be mitigated by monitoring and regulations and furthermore, that currency mismatches in the corporate sector can also be a source of risk to the financial sector.", "Hence the advice to banks to monitor unhedged exposures of borrowers.", "I would rejig your memory a bit - at the Ninth Forex Assembly at Goa, the then Deputy Governor Dr.S.S.", "Tarapore had alluded to these risks saying \"banks and FIs cannot distance themselves from the risks taken by corporates as these risks can involuntarily devolve on the banks as their lendings to corporates can easily turn into NPAs\".", "Prudential regulations in the financial sector should not therefore be construed as capital controls.", "This approach has been reflected in the recent liberalisation of the policy on external commercial borrowings.", "The whole process of permitting such external debt may be either through the automatic route or non-automatic route, but slowly the automatic route is being expanded and the non-automatic route reduced.", "The recent External Commercial Borrowing(ECB) policy makes clear distinction between corporates and financial intermediaries.", "Therefore, while corporates have been given freedom to borrow under
