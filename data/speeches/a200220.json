uncertainty, investors - reading our rate guidance - tend to anticipate a more extended period of time to the date of a rate hike.", "By the chained structure of our forward indications of all instruments, this automatic adjustment mechanism extends the horizons for full reinvestments too, and thus reinforces the impact of rate guidance on longer-term interest rates.", "Moreover, our new
