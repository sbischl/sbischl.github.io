Central Banks shall be to maintain price stability\".", "Price stability, combined with the convergence of euro area economies, is the key issue enabling the euro to become a stable international currency.", "\u2022 Thanks to a strong macroeconomic framework and to the convergence of euro area economies, the introduction of the euro has limited the risks of disequilibrium inside the euro area (Part 1).", "Furthermore, the international role of the euro as a vector of stability has increased (Part 2).", "Part 1: The euro has been a key factor for maintaining stability inside the euro area

stability, it will aim to maintain inflation rates close to, but below, 2% over the medium-term.", "The monetary policy conducted by the Eurosystem has led to a low level of inflation, which averaged 2% between 1999 and 2004, and to very favorable financing conditions as both short-term and long-term interest rates have reached very low levels.", "Moreover, in principle, fiscal policies cannot undermine the objective of price stability as the Treaty prohibits monetary financing and as Member States are committed to implementing the Stability and Growth Pact.", "However, the lack of fiscal discipline in some euro area countries and the recent debate at the EU level have illustrated the fact that it is still necessary to enhance the efficiency of the European fiscal framework and, especially, to strengthen the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which deals with the surveillance of budgetary positions.", "The fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and, thus, of central importance to the cohesion of Monetary Union itself.", "B The introduction of the euro

synchronization of business cycles have increased since the introduction of the euro Regarding business cycles, some recent work presented by a working group joining the CEPR (Centre for Economic Policy Research) and the Eurosystem shows that the correlation between business cycles as a whole and also consumption and investment in most euro area countries has increased since 1999.", "A common European component seems to play a more important role in these economies than the national components do.", "The degree of correlation between national cycles and the euro area aggregated cycle varies between 0.70 and 0.92.", "Concerning inflation, the research conducted by the Eurosystem shows that the degree of dispersion of inflation rates inside the euro area is not significantly superior to that observed in the USA, where the federal budget and the much more unified market of goods and services constitute additional room for manoeuvre.", "The standard error of the annual growth of prices in the 12 euro area countries is in the vicinity of 1.1, compared with 0.8 in the 14 regions of the USA.", "\u2022 Finally, the updating of the vast work on led by the monetary transmission mechanisms Eurosystem shows that Member States' economies are more homogeneous as regards the transmission of monetary impulses since the introduction of the euro.", "The EMU has limited

of a stable environment characterized by historically low interest rates.", "Thanks to these developments, the euro area countries have not been confronted with difficulties stemming from the uncertainties due to recent geopolitical troubles.", "\u2022 The introduction of the euro has catalyzed the financial integration of the European economy, which is totally complete as regards the

technical rules.", "Part 2: The euro plays the role of an international currency and a nominal anchor The available data bear out the increase in the international role of the euro.", "At the regional level, it plays a significant role as an anchor and is the vector of a culture of stability.", "The increasing role of the euro at the international level is due to the development of its use as a financial instrument and as a medium of exchange (A) and of its role as an anchor for exchange rate regimes (B).", "A The euro is an essential financial instrument and a key medium of exchange \u00b7 \u2022 The use of the euro as a financing and an investment currency on the capital markets has increased.", "In the first half of 2004, the euro accounted for almost 36% of the gross issuance of long-term international debt securities, compared with 24% in 2002.", "Another significant development is the emergence of a corporate bond market in the euro area, whose volume has increased significantly in the last few years.", "The outstanding amount of quoted shares issued by euro area residents was EUR 4,035 billion in 2004 as against EUR 3,118 billion in 2002.", "As a settlement currency, the role of the euro is expanding.", "In 2003, between 50% and 60% of goods and services traded between the euro area countries and the rest of the world were settled in euro.", "This is true for both exports and imports.", "In countries where the use of the euro as a medium of exchange is highly significant, such as the Central and Eastern European Countries, 60% to 80% of exports

with 63.8% for the dollar) but the share of the euro has increased significantly (it stood at 12.6% in 1999).", "This is an important factor of protection for many countries with regard to strong

these countries, so long as they pursue appropriate policies at the same time.", "In contrast to the domestic role of a currency, which is strongly determined by institutions, the international role of a currency is market driven.", "This explains why the different uses of money proceed at different speeds.", "The fact that many countries outside the euro area have rapidly decided to link their exchange rate regimes to the euro illustrates the fact that they consider the euro to be an international factor of stability due to the stabilizing role it has played and still plays in the euro
