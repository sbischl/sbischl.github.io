growth: 1.", "A macroeconomic policy geared towards stability, 2. a structural policy geared towards growth, and 3. a sound financial sector.", ".1 Macroeconomic policy: stability orientation Let me start with my core business as a central banker: price stability.", "Price stability is the best way a central bank can contribute to steady growth.", "Any market economy relies on prices to signal relative scarcity or abundance to market participants.", "That way, resources are channelled to their most productive uses.", "A well-functioning price mechanism therefore is a precondition for efficiency and thus for a high standard of living.", "Frequent and large movements in the price level tend to disguise movements in relative prices; they tend to block information.", "It becomes more difficult for market participants to tell the difference between overall price rises and changes in relative prices.", "Stability in the general price level is a necessity for a market economy to function properly and for investors to make the right decisions.", "To sum it up, price level stability is invaluable for growth.", "A crisp and clear stability orientation of monetary policy therefore is the No 1 foundation for sustainable growth.", "Price stability is a good only central banks can deliver.", "The Maastricht Treaty, which established European monetary union, reflects this

interference.", "The Governing Council of the ESCB has defined price stability as an annual increase in the general price level of 2% or less.", "During the run-up to EMU, countries notorious for

notes and coins came into circulation (in January 2002), people were in a rage.", "This is a good indication of how deep the newly-won stability consensus in Europe already runs.", "Never before has there been so much price stability in Europe as during the last decade.", "However, price stability is not unique to Europe.", "Disinflation occurred on a global scale, as price stability has been recognised as the superior concept of monetary policy.", "No major economy or economic bloc is willing to go back to inflationary habits.", "In this respect, the prospects for the world economy are highly favourable.", "The European stability consensus aims at underpinning price stability with an equally stability-oriented fiscal policy.", "EU governments therefore agreed on the European Stability and Growth Pact.", "The idea of the Pact is to not only to promote stability by preventing the emergence of conflicts between monetary policy and fiscal policies.", "Sound public finances as envisioned by the Pact contribute to sustainable growth, for they foster confidence.", "The pact provides a credible framework designed to automatically stabilise the economy over the business cycle.", "The budget should be balanced over the course of the cycle, allowing for deficits if necessary, but also calling for surpluses if growth is high.", "The overall debt level of the public sector must be sustainable.", "We regard the Stability and Growth Pact framework as a major improvement compared with discretionary stimulus packages that in the past have all-too-often proved to be ill-timed and debt-propelling.", "The much-chided euro-area social security systems are the main tools of automatic stabilisation.", "Calls to revise the pact to counter its alleged procyclicality lead astray.", "Counter to conventional wisdom, the pact is flexible.", "It even allows for large macroeconomic stimulus.", "The only problem with the pact is that some governments wish to apply it asymmetrically: they are willing to run deficits in a weak growth environment, but wish to dodge consolidation in times of budgetary abundance.", "This deficit bias is the very reason for the 3%-of-GDP deficit limit.", "The ongoing debate is the best evidence of how important the 3% ceiling deficit is.", "I am well aware that in the field of fiscal policy, the US and the euro area have recently started to pursue diverging approaches.", "One might even be tempted to speak of a \"global experiment\".", "Policies on both sides of the Atlantic aim at rebuilding confidence, though the paths vary.", "While you in the US trust fiscal stimulus to actively rouse the economy from its current stupor, euro-area governments are basically trying to stick to the planned fiscal consolidation paths in order not to undermine hard-won confidence in their stability-oriented fiscal policies.", ".2 Structural policy: growth orientation So, if macroeconomic policies need to be geared towards stability, then who is responsible for growth?", "It's economic policy makers' business to design a framework conducive to growth in which enterprises can thrive.", "Pro-growth policies are multi-faceted, but at the end of the day you must get the incentives right: incentives to invest and incentives to work.", "The dissatisfying growth performance of Europe owes much to its inflexible labour markets.", "Labour market policy in the EU is a responsibility of the national governments.", "Some countries like the Netherlands have successfully improved the framework for their labour markets and already brought down unemployment.", "Other countries like my own are still in the middle of an extensive debate as to how best to address the labour market issue.", "The Chancellor has recently laid out his ideas, and they seem to be going in the right direction.", "However, the crucial details for most measures still have to be worked out.", "So what I can tell you today is a bit tentative, but it is nevertheless encouraging.", "In Germany, the combination of high labour costs and generous welfare benefits had, over time, crowded out an entire segment of the labour market: low-wage jobs for the low-skill group.", "Like in other countries, this is the group with the highest unemployment rate.", "We are now pondering to adjust the incentive structure on the supply side by revamping the schemes of unemployment benefits and welfare assistance.", "A new type of \"mini-jobs\" with lower-than-usual payroll taxes is intended to help reinvigorate that labour market segment.", "Like other countries in Europe, Germany will need to tolerate a higher degree of wage differentiation.", "Wage negotiations, centralised up to now, will in the future become more open to company-specific deals.", "This increase in differentiation is a crucial feature of pro-growth policies.", "Labour contracts in general will have to become more diverse.", "More extensive use of fixed-term contracts will be allowed for expanding small businesses, thus abolishing a major impediment to small business growth.", "Another core task in growth-spurring labour market reform will be to bring down non-wage labour costs, which are a major barrier to employment growth.", "That is equivalent to further reforming the social security systems.", "We have already added a small but fully-funded pillar to our pay-as-you-go pension system.", "However, pension reform is still unfinished business.", "Employees will need to resort to more private provisioning.", "In terms of growth orientation, Europe has been a bit of a laggard, although we have sound economic fundamentals.", "The time for more structural adjustments has undoubtedly come.", "They should help to both exploit and raise the growth potential.", "In general, economic policymakers need to provide a viable framework for giving enterprises and house-holds certainty of planning.", "Pro-growth policies are not restricted to domestic issues.", "A coherent approach to pro-growth policies must encompass liberal trade policy.", "Lowering barriers to trade and granting market access must be part of any credible set of pro-growth policies.", "There are really few things economists are willing to agree on, but the benefits of free trade are among them.", "Therefore, the Doha round of international trade negotiations is another great opportunity for the world economy to foster growth.", ".3 A sound financial system The third factor in policies for sustainable growth is a sound financial system.", "It is a necessary precondition for the exploitation of the growth potential.", "There can be no investment without financing, and there can be no proper financing without a sound financial sector.", "It is not a question of whether a financial system is a capital market system or relies more on banks for the allocation of funds.", "By tradition, continental Europe tends to be more bank-centred than the English-speaking countries.", "This tradition is now under change.", "Not even the setback for financial markets which followed the bursting of the millennium bubble brought this process to a halt.", "Under the new single currency, capital markets in the euro area have begun to play a larger role in financing.", "Financial integration is - aside from price stability - one of the hopes we had for the euro.", "More liquid and more thoroughly integrated euro-area capital markets are providing businesses with better and more diverse financing options.", "Ever more companies are going straight to the market, implying a changing role for banks.", "The euro-area financial system is becoming more balanced.", "Finance in Europe - which has not been bad before the euro arrived!", "- achieved a structural improvement.", "The foundations for economic growth in the euro area have improved in step.", "To safeguard the soundness of a financial system is a rather complicated task.", "Effective financial regulation and financial supervision are key to financial stability.", "As financial products become ever more complex, financial regulators and supervisors need to keep pace with developments in the capital markets.", "They have to strike a fine balance.", "Their core task is to make sure that financial institutions are capitalised commensurate to their respective risk profiles, not least in order to contain systemic risk.", "On the other hand, they do not want to hinder the development and the use of new instruments and will therefore try to permit as much room as possible so as not to hinder growth.", "In the aftermath of the late nineties' financial market boom, new questions arose.", "The role of market integrity has been highlighted by a series of financial scandals.", "Cases of insider trading, of investment banks recommending clients' stocks against their better judgement, and even some spectacular cases of outright accounting fraud have shaken financial markets to the core.", "Trust has been lost on a grand scale.", "It needs to be rebuilt by improving the framework of the markets.", "Financial markets must be trustworthy; only then will investors be willing to provide finance.", "Let me cite one last aspect of sound financial systems.", "It is also a matter of trust.", "The infrastructure of the markets needs to be stable and able to withstand shocks.", "9/11 was a shock not least to the world financial system.", "It put payment systems to the test.", "With a little help from the central banks - we stood ready to provide liquidity - the international financial system proved resilient.", "Disruptions in the world financial net might easily have a severe negative impact on the world economy.", "Hence the robustness of the market infra-structure is a major factor in steady and sustainable growth.", "Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, Uncertainty currently weighs on all debates on economic issues.", "It is a feature we will have to live with for some more time, as its causes are many.", "We can and we should, however, work to improve the resilience of the world economy.", "World economic growth needs to become better balanced.", "For this to happen, each of the world's major economic zones has some homework to do.", "Let me again point out how happy I am to be able to be here with you this afternoon to discuss some important issues of the world economy.", "Trans-Atlantic debate has traditionally been intense - and it is a tradition I hold in high esteem.", "Our countries do have differences on vital
