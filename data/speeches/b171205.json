discuss three areas where the Bank of England has made progress recently and is seeking to make further progress in the period ahead: communication; conversation; and education.", "(a) Communication When I first arrived at the Bank of England, I was told I would need to learn a new language.", "It was not one I had come across previously.", "There was no book from which to learn, nor any recorded

helped.", "The language was called \"Bankese\".", "Despite its obscurity, the semantic principles of Bankese were easy to detect.", "The language was ruthlessly consistent in tone and content, for fear of giving mixed messages.", "It was free from personal judgement, for fear of calling into question the Bank's judgement.", "It was free from emotion, for fear of Bank's objectivity.", "And it was free from split infinitives, for fear of the wrath of the Bank's wordsworths.", "This reign of semantic terror is, fortunately, now long gone.", "In its communications, the Bank no longer backs a single horse, notable for its consistency, lack of emotion and technical prowess.", "Instead it has invested in a diverse stable of styles and publications.", "The messages they deliver are now deliberately mixed, in tone and content, to meet the mixed needs of a mixed audience.", "Let me give three recent examples.", "the Bank's staff blog.", "Bank Underground The first is Bank Underground, has levels of linguistic complexity up to 4 years lower than the Inflation Report, making it accessible to up to 11 million more people, or around a fifth of the adult population.", "Perhaps reflecting that, it recently exceeded 1 million hits.", "That is around 6 or 7 times the number of readers of the Inflation Report over the same period.", "A second is KnowledgeBank.", "This is an attempt to explain the economy and central bank policies using a combination of simple prose, cartoons, videos, games and competitions.", "It draws on different messaging conveyed through different media.", "Its level of linguistic complexity is 5 years lower than the Inflation Report, making it accessible to around 14 million more people, or around a quarter of the adult population.", "A third example is the Bank's flagship publication, the Inflation Report.", "In November, the Bank for the first in three layers: Layer 3 was the usual \"50 page, 50 chart\" version; Layer 2 was time published the Report the chart\" version; and Layer 1 was the \"1 line, 1 chart\" version.", "\"1-2 page, 1-2 With a level of complexity more than 6 years below Layer 3, Layers 1 and 2 in principle could reach an extra 21 million people.", "Early evidence suggests this layering has helped in reaching a broader audience.", "Website hits on the November Inflation Report were double the average from earlier quarters.", "These extra hits were entirely accounted for by Layers 1 and 2, while Layer 3 hits were essentially unchanged.", "This suggests that layering has enabled the MPC to reach a new, wider audience without cannibalising its existing audience.", "Producing simplified material, like layering, is neither a short cut nor an easy option.", "Nor is it simply an act of communication.", "Message simplification is an act of policy.", "As such, simplified messages need to be agreed - the Layer 1 and 2 messages in the Bank's November Inflation and signed-off by policy committees as were Report.", "They are another example of the Marshall McLuhan maxim of the medium becoming the message.", "If one feature of more effective communication with the general public is simplification, a second is story-telling.", "For most people, stories stick in a way facts and figures simply cannot.", "Recent experimental evidence has explored whether media narratives are able to stick in a way that can reshape public discourse, public opinion and public behaviour.", "It finds compelling evidence that stories do just that.", "Some stories are, of course, more adhesive than others.", "I recently attended a conference on the merits of \"Odyssean\" and \"Delphic\" forward guidance.", "The use of Greek mythology is an example of story-telling.", "But are these stories sticky with the public?", "For most people, fictional goings-on in Ancient Greece several millennia ago are not especially sticky.", "Even modern-day citizens of Delphi might find them a stretch.", "in creating not just narratives but \"popular narratives\", to use the language of George Akerlof and stories that link to people's Robert Shiller.", "One effective way of doing so is draw on personal, local or recent experience.", "This helps people to visualise the story which, in turn, helps make it stick, in much the same way visualising a list of random items helps them stick in your memory.", "The MPC's decision to raise Bank Rate in November may also of course have had a role to play in generating extra hits.", "MPC's policy actions in \"taking foot off the accelerator\" The November were described as its to hold the car within its \"speed limit\".", "This was intended to convey the sense of monetary policy slowing the economy slightly, towards its lower potential growth rate, while still propelling it forward overall.", "It was a visual narrative.", "Because most people (from Derry to Doncaster, Dunfermline to Dunvant, Delphi to Delhi) drive cars, it was a local and personal narrative too.", "The car metaphor was used extensively by UK media.", "There is a balance to be struck here, of course, a point beyond which simplification and story-telling morphs into dumbing-down and trivialisation.", "We need to recognise those limits.", "Equally, most of the policymaking world is at present some distance from these limits.", "In the transition, I'd be comfortable erring on the side of over-simplifying, rather than over-complicating, if policymakers and the public are to begin to forge a link.", "Let me give a concrete example: Quantitative Easing or QE.", "When QE was first introduced in 2009, the Bank made strenuous efforts to explain this new policy to the wider world.", "It published speeches and articles.", "It even did a Townhall tour of the UK to explain its actions.", "The conversations with the public about QE typically took the following form: Q: \"Is QE please?\"", "Bank: \"QE is not printing money.", "It is the Bank of England, through its operations in financial markets, purchasing government securities of a given duration, typically from non-bank financial institutions such as life insurance and pension funds, whose accounts are credited with the proceeds such that the asset purchases are financed through the creation of central bank reserves held on the accounts of commercial banks at the Bank of England\".", "And that explanation, it was hoped, would provide the general public with the confidence needed to encourage them to spend.", "You can be the jury in deciding how well this might have been achieved.", "There was a different explanation, and conversation, with the public that could have been had.", "It might have gone something like this: money-printing?\"", "And when you get some, make sure you spend it.\"", "I fully accept that this would be the wrong side of the over-simplifying line for some people.", "But if doing so delivers the desired policy outcome - building public confidence to support spending - that may be the better side of the line on which to err.", "(b) Conversation At the Bank's first Open Forum in 2015, Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said something that has stuck with me.", "In a panel discussion on the role of finance in society, all panellists agreed on the need for improved public understanding of finance.", "Gillian added a crucial qualifier: improved understanding of the public by those in finance was every bit as important as improved public understanding of finance.", "I think this is bang on and not just in the field of finance.", "Listening is every bit as important as talking when it comes to public policy.", "The most important reason for this is the most obvious as policymakers, we stand to learn something.", "Indeed, because the voices of non-experts are rarely heard and are likely to convey different information than that available from experts, we potentially stand to learn a lot.", "This is not just conjecture.", "Statistical studies, drawn from a great many different environments and involving very different decisions, show it to be the case.", "Expert opinion is an essential starting point for good decision-making.", "But only a starting point.", "The judgements of experts can be improved materially by drawing on the views of non-experts.", "Doing so is the key to what Philip Tetlock calls \"super-forecasting.\"", "More fundamentally, non-experts are us.", "By numbers, if not salaries, they represent almost all of society.", "Non-experts do most of the spending and saving in the economy, shaping its growth.", "It is their wage and inflation expectations that determine whether central banks meet their inflation targets.", "And it is their trust that needs to be nurtured, and recaptured, if policy institutions are to maintain their legitimacy.", "Yet extracting views on the economy from non-experts is not easy.", "It takes extra effort to engage with those with whom you may be unfamiliar.", "Often they speak a different language and have different starting points.", "Sometimes, for understandable reasons, economic matters are not especially interesting for them.", "The thing that makes these views worth listening to is the very thing that makes them sometimes difficult to hear.", "One way of listening to the public is through structured surveys of households.", "Central banks, including the Bank of England, make extensive and increasing use of such surveys for example, when gauging households' indebtedness, spending and confidence.", "They play an important diagnostic role when setting policy.", "Surveys are not, however, without problems.", "One of the most important is that they use pre-determined sets of questions which may experts' views.", "If so, survey responses are likely to offer a restricted, often distorted, window on the non-expert world.", "Framed questions make for answers which conceal more than they reveal.", "One of the reasons experts have been surprised by how non-experts have behaved recently is because they have been asking closed questions or, worst of all, dismissing answers that do not fit their own view.", "Avoiding this risk requires you to ask questions which are as open and unpolluted as possible by priors and prejudices.", "This comes from listening, rather than just hearing.", "It comes from engaging in two-way conversation, from genuine dialogue not monologue.", "It comes from drawing on social skills every bit as much as cognitive skills.", "Other professions offer an object lesson here.", "Why are doctors top of the trust league table?", "Studies show that what matters for doctors' patient satisfaction scores is not just their clinical competence.", "Indeed, their knowledge of the latest Lancet article is irrelevant.", "What matters every bit as much, or more, to trust in their doctor is their social skills, their listening skills, their personal touch, their bedside manner.", "Few people would want an economist at their bedside.", "An economist with strong social skills is one who stares at your shoes, rather than their own, when engaged in polite conversation.", "And conversation does not appear to come easily to the economics profession.", "A recent study of Twitter behaviour found that economists were the least likely discipline to engage in general conversation, on topics such as Fluffy Labradors.", "Their conversations are technical in nature and narrow in reach.", "The Bank has recently re-oriented fundamentally its outreach programme to improve its engagement with non-expert audiences, with a less technical focus and a longer reach.", "Agents around the UK have for many years collected intelligence on the economy and financial system, largely from companies.",

charities, citizen and faith groups to engage with new sets of people across the whole of the UK.", "These are, by design, listening events.", "The main messages are captured in my blog and animations and photos from each of the events.", "The Townhalls have made clear to me the benefits of asking open questions, uncontaminated by priors and prejudices.", "They have taught me a lot about the economic and financial issues that really matter to people, captured by economists' only some of which are theories and surveys.", "They have underlined for me the Whittaker (2017), for example, found that patients were willing to wait longer for an appointment with a doctor with good listening skills.", "Available from the Bank's website at benefits of harnessing non-expert opinion when it comes to understanding the economy.", "And the Townhall visits, while not making me a super-forecaster, have thereby hopefully made me a slightly less bad one.", "These Townhall visits are also an eye-opener for anyone in any doubt about the importance of the economy and economic policy to the everyday lives of most people.", "When someone tells you that a higher cost of living is, for them,

numbers have swelled, by around 70%, over the past ten years.", "That remains only 4.3% of the total number of young people in this age range.", "Beyond 18, at university and college level, student numbers in economics have also been rising rapidly, with the number graduating reaching 9,000 in 2016/17, a rise of over a third in the past six years ago.", "This has increased the fraction of university-level students taking economics to over 2%, similar to subjects such as politics and accountancy.", "It is still of course only a tiny 1% of the total population in this age range.", "If we look in greater detail at just who is taking economics, the selectivity bias is more acute still.", "At ages 16 to 18, around 22% of economics students are drawn from independent schools, more than double their population averages.", "At university, around a fifth of economics students are drawn from independent schools.", "So not only are economics student numbers pretty small, they have a heavy socio-economic slant.", "The same may well be true of other subjects.", "PSHE Association (2017), Practitioner Survey Perhaps reflecting that, there is strong support among parents for PSHE having statutory status (PHSE Association, Parent Survey).", "There are also strong gender and ethnicity biases in the study of economics.", "There are discussed in, for example, Crawford, Davies and Smith (forthcoming), Tenreyro (2017) and Blackaby and Frank (2000).", "Economics also appears to have a heavy regional slant, probably for related reasons.", "The fraction of students from London studying economics between ages 14 and 18 is roughly twice the national average.", "A student from the North-East of England, where I was born, is around five times less likely to study economics than one born in London.", "The fraction of the population of the North-East who is likely never to have had any education in economics could be as high as 98%, similar to levels in Wales and Northern Ireland.", "This is a \"good news/bad news\" story.", "There are encouraging signs that economics is gaining in popularity in the upper tiers of the educational pyramid.", "But this pyramid is widest towards the top and narrow at the bottom, with a pronounced (societal and regional) slant.", "Such a structure is unlikely to be a strong and stable educational foundation for most people.", "Little wonder economics is perceived as remote and elitist.", "Perhaps a reasonable question to ask and even if it is unreasonable I am going to ask it anyway is why the essentials of the economy and finance are seen as so much less essential than literacy and numeracy.", "Is financial literacy so different than general literacy, in its impact on people's lives and everyday decision-making, that it justifies such a different educational pyramid?", "said: \"Be the change you want to see in the world\".", "I love Gandhi is often claimed to have that quote.", "Through its public understanding role, there is change the Bank can effect in the area of economics education.", "Recently, it has begun doing so.", "The Bank has been working with the organisation 'We Are Futures' to develop material on the economy to be taught in schools to children aged 11-16.", "The aim is to help create that missing foundation stone in the economics educational pyramid.", "programme is called EconoME.", "As its name suggests, EconoMe aims to link the economy and financial system to people's everyday lives; it is everyday economics.", "It seeks to give economics the same characteristics as sticky stories local, personal, topical.", "Trial materials are available for teachers now.", "The programme will be fully launched in Spring 2018, with a state schools focus.", "Over time, we will seek to broaden the schools coverage and develop materials for 16-18 year olds.", "To help with this roll-out, the Bank is increasing significantly the numbers of school visits it undertakes, with a target of 200 in 2018.", "We are working with the charities Speakers for Schools and Inspiring the Future to achieve that objective, again with a focus on state schools.", "Importantly, these visits will not just include the brass, but staff at every level.", "From personal experience, I know just how important and uplifting (at least for the speaker) these visits can be.", "They are also the best media-training I have ever encountered, with performance feedback that is instant and brutal.", "As discussed by Morton (2011), this quote is widely attributed to Gandhi but is likely a case of paraphrasing his actual words.", "Specifically, the PSHE component of the curriculum.", "These and other initiatives were discussed at the Future Forum hosted by the Bank in Liverpool a couple of weeks ago.", "The Bank has for a long time run a schools competition, Target 2.0.", "This had many virtues, but diversity was not one of them.", "In the 16 years the competition ran, independent

Camera, Action\" playing field.", "In its first year, this attracted 106 entries, with 80% of participating schools from the state sector.", "A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a school in one of the poorest towns in the UK indeed, one of the poorest in the EU.", "The school had a \"Needs Improvement\" rating from Ofsted.", "It had had 50% - that's five, zero teacher turnover the previous year.", "The children attending were from poor backgrounds and had very low academic and career aspirations.", "I knew this was going to be a tough gig.", "I ran through my material - why the economy mattered to them, what the Bank did for a living, what I did for a living etc.", "It was going about as well as I could have expected.", "There were plenty of attentive eyes and walked out.", "\"This is working\", I told myself.", "59 minutes into the one hour talk, I alert expressions.", "No-one took a final question from a girl on the far-right in the front row.", "It is seared on my soul.",

success of outreach initiatives, Bank's.", "Not engaging everyone is no reason not to try to engage someone.", "It increases the chances of two tomorrow and three the day after.", "The power of social networks, popular narratives and epidemics in expectations means you may be only one click from critical mass.", "The Bank will not reach everyone, every day of their lives.", "Nor does it need to, given what we do for a living.", "People have more important things to do in their lives than think about interest rates and bank regulation, about price and financial stability.", "Or at least I hope they have.", "Indeed, central banks would be failing in their job if people were spending too much of their lives thinking or worrying about these issues.", "Nonetheless, the actions of central banks are important for most people at key decision points in their lives.", "At those points, a trusting and understanding relationship between the central bank and the public matters.", "It matters for
