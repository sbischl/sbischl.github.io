importance of embracing financial inclusion.", "In 2005, the United Nations Development Programme estimated that around 6.5 million Pacific Islanders and 80 percent of low income people1 did not have

role in the Pacific.", "In its vision statement, it says that \"...the Network shall be committed to improving quality of life through the provision of inclusive and sustainable micro financial

days in our countries.", "The time from intervention to realising the full impact is yet to materialise on a wide scale, however, it is important to ensure that the benefits filter through.", "Having indicators linking the various phases to the ultimate benefits of individual disposable income and country income, is important and must be put in place.", "In Fiji we have only just started to document financial inclusion indicators to cover access and usage, but our goal must be to link the indicators to show the effects or impact on individual income and country income as a result of financial inclusion.", "Progress in Fiji Ladies and Gentlemen, I know there will be a special case study session on Financial Inclusion in Fiji on Thursday, where our recent experiences will be

countries representing over 75 percent of the world's unbanked population have supported the declaration and Fiji is one of them.", "This award given to Fiji simply confirms that, though we are small island nations, we can be voted ahead of the bigger nations because of what we believe in and how we set ourselves up to achieving our goals.", "I would just like to say that this award does not belong to the Reserve Bank, but to all the committed stakeholders, (those individuals, financial institutions, agencies, authorities, NGOs and donors) that we have working with us.", "We are a model
