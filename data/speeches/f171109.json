the total banking system's over-all compliance with these requirements.", "Trust Builds Relationships Relationships are often tested, and when relationships survive potential and actual threats, they rise nearer and nearer to the level of BFF status.", "Right now, the industry is facing rising competition from large banks, foreign banks and even non-banks.", "This will impact the way you price

banks, including rural banks, to provide relevant financing programs, and to become reliable partners of micro, small, and medium enterprises.", "This question can very well be extended to include individuals, farmers, and fisher-folk.", "In the BSP, we believe that to uplift marginalized segments, the answer should not be framed purely from a financing standpoint.", "For one, these sectors are unable to reach their full potential due to a range of barriers.", "These involve low productivity and efficiency, the inability to adapt processes to different stages of business growth, a lack of investments in technology, and challenges in gaining market access.", "In this regard, we support a whole-of-government approach.", "For example, the Department of Trade and Industry talks about the 7Ms of successful entrepreneurs.", "The BSP, given its natural mandate specifically focuses on one of the Ms, which is the money side of it...", "In this regard, we believe that barriers to financial

this flexibility to design customized credit products and reduce the focus on collateral in providing credit.", "The BSP is not requiring banks to demand collateral from borrowers.", "Rather, the regulations put forward that banks improve their understanding of clients' businesses, conduct meaningful credit and cash flow analysis, and use good judgment in gauging ability and willingness to pay.", "If we get this right, this will address a fundamental issue since small businesses and individual borrowers especially in the agricultural sector often lack real estate collateral even if they have adequate sources of repayment.", "Another approach we have taken is to support efforts to build financial infrastructure and viable ecosystems that will sustain lending to micro and small businesses.", "This includes establishment of a credit information system, efficient secured transaction registries and a wellrun credit guarantee system.", "The BSP is working on all these fronts and will continue to engage and support these important initiatives.", "Recently, we also issued guidelines on agricultural value chain financing (VCF) to facilitate credit to the agriculture sector.", "This opens up credit provision to all the players in an organized value chain.", "This Framework aims to promote VCF as an effective, organized means of channeling funds to the agri-fisheries sector, promoting their financial inclusion.", "By encouraging linkages among various players in an agri-value chain, the credit risk of participating smallholder farmers and fisher-folk can be reduced and facilitate their access to more credit.", "The BSP is likewise conducting a VCF study on various SME sectors.", "The study aims to identify various VCF models for SMEs that work in the Philippines, explore potential regulatory incentives to further encourage SME financing and other types of support to various levels or players in the SME value chain, and enable SMEs to be financially included and enjoy the benefits of participating in the value chain.", "We continue to pursue financial inclusion initiatives to make banking services more accessible.", "Part of our strategy is the deepening of financial education and consumer protection initiatives, as well as leveraging technology to have greater scale in banking.", "Further, we hope that the industry can already take advantage of recent rules allowing banks to use third party cash agents as a cost-efficient service delivery channel.", "Also, the BSP has reduced the Know-Your-Customer rules for certain low-risk accounts, including the use of technology to facilitate frictionless customer on-boarding.", "Digital Financial Inclusion As mentioned at the onset, technology is fast changing, with consumer preferences becoming more demanding...", "In this regard, the BSP is committed to upgrade the country's retail payment system, promote electronic retail payments, and facilitate inter-operability for faster
