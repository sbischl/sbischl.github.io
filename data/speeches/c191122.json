mobility.", "Growth should be sustainable, inclusive and compatible with a necessary level of resilience.", "Here Central Bankers and Supervisors, in charge of financial stability, have a contribution to make.", "But what does that mean in the European context for the innovation and growth of our capital markets?", "My perspective on this rather complex issue is simple: we have to identify clearly the challenges raised by innovation and be ready to adapt our policy framework if we want that innovation goes with sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth of the European financial market.", "To

consumer protection issues raised by new technologies, anti-money laundering challenges posed by new usages, operational risks specific to third party providers and cloud outsourcing, including cyber-risks, competition impacts: the list of issues is quite long!", "I should also mention the systemic threats that large actors can represent if they use their huge consumer base and leverage on worldwide networks effects without sufficient regard for financial stability consequences.", "Facing these changes, Central Banks and Supervisors need to adopt the right mindset.", "In my view, they should not take the current regulatory framework for granted and operate under the assumption that this framework, which was mainly designed before the technological \u00ab disruptions \u00bb we see currently spreading through the financial system, does not need to evolve.", "On the contrary, to continue delivering well on their financial stability mandate, through their three classical roles, namely as catalyst, supervisor and service provider, they should aim first at promoting the necessary regulatory adjustments so that the ultimate goal of financial stability is well preserved.", "In other words, we should contribute to providing the market with a sound, adapted and updated regulatory framework, which is, in my opinion, needed to support innovation, and even to foster it.", "To

on-going work on by the ACPR Fintech team.", "When the ACPR published their report on AI artificial intelligence in 2018, we made it clear that the purpose was not to regulate ex ante, with a risk of hindering a promising technology.", "However, it seemed to us important to raise at an early stage the key issues of governance, ethics, auditability and explainability, in order to promote a sound

issues further, on a few significant AI use cases (AML-CT, internal models and consumer protection).", "Bilateral meetings were complemented by tests in real conditions, where ACPR experts and data

markets integration and development, through the provision of clearing and settlement services in central bank money for financial intermediaries.", "These services, namely T2 and T2S, have established themselves as the backbone of the financial market infrastructures for the euro.", "More recently, the Eurosystem has developed its Vision 2020 program comprising: TIPS, an instant payment solution, launched in November 2018 to settle instant the T2-T2S consolidation to optimize and enhance liquidity management and cash and securities services planned for 2021 ; last but not least, the

countries.", "Regarding the wholesale infrastructures, they still present various shortcomings, as market infrastructures are not interoperable around the world.", "The correspondent banking model is often considered as the only solution to transfer money across borders, but it is also costly, and lacks traceability and efficiency.", "The perimeter of the AML/CTF and KYC checks is in some cases

infrastructures, in particular when it comes to the Several initiatives or projects are in effect considered by the industry modalities of settlement.", "in the post-trade area, pointing to the role central banks could play in this regard, as they have done in the past.", "Therefore, the Eurosystem, as a major provider of critical wholesale clearing and settlement services in euro, should be open to experimenting these innovations in order to revisit and possibly improve the conditions under which we make available central bank money as a settlement asset.", "We, at the Banque de France, have started gaining exposure and experience with those innovations and in particular DLT.", "We were the first central bank to develop, regarding the specific use of SEPA creditor credentials, a decentralised register system based on a blockchain infrastructure, the \"MADRE\" register.", "Of course, this is only a first step, which does not exhaust an extremely vast and diversified field of experimentation.", "One possibility often mentioned would be for us to issue a central bank digital currency to support wholesale clearing and settlement services on a decentralised basis using DLT.", "We, at the Banque de France, are therefore quite open for experiments in that direction, together with the ECB and other central banks of the Eurosystem, in particular with regard to a wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency.", "Another operational contribution, which could be worth considering - and experimenting - by central banks, is related to one of the major failings of the current payment systems, which is cross-border retail payments.", "One solution to the weaknesses of private initiatives in the field of cross-border payments could be to interconnect these systems.", "It is technically and legally feasible for a given area, for example, in the euro zone.", "However, at the global scale, between systems of different areas, it is more complex, in particular when several currencies are involved.", "Central banks through their operational role could look for ways to contribute to the emergence of a solution to promote faster, more reliable and less costly payment solutions.", "To conclude, let me underline that technological innovations create opportunities and risks, and therefore challenges, not only for financial intermediares but also for public
