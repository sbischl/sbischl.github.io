public in the most efficient and convenient manner.", "We are also looking inward-to the human resource-the most important asset a central bank has.", "We are comprehensively examining our operational setup, what strategy will ensure the adequate inputs for carrying out the Bank's functions over time; and our communication with the public-whether, and how, to adjust how we explain ourselves to the

ideas, let's move for a moment to some current issues.", "As you know, last week the Monetary Committee decided to keep the interest rate unchanged, though it conveyed a different message than the one we conveyed in recent months.", "The message was changed because the data changed-in central banking jargon that is called data dependency.", "Within a relatively short period of time, we saw a decline in inflation, a change in the direction of monetary policy worldwide, a worsening of the risks to the global economy, and a relatively sharp appreciation of the shekel.", "We noted with satisfaction that the domestic economy is in a good situation-and indeed, when looking beyond the technical volatility, we see that the economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market remains tight, and it appears that to date the slowdown in the global economy is not trickling down to the Israeli economy, not even to exports, which continue to grow, particularly due to services exports.", "If the economy is in a good state, why did we note that if necessary we will take steps to make monetary policy more accommodative?", "First, because the trend of inflation changed.", "It is not clear to us at this point if it is noise in the data-loud noise, to be sure, but noise-or a fundamental decline in inflation.", "However, it is clear to us that we have to continue to strive and raise the inflation rate toward the midpoint of the target range.", "Second, the risks have intensified.", "Should the risks be realized, we will want to act in a timely manner, in order to prevent to the extent possible a slowdown in economic activity.", "We have a range of tools, and they are all on the table.", "There are the standard tools, and we are refreshing the toolbox regarding tools that have not been tried here, or have not been used for a very long time.", "And one more comment on monetary tools-in recent weeks the issue of the foreign exchange market has been in the headlines.", "Therefore, maybe this is the time to clarify-I did declare that in principle I would prefer that the exchange rate would be set by market equilibrium, and that was the also the Bank's approach before I took office.", "Practically, there is a window of exchange rates that we view as consistent with price stability and economic activity, when we take into account all the factors and variables in the economy.", "The window is dynamic, and depends on parameters that change all the time, which naturally should not be disclosed.", "From this perspective, the Bank of Israel policy on this issue could be called \"constructive ambiguity\", which is the appropriate policy for a small economy such as Israel; and therefore, if and when the Bank of Israel will assess that the exchange rate has materially deviated from the window that we defined, we may very well intervene in the market-and no one will receive a warning letter from us beforehand."], "classifications": ["none", "none",
