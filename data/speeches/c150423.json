domestic bond market.", "Mexico's currency market is the most liquid among those of all emerging economies.", "Mexico does not rely on capital flow management, especially in light of its negative experience with controls during the 1980s.", "Instead, in cases of extraordinary market volatility and particularly amid low liquidity, the country sometimes uses marginal rule-based FX intervention, mostly as a way to send a signal of confidence to market participants.", "This framework proved itself sufficiently solid during the recent global financial crisis.", "In particular, throughout 2008 and 2009, banks remained resilient to external shocks, maintaining strong balance sheets.", "This result reflects the crucial role of a sound macroeconomic framework, including a sustainable and

the way.", "The global search for yield in a context of lax monetary policies in advanced nations has led to substantial capital flows to emerging economies, including Mexico.", "In the near term, U.S. monetary normalization could be a precursor of a sudden stop or even a reversal of external funds, and induce a destabilizing drop in asset prices.", "In the face of this and other risks, the authorities must remain vigilant.", "Evaluation of macroprudential policies faces significant measurement challenges which make methodological progress necessary.", "Thus, any assessment should be taken with caution.", "Evidence on their effectiveness is still cursory, but much of it points towards the conclusion that macroprudential tools help make the system and institutions more resilient.", "However, their use is hardly a guarantee of precluding future financial crises.", "In designing macroprudential tools, rules are preferable to discretion, as they can be more easily formulated to generate the right incentives for making the financial system more stable.", "It is key to remain on the alert for possible unintended consequences in the form of distortions and inefficient resource allocation, and long-term risks of factors that may inhibit the development of the system.", "Until now, the prudential policies implemented in Mexico have worked well, but we need to continue
