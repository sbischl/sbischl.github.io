PRIVACY POLICY:

Dice Chart does not collect any user data.
Data which is required for the functioning of the app such as settings, player names and the state of the dice game are stored entirely on the user's device.
In fact, the app does not have the capability to access the internet since the required Android permissions for internet access are not set.
