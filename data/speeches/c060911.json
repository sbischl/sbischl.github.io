and develops realistic spending plans.", "Third, it advises the distressed people to gain access to the structured financial system, including banking.", "However, such counselling will be appropriate only if it addresses unique situations of households in different parts of India.", "Processes, costs and benefits It is technically possible for credit counselling to be ex ante or ex post.", "Ex ante counselling helps borrowers to decide upon the quantum of loans they can avail, based on their income profile and stream of cash flows.", "More importantly, ex ante counselling attempts to influence the stability of the borrowers' flow of income and expenses, thereby lowering the probability of default.", "Ex post counselling typically occurs after a crisis event, when the borrower has already missed one or several payments.", "The purpose of such counselling is to prevent default and foreclosure.", "It is, therefore, curative in nature.", "Credit counselling in practice generally tends to be ex post in nature.", "Such counselling involves oneon-one meetings, allowing the counsellor to observe the level of maintenance of the debt and other issues relevant to the stability of

inconvenience for the distressed families.", "Traditional banking technologies rely mainly on a set of pre-assigned standards to determine whether a potential borrower will be able to service a

towards mitigation of borrower risks is advocated.", "In the near-term, credit counselling can constitute an integral part of banks' loan application, which can facilitate better assessment of credit risk and repayment capacity.", "In the urban areas, where people are more technosavvy, such counselling can take place over the internet or the phone.", "In the rural areas, such interface could be made more personalised through direct face-to-face interaction with the affected clientele.", "Such preventative counselling would enable the borrower to determine the optimal level of sustainable debt and pre-empt deterioration of accounts at a future date.", "This is also likely to lower the incidence of customer complaints against banks.", "An important consequence of the counselling process may be that, as potential borrowers learn more about the way financial markets function, they may learn to behave more strategically and to prepay more often when interest rates are benign.", "If such behavior becomes prevalent, together with a positive effect of counselling on default, it may be an additional argument that counselling helps lowincome borrowers.", "It is necessary to recognise that there are several issues which require to be addressed in identifying possible approaches to initiate and popularise credit counselling for individual borrowers.", "Let me flag some of these issues for your consideration.", "First, how well can we combine credit counselling with some elements of financial literacy?", "Second, should credit counselling concentrate on ex ante or only on ex post elements or some combination of both?", "Third, should credit counselling agencies devise differential mechanisms to take into account different credit segments such as housing loans, consumer loans, farm loans as well as different categories of individual borrowers such as salaried, self-employed, seasonally employed etc?", "Is it better to have more general credit counsellors?", "Fourth, given the differential nature of cash flows and consumption patterns in rural and urban areas, is there a need for a segmented approach towards credit counselling?", "Fifth, should there be accreditation of credit counsellors?", "If so, who should do it - industry association or individual banks?", "Should counselling be a full-time or part-time work for the credit counsellors?", "Sixth, what should be the elements of confidentiality that are assured in this process to gain the confidence of distressed borrowers in need of counselling?", "Seventh, how do we select the credit counsellors, equip them to do the work and make them accountable?", "What type of training - both in terms of knowledge and attitude - could be imparted to make credit counsellors effective?", "Can the training colleges of banks be of help in this respect?", "Eighth, should there be a role for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and consumer organisations in order to expand the outreach of counselling practices?", "Finally, should the findings emanating from the discussion of credit counsellors constitute part of the agenda for the District-Level Bankers' Committees?", "I have only touched upon some of the issue germane to the initiation of the process at the present juncture.", "What is, however, important is to recognise that instead of a 'one-size-fits-all', banks should be free to experiment and evolve their own mechanisms and adopt approaches best suited to their business philosophy.", "Since financial counselling pertains primarily to individual borrowers at the local level, a decentralised approach could prove useful.", "Being a relatively new area whose potential is still to be proved, it is imperative to proceed in measured steps and reassess the situation based on the experience gained.", "In progressing towards this laudable objective, we, however, should not create another cadre of employees or potentially avoidable intermediaries between banks and their borrowers.", "We, in Reserve Bank are happy to note the initiative taken by Bank of India in starting credit counselling centres on a pilot basis.", "The involvement of trust 'Abhay' lends value and credibility to this pilot project.", "It is also noteworthy that one each in urban and rural areas is being initiated.", "We are looking forward to learn from the experience of this laudable initiative.", "I commend other banks to attempt some pilot projects, as considered appropriate by them, to explore the potential for beneficial use of credit counselling."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none",
