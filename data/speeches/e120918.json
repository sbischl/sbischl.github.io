20 September 2010, almost two years ago to the day.", "At that time the China UnionPay cards were accepted by a few merchants in the country.", "That official launch in 2010 enabled local merchants

BSP ATMs to accept China UnionPay credit and debit cards is a milestone achievement.", "This will now allow China UnionPay's 3.1 billion cardholders the ability to conduct financial transactions at any of BSP's 100 ATMs or 1,000 EFTPOS terminals when they are visiting Fiji.", "This milestone, with the added convenience of direct flights between Hong Kong and Fiji and the Visa on Arrival policy for Chinese visitors to Fiji, will add to the attractiveness of Fiji as a popular tourist destination for inbound Chinese travellers.", "China UnionPay, together with BSP, will be able to offer Chinese tourists, as well as UnionPay card cardholders from other countries, a better way to facilitate their financial transactions while they are in Fiji.", "We have noted a large increase in

any likely impact on our trading partners.", "Inflation in Fiji was 4.0 percent in July.", "This is lower than the inflation rates in the previous months.", "The decline is due to lower commodity

under $1.6 billion or adequate to cover 5 months of retained imports of goods and non factor services.", "We are currently reviewing economic data and the next official update on the economic
