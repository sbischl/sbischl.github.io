thus resulting in a sharp increase in the intermediation ratio, which is simply a ratio of bank loans to deposits.", "In essence, funds previously held in BoBCs have been diverted to loans by banks and more than doubled - growing by 104.3 percent, from P22.1 billion in December 2010 to P45.2 billion in January 2015.", "These funds have been effectively absorbed by the economy, to the benefit of businesses and households.", "Deposits increased at a slower pace of 31.7 percent from P40.4 billion to P53.2 billion in the same four-year period.", "The slower growth in deposits is possibly due to, among others, sluggish growth in incomes, inadequate financial inclusion, more streamlined procedures for government funding of parastatals and very low interest rates paid by banks on deposits.", "As funds available for lending become exhausted, it is inevitable that credit expansion would slow down.", "However, credit has continued to grow at a robust pace, as evidenced by the January 2015 annual growth rate of 13 percent, which is higher than nominal economic growth.", "In situations of tighter liquidity, banks tend to tighten lending criteria, while taking measures to boost deposits.", "Even then, current developments do not suggest that new lending will cease completely, as growth in deposits remains positive.", "It is indeed imperative that banks undertake measures to attract deposits, and focus on productive use of more limited funds available for lending.", "More emphasis on deposit mobilisation and improved financial inclusion would be steps in the right direction towards a more mature banking sector.", "There are also complementary measures that the Bank of Botswana stands ready to undertake in support of banks as they review their operations in an environment of reduced liquidity.", "These include a reduction of the Primary Reserve Requirement and enhanced access to Bank of Botswana lending facilities.", "It is with this in mind that I wish to take this opportunity to inform you and, through you, all stakeholders that the Bank of Botswana has decided to reduce the Primary Reserve Requirement for banks from the current 10 percent to 5 percent, with effect from April 1, 2015.", "This will release a total of P2.3 billion to augment the banks' loanable funds.", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Bank liquidity", "Credit growth", "Deposits", "Banking sector", "Capital adequacy", "Financial inclusion", "BoBCs", "Primary Reserve Requirement", "Lending criteria", "Bank lending"]}
