short-term gains will not achieve long-term sustainability.", "The traditional view that the sole purpose of business is to make money the more the better is no longer a tenable view today.", "Institutional logic now dictates that companies are more than instruments for generating money; the value that a company creates should be measured not just in terms of short-term profits but also in terms of how it sustains the conditions that allow it to flourish over time.", "What this means is that industry players today should not be fixated solely on generating profits but rather investing in relationships with their customers.", "If the industry can meet the needs of its customers, then that relationship will sustain the insurance company or takaful operator even during distressing periods.", "Regularly benchmark against the best to measure your performance Benchmarking exercises have proven to drive performance improvement by facilitating comparison and performance measurement

benchmarking exercise since 2001, in line with recommendations of the Financial Sector Master Plan to drive performance improvement.", "I believe the industry has benefitted from this initiative to improve the standard of services provided to its customers.", "Going forward however, it is timely and economically sensible for the industry to collaborate and assume this role to develop its own range of indicators.", "If we were to strive for quality, the benchmarking should be against the world's best, and not confined to our domestic market alone.", "The benchmarking could cover a wider range of indicators including financial and operating statistics, distribution channels as well as customer service indices that will benefit every member company.", "In many countries, it is the industry associations that undertake this role.", "In this regard, I call upon the associations present here tonight to give this matter a serious thought.", "Collaborate and cooperate with others as

effort to develop the Fraud Intelligence System is a very good step.", "I envisage seeing more collaborative digital propositions from the industry in the near future.", "The industry must be committed to the expectation set by the Government for the nation to achieve a penetration rate of 75% by 2020.", "The current penetration rate of 56% indicates concerted and urgent actions are
