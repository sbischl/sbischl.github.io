three of which are particularly worthy of note.", "First, the traditional model of commercial banking involves establishing long term relationships with customers and supplying a range of financial services to their customers.", "This enables banks to mobilise deposits more cheaply and to reduce the costs of transactions, thus making lending more commercially viable.", "The traditional model of commercial banking also provides synergies between different types of financial services - payments, deposits, and loans - which allow banks to realise economies of scope.", "Digitalization threatens to disrupt the traditional model of commercial banking.", "In particular, digitalization may enable non-bank service providers to encroach into the market for some of the key services offered by banks.", "For example, telecom companies can offer payment services through mobile money.", "This will diminish the incentives for the public to hold demand deposits in banks, which in turn threatens to erode the banks' primary source of low cost funds.", "Secondly, the adoption of digital technologies will transform the spectrum of risks which banks face.", "In traditional banking business models, operational risks are relatively minor compared with credit risk or market risk, but this will not be the case for banking services which are dependent on digital platforms for their delivery.", "Banks will be exposed to the risk that their digital platforms will suffer breakdowns, which will disrupt the provision of services to their customers.", "They will also face risks of cyber fraud perpetrated on their customers' accounts.", "Ensuring that their IT systems are resilient and that their customers' accounts can be protected from cyber fraud should be a priority for commercial banks.", "Banks cannot afford to lose the trust of their customers with respect to the safety of their accounts.", "Digitalization will thus add a new layer of complexity to the risk management of banks.", "Thirdly, digitalization will have major implications for the skill requirements of bank staff.", "Banks will need to employ staff with highly specialized IT expertise who can maintain their IT systems and rectify faults in these systems very quickly, to avoid disruption of services to their customers.", "Clearly people with these types of skills are in scarce supply on the labour market in East Africa.", "The demands on managerial staff will also evolve.", "Bank managers will need to develop a good understanding of how their IT systems work and how they link into the overall operations of banks, so that they can identify where operational risks are likely to arise from and make strategic decisions about the use of IT systems.", "Over the course of the next five days, you will hear a variety of presentations from experts in the field on topics related to the digitalization of banking services, including presentations on how banks can strategically position themselves in rapidly changing financial markets, new paradigms for financial inclusion, risk based oversight and regulatory compliance and career development.", "You will have the benefit of an excellent team of resource persons, most of who are senior officials in the financial services industry in East Africa, and who have come here to share their expertise with you.", "I am confident that the presentations and discussions in this Banking School will offer you valuable insights and contribute to the development of your careers."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Digitalization", "Banking", "Financial Inclusion", "Commercial Banking", "Digital Technologies", "Risks", "IT Systems", "Cyber Fraud", "Skill Requirements", "Financial Services"]}
