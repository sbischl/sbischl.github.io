the conduct of business part and has left prudential focus to entity regulation.", "More importantly, there was no explicit policy framework for markets from a stability perspective.", "Mr. Howard Davies, the previous chairman of the FSA recently admitted that \"The political mood, and certainly the mood in the markets, was that regulators should observe how markets evolved and try to craft their regulatory environment to cope with the risks that emerged.", "We have now seen that an approach of that sort can step too far back... We now can see that if you step too far back, trends can develop in a way which creates trouble, and that there needs to be, I think, more self-confidence in the regulatory world to be prepared to step in at an earlier stage and to challenge the judgments of the markets.", "It is surprising that this paradoxical approach Mr. Howard Davies talks about is not being altered even now though there is recognition of the need to monitor systemic interconnectedness.", "The macro-prudential approach to regulation, now being considered imperative for financial entities, is still some way from being applied to financial markets.", "Just to illustrate, one of the arguments against the way financial products have evolved relates to the problem of information asymmetries: the gulf between the market makers and market takers.", "Large financial firms run huge positions across multiple assets and have the ability as well as incentive to move markets in a way advantageous for them.", "This is not merely an exaggerated concern: there are increasing number of articles trying to interpret the link between the creation and selling of CDOs by large investment firms on underlying securities of doubtful nature prior to the crisis and simultaneously going short.", "In plain words, on the one hand you sell the derivatives to less informed investors betting on the upside, while at the same time place huge bets to gain yourself from the downside.", "Here comes the systemic perspective in regulation: what may be good for a particular entity may be sowing seeds of instability for the system.",

extremes and warners and skeptics somewhere in the middle.", "Through the crisis, there have been similar voices in the context of the role of markets.", "On one end of the spectrum are the denialist notions that there is inherently nothing wrong with the markets and the primary drivers for the crisis lay in the macro-economic realm.", "At the other end, there are the calamitists arguing for a radical shift in the way markets are regulated since they have failed spectacularly.", "The truth, as usual may lie somewhere in the middle.", "Some key issues have indeed been acknowledged and are being addressed.", "There have been broad agreements on the principles, the problem is that these are the common minimum principles and the implementation is being driven by contextual issues in each country.", "Interconnectedness 14.", "The crisis has highlighted the importance of improving our understanding of interconnectedness in the financial system through direct links between financial institutions and the indirect links created through financial markets.", "The key channels of propagation of risks are maturity mismatches and leverage.", "In regard to direct links, there is need for bringing all inter-bank/intra-financial system exposures both on and off-balance sheet within the macro prudential framework.", "While there are prudential requirements for individual bank's exposures to other banks, there is appreciation of the need to prescribe safeguards on the liabilities side of the balance sheet too and to ensure availability of adequate good quality liquid assets.", "The growth in financial sector over the past few years has been exponential.", "While many have argued that this has also contributed to real economy growth, behind the numbers lays the critical role of leverage and off-balance sheet financing.", "As mentioned in the Turner Review, from about 2003 onwards there were significant increases in the measured on-balance sheet leverage of many commercial and investment banks, driven in some cases by dramatic increases in gross assets and derivative positions.", "This coupled with the growth of \"shadow banking\" meant that the so-called benefits from financial sector growth have been mostly illusory.", "Firms whose business models were based on high leverage and excessive dependence on uninterrupted access to secured funding markets were highly vulnerable in the crisis.", "Many firms relied on excessive short-term wholesale financing of long term illiquid assets including on cross border basis.", "During the crisis they were faced with lenders demanding substantial cushions or haircuts on the assets they were willing to finance.", "Moreover, these assets taken as collateral were illiquid and lenders failed to factor in this risk.", "This combined with excessive leverage accentuated the vulnerability.", "The excessive dependence of entities on wholesale funding markets such as repo or other collateralised markets is an issue of systemic concern since one, it accentuates systemic procyclicality through haircuts/margins and two, the leverage loop that builds through these markets in high liquidity periods induces rigidity and gets entrenched into funding models of entities.", "It is therefore imperative to bring the secured funding markets such as repo markets within the regulatory perimeter/macro prudential framework, particularly since many entities participating in these markets are unregulated/lightly regulated.", "There is need for a cautious approach when the securities that are repo'ed/collateralised carry credit risk and are illiquid.", "This also raises the issue of interconnectedness of banks to private pools of capital that are largely unregulated.", "While the reform of the financial system does cover regulation of hedge funds, the general issue of banks exposures to these funds directly as well as through markets needs greater attention.", "The same applies to private equity which are unregulated entities.", "These entities rely on funding markets for leverage.", "From a macro prudential perspective it is not just necessary to regulate banks exposures to these entities but also to limit the overall leverage of these entities if they are permitted to access funds directly from banks and other financial intermediaries and indirectly via funding markets.", "OTC market infrastructure 20.", "A large number of initiatives are underway at the international level to strengthen the infrastructure for OTC derivatives, a clear amplifier of stress particularly in credit derivatives market in the crisis as evidenced by AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman episodes.", "The deficiencies within the OTC derivatives market viz.", "the management of counterparty credit risk and the absence of sufficient transparency have pushed the policy preference to exchange traded/centrally cleared models.", "However the specific proposals being discussed in various countries do envisage continuance of non-standardised OTC contracts albeit with a stricter bilateral collateralization requirement and higher capital charge.", "Increasingly more nuanced perspectives on this issue are being articulated, the most recent one being the discussion paper of December 2009 from the HMT and the FSA in UK which argues against the need for mandating the trading of standardized derivatives on organized trading platforms provided steps are taken to improve transparency and mitigate the risks of OTC derivatives.", "According to this paper regulatory objectives of reducing counterparty risk and improving transparency can be achieved by other means and they would review progress of initiatives in this area.", "Moreover, mandating the use of organised platforms would imply a regulatory imposition of trading structure, which they do not believe is necessary.", "The paper argues that mere standardisability cannot be a sufficient condition for central clearing and other factors such as availability of prices, depth of market liquidity and whether the product contains inherent risk attributes that cannot be mitigated by the CCP need to be considered by regulators.", "The essence of a CCP arrangement is netting and margining, which are contingent on homogeneity of the underlying asset, availability of reliable prices and sound risk models to capture future potential exposures.", "The ability of models to capture tail risks has been comprehensively put to question post crisis.", "How would the exchanges be better able to measure and manage risk where some of the biggest financial firms with the soundest risk management systems failed?", "This would be particularly true of credit products such as CDS.", "In this context, the nature of collateral regime becomes extremely important.", "Any instrument with a credit risk element would inherently not be suitable for a collateral.", "If these aspects are not addressed by the regulators, mandatory clearing would only result in a potentially riskier system.", "end users are opposing mandatory move to exchanges and clearing platforms on the ground that the crisis was inherently due to complex transactions between financial intermediaries and there should be no increase in cost to the real sector, i.e.", "genuine end-users, for undertaking derivative trades.", "Currently, a CPSS-IOSCO Committee is looking into the existing standards for the systemic entities like the CCP.", "Given the nature of their functions which require incentives for strong risk management and building adequate financial resources in the form of settlement guarantee funds and their systemic importance, it is worthwhile to consider central counterparties as \"public utility\" and not-for profit entities to reduce moral hazard.", "A key criticism of the proposed reforms has been that it doesn't address the fundamental issue of speculative use of derivatives and excessive financialisation of all products.", "In fact, by transferring most of OTC market onto exchanges, it might be further accentuating it.", "It is not surprising to hear major global exchanges as well as brokers betting on a manifold increase in the CDS market as a result of electronic trading and central clearing.", "A recent study7 has found that of the gross CDS position of 23 large US Banks only around 2 per cent was for hedging the rest was for their dealer activities.", "Though the figures pertain to 2005, they give a fair idea of really how much of the CDS market was actually for pure speculation.", "Speculation does play an economic role in increasing market liquidity and price discovery but beyond a point, trading without an underlying interest could only increase systemic risk particularly when the same market prices and volatilities get entrenched into the balance sheets of the real sector.", "Another area where progress has been slow relates to the rating agencies.", "There have been some proposals to mitigate conflicts between raters and issuers who pay them but these have largely been in the nature of more disclosures by rating agencies and separation of the consultancy/advisory roles.", "Some of the fundamental issues have been left unaddressed, particularly the methodological issues, accountability arrangements and overstretching of rating agencies.", "A key issue that has not been addressed is the ratings given by rating agencies based on implicit support without the need to disclose the rating status without such implicit support.", "From the point of view of transparency to investors and accountability there is need for further disclosures in this regard.", "Capital account management 27.", "For emerging countries the macro prudential framework has also to deal with vulnerability arising from cross-border capital flows, currency mismatches and foreign currency liquidity in the financial system.", "Rapid and volatile capital inflows or outflows can present significant policy challenges - potentially leading to exchange rate overshooting, asset price volatility and financial instability.", "In this context, appropriate and pragmatic use of capital account regulations may have to be considered by emerging markets in order to maintain financial stability if considered necessary.", "In the past, it has been argued that market discipline can play a key role in incentivising market participants to limit their excessive risk taking activities.", "However, the events of the last few years have proved the inadequacy of market discipline and bankers have been engaged in risk-taking activities disguised as value-creation.", "Time and again market participants have engaged in herd behaviour and put the financial system at risk.", "It is poignant to note how relevant Charles Mackay's observation in his popular book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Madness of Crowds, written in 1841, even today.", "Mackay wrote, ''Men, it has been well said think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one\".", "The events of the past few years tell us that market discipline expressed via market prices cannot be expected to play a major role in constraining risk taking, and that the primary constraint needs to come from regulation and supervision.", "So how do we manage the trade-off between financial stability, effective regulations on the one hand and free markets on the other?", "One, the responsibility for financial stability cannot be fragmented across several regulators; it has to rest unambiguously with a single entity, and that single entity optimally is the central bank.", "And second, that there is need for coordination across regulators on a regular basis and for developing a protocol for responding to a crisis situation.", "In my opinion, any regulation that is envisaged should be based on the touchstone of the following: Regulations that does not lead to

despite the daily overnight rates remaining around the interest rate corridor, the daily absolute change in the weighted average rates have not been smooth.", "While we are all aware of the skewed distribution of liquidity in the banking system due to different balance sheet sizes of the banks, the rapid roll-out of RTGS system and the core banking solutions perhaps offers us an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and optimize the day to day liquidity management to reduce the opportunity costs and more importantly improve the ability to lend on term basis.", "The term money market

AD category I banks have to ensure that the customers have sound risk management system, the corporates should have adopted AS 30 and AS 32, the corporates can not combine these options with any other derivative products and moreover, the pricing of the premium has to be done in a transparent manner.", "We have also received feedback to continue the facility of zero cost structures since some of the companies find the instrument useful in managing currency risks.", "However, the bundling of asymmetric risks makes it complex in pricing as well as in valuation and can be opaque to the risk managers and top management.", "It is also proposed to continue to allow persons resident in India, other than banks and financial institutions to use FCY-INR swaps to transform long-term INR borrowing into foreign exchange liability.", "There have been concerns that the use of FCY-INR swap to convert long term Rupee borrowing into foreign exchange liability may lead to speculative trades in the absence of underlying risk exposures.", "However, this facility has been in existence for a decade and has supported distribution of foreign currency risks within the Indian market without increasing the overall external debt.", "Such a facility may come handy for a corporate, especially the exporters, having future foreign exchange receivables.", "The foreign exchange liability position assumed through FX swap may match with the foreign exchange receivables and provide the benefit of hedging.", "The issue is should such swaps be limited to only companies which have potential forex exposures.", "On the anvil is the introduction of credit default swaps.", "We are at an advanced stage of introducing other currency pairs for currency futures and are examining the issue of allowing plain vanilla currency options in consultation with SEBI.", "Broadly speaking, the mandate for financial sector development should ideally derive from the regulatory assessments for each market.", "It has been clearly evidenced during the crisis that financial sector development per se cannot be an objective in itself.", "It needs to be pursued in the broader context of financial stability and has to necessarily correspond to the level of maturity of the financial system and the needs of the real economy.", "Reforming financial markets involves improving access to simple, transparent, and easy-to-understand products.", "Increasing complexity does not facilitate the market mechanism.", "The purpose of financial instruments is to transfer risk to those that understand these risks, not to hide or camouflage them.", "Regulatory comfort and assessment should therefore be a critical determinant in pursuing financial reforms.", "In regard to derivatives, we have both OTC and exchange traded instruments for currency and interest rates.", "OTC markets in India are well regulated, unlike many other jurisdictions, to address issues of leverage and customer appropriateness and suitability.", "Only OTC contracts where one party to the transaction is a RBI regulated entity is considered legally valid.", "Suitable reporting and post trade clearing and settlement mechanisms are being further strengthened.", "Given the incentive structures of these market, convergence of regulatory frameworks for OTC and exchange traded markets cannot be an end in itself under present circumstances, though it is a long term goal.", "The development of markets is also influenced by tax policies.", "Debt instruments for instance do not enjoy tax exemptions of the nature enjoyed by equity instruments whether on income or capital gains.", "Mutual funds fixed income products enjoy certain tax examptions not available to banks.", "But this is outside the regulatory purview.", "However, if these policies introduce any vulnerability in the financial system there is need to address this through appropriate macroprudential and microprudential regulations.", "Based on the assessment and experience, further liberalization measures for expanding the product menu could be undertaken.", "However, participation of foreigners in new products and the financial markets in general would continue to be dictated by the capital account management and financial stability imperatives.", "I wish the conference all success."], "classifications":
