productivity.", "The government can also promote public awareness on productivity, setting up national awards and recognition programmes and building up the needed institutional infrastructure.", "The adoption of a Service Excellence Framework by the government to address productivity and customer quality problems in its ministries and departments is a very positive development.", "Finally on the

partnership between government, employers and workers is strengthened further in Fiji bearing in mind that at the end of the day our goals are mutual.", "What if we do not raise productivity?", "On a macro level, we will fail to realize our GDP growth potential let alone reach our growth target.", "This means there will be fewer jobs available for many of our children and grandchildren.", "This means more unemployment, and less income.", "Poverty will rise leading to social problems.", "Eventually, everyone pays for the low productivity as we are already doing.", "But unfortunately, the burden of that cost will be borne more by low-income earners and the poor in our communities.", "They are the most vulnerable.", "They are the first to go in a job redundancy situation and the little asset they have are not usually protected from inflation.", "In addition, as consumers they will again face higher prices.", "Concluding comments Is higher productivity going to solve all our problems?", "But it will go a long way in removing efficiencies in all levels of the economy.", "This efficiency will have significant favourable ramifications throughout the economy.", "And in Fijis case of low long-term growth potential, higher productivity will launch us to a high growth orbit.", "My guess is that if we raise productivity growth by one percent, our growth potential will rise by two percent.", "That will make a lot of difference to everyone.", "Raising productivity is not the responsibility of TPAF or government only.", "It is the responsibility of everyone.", "If we are to improve our quality of life, then each one of us, every worker, business, industry, and government must be committed to the same common goal."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none",
