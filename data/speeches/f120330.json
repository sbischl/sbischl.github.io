Banking complemented by core banking solutions implemented by banks, mobile banking, card based electronic transactions at any bank ATM and merchants locations (both physical and through e-commerce

a mobile device the most appropriate delivery channel of financial services?", "Besides the technology capability to transmit financial information in an efficient, secure and cost-effective manner enabled by development of mobile based applications for banking, the most significant fact about this idea is the ubiquity of the mobile phones.", "The number of mobile phones in the country are said to be nearing a billion phones.", "Hence, banking and financial services, which have already come a long way from the branch level services to the customer's home desktop and laptop, can now be

have a great potential if the security and cost aspects are addressed for it has to serve a large number of transactions that are small in size.", "It has to be remembered that use of mobile for banking in financial inclusion cannot become a viable proposition on a standalone basis if the purpose is to achieve meaningful financial inclusion.", "To make it viable and attract volumes, it has to be provided as a package along with other products and services.", "This can be achieved only by entities that can provide add-on services like emergency and entrepreneurial credit, saving facilities, other products and services such as insurance, besides remittances.", "This is where a mainstream regulated entity like a bank fits in.", "True, some of these alternatives are being provided by a few NBFCs but their scale and reach are not comparable with banks.", "They can serve niche markets but are not viable in the long run.", "But, they indeed will facilitate financial inclusion.", "So, the

basic banking services.", "Banks have not really made a significant penetration even among their existing customers to extend mobile banking services.", "However, for me, the most important concern is that there is a significant percentage of financially excluded population and the potential of the mobile phone to extend them financial services is still to be tapped.", "Reserve Bank has always been conscious of the need to bring every citizen of the country within the ambit of the banking system.", "Appreciating the difficulties of banks to viably operate bank branches in every village, we had permitted them to appoint Business Correspondents (BCs) to address this.", "On demand from the industry, we have also permitted \"for profit\" companies to be appointed as Business Correspondents,

the pace is far too slow and the process needs to be expedited.", "Some generic issues 10.", "While on the subject, let me discuss some generic issues relating to e-money on which we are often quizzed.", "Is e-money in India overregulated when elsewhere there is higher level of tolerance towards anonymity of e-money transactions?", "Non-banks in India can issue only semi-closed prepaid instruments, which do not provide for cash withdrawals.", "Is KYC requirement justified in such cases, when any usage of the card will only result in credits to the bank accounts of the merchants?",

information about the source of the funds?", "In the light of such threat, is the RBI and the Government too obsessed with KYC and AML issues?", "As you know, e-money or the prepaid payment instruments, whether in the e-wallets, m-wallets, prepaid cards or paper coupons, have been brought under regulation for the first time with the enactment of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act,

significant way.", "We have allowed issue of prepaid instruments up to Rs.,000 for exclusive use for purchase of travel tickets without the need for KYC.", "It must, however, be remembered that there are certain statutory requirements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act which need to be met.", "However, within the existing statute, the Bank is constantly reviewing the position to identify the areas which impair the growth of e-money to initiate remedial measures.", "We have been on record that e-money is a more secure way of payments and needs to be promoted to ensure that our objectives of moving towards a less cash society.", "Should MSPs be allowed on a standalone basis?", "On the question of MSPs being allowed to do money transfer service on a standalone basis, perhaps such a measure would help in providing an alternative mode to the existing Money Order / Instant Money Order being offered by the services, though it would be difficult for me to say which one would be a cheaper option.", "The Department of Posts also has over 1.5 lakh post offices for delivery of services, though the IMO is extended to just a little over 3000 post offices.", "The MSPs have the technology and an impressive agent network to deliver the service with efficiency.", "It was against this backdrop, that the non-bank entities have been permitted to enable prepaid card to card transfers.", "The model would, therefore, benefit the financially excluded population both in urban and rural areas to send or receive money in a convenient way.", "It is still not clear to me as to why the demand for standalone MSP model is persisting when we have allowed a far superior model where collaboration rather than competition is expected to result in a win win situation for all?", "Why should the stake holders insist on an inferior alternative?", "Are there any insurmountable problems in the collaborative model?", "If yes, what are they?", "I am aware that some of the issues that come up in this regard relate to (i) who owns the customer?", "(ii) who controls the transactions?", "Has there been any worthwhile attempt to resolve them in a mature way?", "I would urge upon the

was careful about the quality of inflows.", "Secondly, we have had rules that required all forex flows to be routed only through banking institutions or others specifically authorized to undertake forex transactions.", "Given this background, even if we had to agree mobile phones can only be used to trigger the transfer of funds from overseas by a non-resident to the beneficiary's bank account in India.", "The banks will have to be responsible for ensuring quality of funds, KYC, etc.", "We have in fact permitted banks to enable cross border bank account to bank account remittance through the medium of mobile subject to clearance from the local regulator.", "At the beneficiary end, we have enabled loading of funds received from overseas under the Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS) scheme on to a prepaid payment instrument issued by a bank, which could include a mobile wallet, to the recipient of the funds.", "Before I conclude, let me reiterate that the mobile phone is a potent tool to facilitate financial services and thus financial inclusion.", "It has the potential but the security and cost aspects have to be addressed.", "The medium of mobile has to sub-serve smaller transactions and must become cheaper.", "The Reserve Bank has for well considered reasons opted for a bank-led model as it is a complete model for delivery of a wide range of services.", "Just as you cannot have tele-medicine without a doctor, you cannot have mobile banking without a bank!", "The BC model would help to complement mobile banking, as customers need to approach BCs/ATMs only for hard currency requirements and conduct other banking transactions from anywhere from their mobile phones, provided of course, there are no tele-connectivity issues!", "As mentioned earlier, it is the social responsibility of everyone, who has the resources and the power, to contribute to the success of financial inclusion.", "While we have the guidelines to M-power financial services, it is necessary for us, the RBI, banks and the MSPs in particular, to take this forward in the 4th gear by convincing the common man not only on the power of the mobile phone for doing financial transactions but also the safety and security aspects of mobile banking, to provide a level of comfort.", "I believe there are success stories of mobile banking in states like Bihar, thanks to the initiatives of the certain NGOs and banks, which has enabled not only financial inclusion but made less literate people mobile banking-savvy.", "This needs to be emulated through adequate publicity and education to achieve M-powerment in a significant way.", "I thank you all for giving me this opportunity to address this august gathering.", "I hope some of the issues that I have raised will be discussed in this Summit and some solutions found.", "I wish you all the best."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
