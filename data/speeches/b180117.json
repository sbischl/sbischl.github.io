and in absolute terms, NPLs fell by 32 percent.", "Over the same period, the total capital adequacy ratio of the banking system increased from 19.8 percent to 23.8 percent of its risk weighted assets.", "Strong capital buffers are of particular importance in bolstering the resilience of banks to adverse shocks.", "As I noted earlier, 2017 has been a year of consolidation, especially in regard to bank lending, with gross loans and advances increasing by a mere 1.8 percent in the year to September 2017.", "I hope that the downward trend in NPLs and the reduction in the policy interest rate will encourage banks to ease their lending policies and thereby enable an acceleration of credit growth in 2018.", "A crucial problem which needs to be addressed if banks are to strengthen loan quality is that of the valuation of property.", "In a recent survey on real estate lending by BoU, the majority of commercial banks reported concerns about valuation standards and some indicated that they have faced challenges realizing the value for collateral because of inflated valuation reports.", "A key gap appears to be the lack of a uniform industry standard.", "I think that it would be useful for the UBA to work with stakeholders to develop common guidelines and standards in this area.", "Looking ahead; I am confident that the banking industry in Uganda can innovate to reduce the cost of financial services, broaden the range of services available to customers and widen access to financial services, in particular through the adoption of digital financial services.", "Since 2009 we have witnessed the exponential growth of mobile money transactions, which is radically transforming the way in which payments and money transfers are made in Uganda.", "For instance, in the year to June 2017; there were over one billion transactions worth over Shs.", "52 trillion (about half of Uganda's nominal GDP) on the mobile money platforms.", "The challenge now is to bring about a similar transformation in the way in which other types of financial services, such as savings and credit products, can be delivered to customers and at lower costs.", "Finally, the advent of digital financial platforms such as mobile money was seen by some commentators as competition to the formal financial services sector.", "To the contrary, these digital platforms have crowded in more users into the formal financial system, with the number of accounts in commercial banks increasing from 4.5 million as at June 2015 to 7.4 million as at June 2017; while number of accounts in financial institutions licensed by the BoU (Commercial banks, Credit Institutions and MDIs) rose by 3.3 million over a two year period to 9.3 million accounts as at June 2017.", "Thank you for listening and I wish you a joyous festive season."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Banking industry", "Financial services", "Bank of Uganda", "Inflation", "Economic growth", "Non-performing loans", "Uganda Bankers' Association", "Digital financial services", "Financial consolidation", "Property valuation"]}
