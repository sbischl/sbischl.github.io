long-term growth is to keep inflation low and stable.", "Price stability reduces uncertainty and generates an environment that promotes investment, productivity growth, and financial development.", "Likewise, these factors stimulate growth and favor risk diversification.", "Moreover, price stability prevents the arbitrary and often regressive redistribution of resources between debtors and creditors, and between the owners of labor and capital.", "It also limits the Central Bank's collection of a disruptive and regressive tax: inflation.", "In short, low and stable inflation improves

"Expectations play a crucial role.", "If agents expect inflation to go down towards a target, they will price their goods accordingly and inflation persistence will be lower.", "If, in contrast, agents expect inflation to persist in high levels, they will price goods higher, making inflation more persistent and more difficult for the central bank to bring it down.", "As stated in Bernanke

well anchored, a one-time increase in energy prices should not lead to a permanent increase in inflation, but only to a change in relative prices.\"", "Credibility of the target in an inflation-targeting regime is therefore a key asset.", "If we were to give up on the inflation commitment, the future adjustment of interest rates to rein in inflation would have to be much larger, with adverse consequences on economic activity and relative prices, in particular the exchange rate.", "Indeed, we have witnessed many experiences where a persistent rise in inflation has required strong monetary policy actions, the most notable case being the great inflation of the USA in the 1970s and early 80s.", "The control of inflation in Chile has also come with a decline in inflationary persistence.", "Therefore, a credible commitment to price stability brings along output stability.", "Output stability, in turn, is an important factor to foster economic growth and the consequent social progress that comes with it (Ramey and Ramey, 1995, and Fatas, 2002).", "This is also what has happened with the well known Great Moderation experienced in industrialized countries, where a credible monetary policy framework committed to stabilize inflation is one of the explanatory factors (Gali\u0301 and Gambetti, 2007).", "As a consequence of the above, a central issue for inflation targeters is finding reliable measures of inflation expectations.", "The most common practice is to rely on surveys to specialists and on financial prices.", "Surveys not always are good measure of market expectations, especially for longer terms which are those that most interest central banks.", "For example, in the case of Chile, the expected inflation 24 months ahead reported by market analysts in the monthly survey conducted by the Central Bank has very little variation, which is hard to believe given the magnitude of shocks.", "On the other hand, inflation compensations derived from financial market prices have premiums that are hard to measure and most likely time varying.", "In fact, inflation compensation measures have recently shown increases.", "This has been observed also in several other countries.", "We believe this to be driven, to a large extent, by changes in different risk premiums in the context of high uncertainty, liquidity problems and portfolio adjustments.", "Indeed, the inflationary compensation from year 5 to year 10 has increased together with the forecast error of inflation.", "In light of the flaws presented by the indicators, the best
