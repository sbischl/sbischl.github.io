and economic stability constitutes the prerequisite to ensure steady progress of economic reform and development.", "Since reform will more or less affect the interests of almost all the parties in the society, it is important to make the reform endurable to the individuals, enterprises and all other social sectors.", "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and taking into consideration of the Chinese situation, we have embarked on a path of reform gradualism to build a socialist market economic system with Chinese characteristics.", "That is to say, we will on the one hand stick to the mandate of socialist market economic reform, while on the other hand give full consideration to the endurance of all walks of life, and strive to make the reform benefit most of the people in the society.", "In practice, sweeping reforms are usually introduced when favorable conditions arise, and the pace of reform will be slowed down if conflicts intensify.", "All in all, in the

Preventing excessive growth of money and credit through raising the requirement reserve ratio further by 0.5 percentage points from 7 percent to 7.5 percent based on the 1 percentage point hike in 2003; this action froze usable fund of the financial institutions totaling RMB110 billion yuan; Establishing positive incentives to introduce differentiated required reserve ratios for different financial institutions.", "The required reserve ratio applied to a financial institution will be linked to its performance indicators such like capital adequacy ratio and asset quality.", "The lower

"Sequenced gradual reform of the RMB exchange rate regime Like the overall economic reform, China's foreign exchange rate system reform is also a gradual and sequenced process.", "Before economic opening up, management of foreign exchange earnings and expenses was centralized and RMB exchange rate was decided and adjusted solely by the government.", "After 1979, enterprises were allowed to retain foreign exchange earnings and a foreign exchange swap market was established to form dual exchange rates in China, namely the official exchange rate and the swap market exchange rate.", "With foreign exchange system reform introduced in 1994, foreign exchange purchase and sale was required to be effected through the banking system and a nation-wide inter-bank foreign exchange market was thus put into place, leading to the formation of the so-called managed floating foreign exchange rate system based on market supply and demand of foreign exchange.", "Such a system has since remained unchanged.", "The RMB exchange rate has been allowed to fluctuate since 1994.", "After the breakout of the Asian financial crisis, responding to the appeal of the neighboring countries and

world economy, China has provided more and more low-cost and high-quality products to the international markets.", "This has not been achieved by the adjustment of RMB exchange rate.", "Instead, it has been benefited from China's huge labor force with low cost and improving skills.", "Also, the problems of trade deficit and unemployment in some countries cannot be resolved by the revaluation of RMB.", "Chinese government does not seek to maintain trade surplus, but hopes to keep a balanced current account.", "Export expansion will inevitably result in the increase of import, thus creating opportunities for other countries to increase their export.", "Trade partners should not blame each other for the adverse impact of others' products on their domestic industries.", "Instead, they should actively participate in the international division of labor and fully exploit their comparative advantages.", "Second, a stable and growing Chinese economy will benefit the stability and development of the world economy.", "Last year, with rapid growth of export, China's import also expanded rapidly.", "Import growth was 39.9 percent for the whole year.", "In particular, import from EU, United States and Canada grew by 37.7 percent, 24.3 percent and 20.6 percent respectively.", "Import growth accelerated to 42.4 percent in the first four months of this year, 10.5 percentage points higher than the growth of export, resulting in a trade deficit of over USD10 billion.", "Import from EU, United States and Canada in the first four months grew by 33.7 percent, 41.5 percent and 60.1 percent respectively.", "The growth of the Chinese economy has contributed importantly to the recent world economic recovery.", "Any improper change in the RMB exchange rate policy may create new uncertainties to the world economic development.", "Therefore, we should be extremely cautious.", "Recently, some foreign friends have showed their concerns about the potential overheating of the Chinese economy due to the expansion of money supply as a result of the rapid increase of foreign exchange.", "I would like to reassure these friends by recalling our experience during the Asian financial crisis.", "At that time, China successfully maintained steady economic growth while keeping the RMB exchange rate basically stable.", "Today, we are confident that we will be able to prevent great ups and downs in the national economy while keeping the external value of our currency basically stable.", "China's exchange rate reform is still underway.", "In light of the China's current stage of economic development, performance of the economy and developments in international payments, we will further examine and improve the mechanism for determining the RMB exchange rate and keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level.", "In pursuing the exchange rate reform, due consideration will be given to China's current economic and social development, the government's macroeconomic management capability and the progress achieved in various economic reforms and financial reforms including the improvement of financial supervision capacity.", "The reform of the RMB exchange rate cannot be carried out in isolation.", "Instead, it should be pursued in tandem with other reforms.", "Several preconditions need to be met before the RMB exchange rate can be freely floated.", "First, trade, particularly service trade, has been substantially liberalized.", "Second, progress has been achieved in the liberalization of capital account to adapt to a more flexible exchange rate system.", "Third, major breakthroughs have been made in the reform of the state commercial banks with substantial improvement in their competitiveness and resilience to shocks.", "At present, balance between supply and demand in the foreign exchange market will mainly be achieved through relaxing the restrictions on the surrender and purchase of foreign exchange by enterprises and individuals.", "Major measures include: reforming the administration of foreign exchange accounts for current account transactions and allowing the enterprises to have greater flexibility in retaining foreign exchange; reforming the management of surrender and purchase of foreign exchange for non-trade transactions by multinational corporations, allowing qualified multinationals in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen to directly make certain foreign exchange payment or to purchase foreign exchange with RMB to make the payment; reforming the policy governing the purchase of foreign exchange by individuals to meet the their reasonable demand for foreign exchange to make current account payment; actively promoting financial innovation to create more opportunities for foreign exchange investment (China Development Bank has issued financial bonds denominated in US dollar in the inter-bank market); introducing pilot reform program of foreign exchange management for overseas investment to gradually expand the channels for capital outflows.", "We are confident that, with the steady advancement of the reforms, a RMB exchange rate system that is suitable to China's specific conditions and accurately reflects market development will be established, and the monetary policy will be playing an increasingly important role in macroeconomic management.", "Canada is an important trade partner of China.", "The trade volume between China and Canada for the first time exceeded USD10 billion in 2003, representing a growth rate of 26.2 percent over the previous year, and the direct investment in China from Canada reached USD563 million.", "Financial cooperation between China and Canada has also been actively promoted.", "Two Canadian commercial banks have established four branches in China and the other four have set up representative offices.", "There are great potentials for trade, investment and financial cooperation between our two countries.", "We look forward to closer financial and economic cooperation with Canada."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
