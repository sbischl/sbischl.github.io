the legislative measures are generally less costly than before for customers; nevertheless, in about a quarter of the cases examined, the new fees are higher than those in place at the end of 2008.", "Banks must rapidly, drastically and definitively simplify the structure of commitment fees.", "Since August the new instructions for calculating the average percentage rates for the purpose of preventing usury envisage the inclusion of all the charges borne by the customer for the disbursement of credit, including costs that had previously been excluded, such as the maximum overdraft fee, where it is still applied, commitment fees and some insurance and broking charges.", "For some categories of transaction, the explicit inclusion of these new items has a significant impact, producing

thresholds and also to curb the amount of ancillary costs.", "c. New rules on transparency and correct conduct In July we issued new rules on the transparency of banking services and correct conduct in relations with customers.", "The use of composite indicators for current accounts will allow customers to compare the costs of the different offers available on the market; the year-end account statements will contain a specific invitation to customers to verify the advantageousness of their existing accounts via the Internet or at their bank.", "The cost of credit facilities will be made more comprehensible, among other things by enabling customers to calculate and compare in advance the potential cost of the overdraft.", "It is not easy to combine simplicity and completeness of information to customers when the products offered are diversified and complex.", "The new rules pay special attention to the less sophisticated customers: standardized documents that can be read at different levels; costs of services clearly indicated; a \"simple current account\" for the basic banking customer, with a fixed yearly account fee; an all-inclusive year-end account statement; practical guides showing consumers how to choose the current account or mortgage that best suits their needs.", "d.

orient the conduct of intermediaries towards higher standards of correctness and transparency; and, by well-organized, efficient handling of complaints that is attentive to the customer's reasons, give intermediaries an incentive to pursue preventive settlement of disputes.", "Appeals to the ABF can be presented at all the branches of the Bank of Italy; special operating units perform the function of technical secretariat for the panels, evaluating whether the documentation submitted by the parties is complete and proper, and carrying out the inquiry.", "An information campaign on the ABF is now under way with a dedicated website and widespread distribution of informational material for customers.", "In this way, we are completing our array of initiatives for the effective improvement in relationships between intermediaries and customers.", "The Community Legislation Implementation Law for 2008 delegates powers to the Government for the comprehensive reordering of the legislation on relations between banks and customers.", "The numerous legislative measures of the past years can be set in a systematic framework that clearly affirms the principles of consumer protection, fills in normative gaps, avoids unjustifiable disparities in the treatment of similar matters, and strengthens the sanction apparatus.", "As I recalled in my earlier testimony before the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the mafia and other criminal organizations, during periods of crisis - when firms and the financial system are most vulnerable to criminal infiltration - action against money-laundering must be even more vigilant and vigorous.", "Strict compliance with the anti-money-laundering rules is not only a legal obligation;

they are supporting them now in the weak recovery that is projected.", "Many have accepted sacrifices in the short term, thus contributing to the soundness of the system, the ability of banks to supply credit to the economy, and the enhancement of their own investment in the long term.", "The crisis has shown how the foundations can go beyond the function expected of institutional investors, which have an authoritative voice while clients are entrusting them with savings to manage, but their voice fades and dies away when savings are withdrawn.", "The foundations' voice does not follow the ups and downs of the markets, and their gaze tends to focus on the medium-long term.", "The crisis has clearly demonstrated the limits of the short-term view, dominated by the rush towards higher and higher returns and exorbitant management fees, which in general have now fallen.", "Following the important mergers of two years ago, the Italian banking system needs stability to meet the management and strategic challenges that exiting the crisis will pose.", "It needs the Foundations to continue to accompany the strengthening of capital and reserves and to persevere in the role of shareholders who are present but do not interfere with management, which has been the basis of their success in recent years.", "The Bank of Italy hopes that the Foundations will continue to demonstrate the same farsightedness that kept them tied to their traditional strategic values at the height of the crisis, and that they will be able to take the long view and contribute to the development of a sound banking system ready to face the challenges of international competition.", "Overcoming the recession and returning to growth Thanks to the powerful support provided by economic policies, the world economy has resumed growing, albeit at modest rates that vary regionally.", "According to the latest IMF forecasts, world output, after falling by more than 1 per cent this year, should increase by around 3 per cent in 2010; the expansion will be fairly moderate in the advanced economies, robust in the emerging and developing countries.", "The downward spiral of our economies in late 2008 and the early part of this year has halted.", "We are less certain that a truly lasting recovery is under way, one that rests on more than the extraordinary support of economic policies.", "In Italy, industrial production has contracted by a quarter since March 2008 and GDP by 6.5 per cent; we are back to the level of twenty years ago in the first case, almost ten years in the second.", "But the most acute phase of the crisis is now past: GDP resumed growth in the third quarter after falling constantly for over a year.", "Although, opinion polls have suggested a more favourable outlook since the spring, the signals coming from the quantitative indicators, particularly domestic demand components, remain weak.", "Household consumption decreased by 2 per cent in the year to September, owing to the contraction in real disposable income and the deterioration in labour market conditions.", "Over the same period employment fell by 3.3 per cent (650,000 jobs), while the ratio of hours of Wage Supplementation to total hours worked rose from 1.5 to 10 per cent of total hours worked.", "Presumably, more jobs will be lost in the closing months of this year.", "Investment fell by 15 per cent in the same period.", "Firms' opinions regarding the conditions for investing, although less pessimistic in our September survey than a few months earlier, do not indicate a strong upturn.", "None of the contractions in output recorded during the various recessions that Italy has experienced since World War II was as large as on the present occasion, and yet it never took less than two years re-gain the pre-recession levels.", "This time, the recovery could take even longer.", "Economic history teaches that recessions caused by financial crises are longer lasting.", "Today, we in Italy have the advantage of a lower level of private debt than other economies and a banking system that has not been damaged directly by the crisis.", "However, we do need to tackle the structural weaknesses of our economy in order to build a lasting recovery that is not founded on exports alone.", "A year ago, on this same occasion, I stressed that the sudden worsening of the crisis necessitated to introduce measures to support demand and the income of the worst-hit social groups, but always with an eye to the constraints imposed by our large public debt.", "Now, the most urgent need is to resume the path of reform to bring the country back, in the years to come, to a high rate of economic growth, which is also the best guarantee of financial stability.", "Financing the Italian economy There is no sign of a turning point in lending, as yet.", "In Italy, lending to business decreased by 3 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter of this year; lending to households continued to expand, but slowly.", "The deceleration was particularly sharp in the case of the leading banking groups, the main users of the international wholesale liquidity markets.", "The refinancing difficulties experienced by the banks have been attenuated, partly thanks to government support and Eurosystem operations, and their liquidity situation is returning to normal, according to the latest results of the weekly monitoring exercise instituted by the Bank of Italy in the autumn of 2007.", "A difficult economic situation reduces the demand for credit, while its supply also becomes tighter.", "This phenomenon was very evident during the worst of the crisis, but now shows signs of easing similar to those found for the euro area as a whole in the ECB's latest Bank Lending Survey.", "The reduction of Eurosystem interest rates led, in Italy, to a generalized lowering of the rates applied to households and firms, similar in scale and pace to the rest of the area.", "In September, the average cost of short-term loans to business was 4 per cent, almost 3 points lower than a year before; variable-rate mortgages for households was cut by more than half, to 2.3 per cent.", "The average cost of fixed-rate mortgages fell by one point, to 4.9 per cent.", "In some sectors, however, notably consumer credit, the cost of borrowing in Italy continues to be higher than in the rest of the euro area.", "In exceptional situations such as the present, variations in creditworthiness are considerable, especially among firms.", "The banks' ability to make the right selection of borrowers becomes crucially important.", "The crisis overtook our productive system at a time when certain sectors were undergoing a laborious reorganization, begun in the middle of this decade.", "This process must now resume, more intense and widespread than before, so that the Italian economy can at last make up the ground lost over the last fifteen years.", "The firms forced to break off the process by market and financial difficulties and those pondering whether to begin it must not be deprived of the intelligent, prudent and selective support of credit.", "This is the greatest contribution that the banking system is called upon to make in order to re-launch our economy."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Financial Regulation", "Banking", "Economic Policy", "Risk Premiums", "Financial Stability", "Capital Requirements", "Liquidity Management", "Credit Risk", "Executive Compensation", "Transparency"]}
