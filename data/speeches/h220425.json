governments, central banks, financial institutions and business - manage the trade-offs we will face along the way.", "Those trade-offs are environmental and economic, as well as political, social, and distributional.", "Managing these effectively is like walking on a tightrope - with a need to maintain the right balance.", "Or put another way, it's not just the destination (net zero by 2050) that matters, the journey (our transition pathway) is important too.", "In the end, the path we take for our planet, economy, and financial system, will ultimately be the sum of myriad individual decisions, not just big commitments.", "We must make those decisions in a timely and informed way with a good understanding of both the intended and unintended consequences they could create.", "That is what I would like to explore today.", "How can we balance on the net-zero tightrope and what role can the Bank of England, working closely with government, play in keeping us steady.", "The Bank of England's role Let me start with the Bank of England's role.", "As the UK's central bank and prudential regulator, the Bank's role in the transition is to understand how different transition pathways could affect the macroeconomy, the stability of the wider financial system, and the safety and soundness of the firms we regulate.", "Our policy response must be calibrated to address the risks that these pathways pose to our objectives.", "The Bank's actions can also help magnify the effects of government climate policy , not least since a resilient financial system will be better able to support the transition.", "Mitigating climate change and solving for the transition is ultimately going to take the combined efforts of government, industry, finance, regulators, and individuals.", "But while we may all have a role to play, it is important to remember that they are not the same roles, and that action by one cannot necessarily substitute for inaction by another.", "Financial regulations cannot substitute for government climate policies, and consumer spending choices cannot substitute for public and private investment.", "Climate action by financial firms That brings me to the financial sector.", "A lot has changed in the past few years.", "We are seeing firms begin to make more serious investments in developing effective capabilities both to manage climate-related financial risks and to identify the opportunities from the transition, whether through more sophisticated climate data analytics or setting firm specific net-zero strategies.", "Regulators like us have played a part in prompting this shift, but so too have the demands and needs of investors and customers.", "We have seen progress, which is welcome.", "However there is still much further to go before capabilities can be considered effective and firms' actions sufficient to support the transition.", "The financial sector's role in the transition is clear.", "It must facilitate the flow of finance to support businesses and households in reducing their emissions and help smooth the adjustment in the real economy.", "But there is a problem.", "External scrutiny on firms' climate actions is increasing, but this tends to focus on their individual actions and the greenness of their lending and investments today, rather than the aggregate outcomes which determine the climate future we face.", "This approach may lead to firms greening their own balance sheets today, not greening the future wider economy.", "And yet the latter is what is ultimately needed to reach net-zero emissions.", "The 'own balance sheet' approach may lead firms or their stakeholders to conclude that they should simply divest from emissions-intensive companies, assets and jurisdictions.", "While this balance sheet-greening - or paper decarbonisation - may reduce the direct risks firms face from transition, it will not reduce the system-wide risks we will all face, unless those actions mean that emissions are actually reduced.", "Put another way, anything one firm does to green its own balance sheet will be undermined where those emissions-intensive activities can continue to be financed by alternative sources that will not steward them toward net-zero.", "Finance needs to support an economy comprised of both green and greening firms.", "Importantly, it also needs to address not only energy supply, but energy demand through improved energy efficiency.", "Indeed this week's IPCC reportOpens in a new window revealed that modelled finance flows for climate mitigation over this decade need to be as much as six times higher than current levels if we are to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.", "Many firms have recognised this and are increasingly adopting active engagement and stewardship strategies to finance the changes that are needed.", "Where this is managed well and there is accountability for delivering change, the results can yield real world impact above and beyond those that divestment alone can deliver.", "The shape and speed of the transition - the signposts for us to follow if you like - is for government to determine.", "But it is subject to uncertainty, and the need to recalibrate, given the long horizons involved.", "Indeed recent events - and the consequent volatility in energy prices - suggest that our path to net zero will be bumpier than we would otherwise have expected.", "But uncertainty over climate policy cannot be an excuse for inaction by the real economy or financial sector.", "The calls for immediate actionOpens in a new window from experts to reduce our future risks get ever louder.", "So we must recognise the need to use climate scenario analysis to explore a range of possible futures as we determine our actions today.", "Our Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario exercise -
