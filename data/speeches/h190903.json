you will already be familiar with these.", "As with the other denominations, we are once again providing information in print and online, and we have of course updated our 'Swiss Banknotes' app.", "The new 100-franc note will be issued starting next Thursday, 12 September 2019, at our counters in Berne and Zurich and at the SNB's agencies.", "For logistical reasons, it will take a few days before the new notes are available country-wide.", "And now, having unveiled the new 100-franc note, I'd like to show you the entire set.", "Here it is: the complete ninth series, inspired by 'The many facets of Switzerland'.", "The vibrant colours and the aesthetically pleasing and intricate design of the series are particularly striking.", "Switzerland's many facets are showcased using core design elements such as the hand, the globe, a Swiss location and an object, which are easily recognisable and recur throughout the banknote series.", "The theme of each note is illustrated via a hand gesture.", "On the 50-franc note, the hand is holding a dandelion, whose seeds are carried away on the wind.", "On the 10-franc note, a conductor's hand sets the tempo for the orchestra.", "The shimmering globe reflects how Switzerland sees itself as part of an interconnected world.", "In the sequence of notes from 1000 francs to 10 francs, the earth rotates once on its axis and passes through one full day.", "The places depicted on the back of the notes are emblematic of various locations in Switzerland.", "Together, the six notes illustrate the diversity of our country.", "The object depicted is linked to each note's key motif.", "On the 20-franc note, the object is a butterfly, and on the 200-franc, a particle collision.", "The key motifs of the six notes are time, light, wind, water, matter and language.", "As I mentioned earlier, the security features are the same for all denominations.", "I hope you like the new banknote series as much as I do.", "Now that all the notes are here, people can choose their own favourite.", "Before I finish, I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to Manuela Pfrunder and her team, and to congratulate them on a tour de force in designing the series.", "And with that, I will hand you over to our Chairman, Thomas Jordan, who will look back over the project and the challenges it presented, both for the SNB and for our partners."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["New banknote series", "100-franc note", "Security features", "Humanitarian tradition", "Water", "Switzerland", "Issuance process", "Design elements", "Key motifs", "Swiss Banknotes app"]}
