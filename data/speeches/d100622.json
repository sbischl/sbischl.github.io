"Ladies and Gentlemen: Under Vision 2030, Kenya aspires to become an international financial hub.", "In this regard, I am aware that efforts are currently underway towards the realisation of this

expanding cities and towns increases productivity growth and overall hinterland growth.", "As a result, the thought by Nakuru Business Association of making Nakuru a financially vibrant town is not misplaced.", "What you need to do is to concretize your ideas into a plan of course drawn from the Vision 2030, and to expand the city to provide a diversified economy.", "To assist in this line, it

to take advantage of this.", "Over the last ten years, the trend has drastically changed with a continued drop in the level of non-performing loans from as high as 38 percent of gross advances in 2002

are at advanced stages.", "We expect the Nakuru currency centre to commence operations by end of July 2010.", "This centre will be housed by KCB.", "Besides benefitting Nakuru residents by getting clean notes and coins, it is expected that the costs saved by banks from the lower transportation costs will translate to better, cost effective and efficient services to the customers.", "I must emphasize that the centres are a joint partnership between the Central Bank and commercial banks via KBA.", "The centres should therefore not be confused with the Central Bank's operated branches.", "In the case of currency centers, commercial banks provide the physical infrastructure while CBK provides the necessary human and technical support necessary.", "In the long run, the CBK will leave currency distribution to be handled by commercial banks.", "Finally, let me touch on three issues that featured in the budget and I think they are critical to our discussions today: The revamping of
