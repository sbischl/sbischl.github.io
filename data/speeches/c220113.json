Emefiele, CON At the Official Launching of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) Thursday, 25th November, 2021 Good afternoon, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen.", "I am pleased to welcome you to the official launching of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES), an intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria aimed at addressing the dual challenge of youth unemployment and underemployment in Nigeria.", "The Scheme, developed in partnership with Nigerian polytechnics and universities, is designed to harness the potentials of graduate entrepreneurs by creating a paradigm shift from the pursuit of white-collar jobs to a culture of entrepreneurship for economic development and job creation.", "As you are all aware, at the occasion of the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos, in July 2021, I delivered the convocation lecture titled, National Development and Knowledge Economy in the Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs into the 21st Century.", "At that event, I promised that the Central Bank will seek fresh collaboration with the nation's tertiary institutions to develop entrepreneurship programmes, and to support-through the provision of access to finance-graduates and undergraduates who have bankable ideas, to bring the ideas to fruition.", "Engagements have been on-going between the Central Bank and the leadership of some of our tertiary institutions regarding the framework for an innovative financing model that will support entrepreneurship development among our graduates and undergraduates.", "This launch of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme today, is a culmination of the engagements and fulfillment of that promise.", "With about 600,000 students graduating yearly from Nigerian tertiary institutions, and without the commensurate employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors, it has become imperative that government, at all levels, puts in place policy measures to support entrepreneurial development among our youth.", "Such measures would create an enabling business ecosystem that supports innovation and enables the youth to unleash their entrepreneurial potential, by redirecting their focus from seeking white-collar jobs to a culture of entrepreneurship development.", "The ecosystem should provide support in re- orientating, training, and providing a financing model apt to the peculiarity of the sector within which the businesses operate.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, entrepreneurship is an integral part of any economy, and entrepreneurs play a key role in driving growth and innovation, which in turn results in job creation.", "In line with its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, and its developmental mandate of ensuring inclusive growth in the economy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has introduced several programmes that create an ecosystem that allows the flow of affordable credit to the real sector.", "These interventions are industry-led and designed to support the resilience of targeted priority sectors and segments for growth and jobs creation.", "With an estimated population of 213 million, out of which two-third are youth, aged under 35 years, the nation is faced with a historic opportunity, particularly as the demography continues to create clear evidence of their relevance to economic development, as accentuated by the global recognition of Nigerian tech start-ups and continued growth of businesses in the technology space owned by the youth.", "In realization of this, the CBN has introduced several innovative financing programmes designed to extend low-cost financing to youth entrepreneurs across the country.", "These interventions have continued to receive resounding commendations, as they have proven effective in extending credit to youth entrepreneurs across the country.", "For instance, under its Targeted Credit Facility (TCF), the Bank has disbursed a total of \u20a6363.49 billion to 766,719 beneficiaries, comprising 638,070 households and 128, 649 small businesses.", "Under its Agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS), the Bank has released \u20a6134.63 billion to 37,571 entrepreneurs.", "Disbursements under the NYIF stood at \u20a63.00 billion to 7,057 small business beneficiaries.", "Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, as part of measures to promote entrepreneurship development among the graduate and undergraduate youths of Nigerian polytechnics and universities, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) in October 2021, with the release of the implementation guidelines and the opening of the portal for submission of applications.", "The Scheme is aimed at providing an innovative financing model that will support the development of innovative entrepreneurial ideas among graduates and undergraduates of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.", "Today's official launch of the TIES and subsequent inauguration of the Body of Experts (BoE) for the Scheme's Developmental Component is a testimony of the important roles the youth play in building new blocks for economic growth, particularly as our national growth is highly dependent on a strong and competitive businesses.", "Bridging their financing gaps and enhancing access to low-cost credit to drive development of business is a task that can only be addressed by an innovative financing model that correlates with the complexity and dynamics of these small businesses.", "Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, let me state that the Scheme was designed to address three (3) verticals of the segment, i.", "The Term Loan Component - provides direct credit opportunities to graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities of not more than seven years post- graduation.", "An applicant, if successful, shall be eligible for a maximum of \u20a65 million for an individual, sole- proprietorship or small company; and a maximum of \u20a625 million for a partnership or company.", "The tenor for the facility is maximum of five (5) years, with a one- year moratorium, and at an interest of 5 per cent per annum, which shall revert to 9 per cent from March 2022.", "The pilot phase of the Scheme is presently being implemented through the Bank of Industry (BOI) with the development of an application portal and processing of submitted applications.", "The Equity Investment Component - is designed to support start-ups, existing businesses requiring expansion, and ailing businesses seeking resuscitation.", "The Component shall be implemented under the Bank's AgSMEIS Equity Window.", "Thus, the investment limit shall be subject to the limit prescribed by the AGSMEIS Guidelines and the investment period
