by the Reserve Bank 15.", "Let me now detail some recent initiatives by the Reserve Bank regarding consumer a) Most important perhaps was the release of a Charter of Customer Rights, which enshrined broad, overarching principles for protection of bank customers and enunciates the \"five\" basic rights of bank customers.", "These are: (i) Right to Fair Treatment; (ii) Right to Transparency; Fair and Honest Dealing; (iii) Right to Suitability; (iv) Right to Privacy; and (v) Right to Grievance Redress and Compensation.", "The Reserve Bank also advised the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) and the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) to formulate a \"Model Customer Rights Policy\" encapsulating the principles enshrined in the Charter.", "Initially, all the scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and urban co-operative banks are expected to prepare their own Board approved policy incorporating the five basic rights of the Charter which, among other things, would contain a monitoring and oversight mechanism for ensuring adherence.", "b) The Reserve Bank of India undertook several measures on KYC, including releasing a note along with a poster and a booklet comprising a few common questions relating to Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts.", "The objective of this is to bring awareness among the general public about the KYC simplification measures taken by the Reserve Bank in the recent times with a view to helping the common man in opening bank accounts.", "c) The measures taken for simplification of KYC include prescribing a single document for proof of identity and proof of address, removing the requirement for separate proof of address for current address, making KYC a bank process rather than a branch process, relaxing the officially valid documents (OVDs) for low risk customers, increasing the time intervals for periodic updation of KYC for existing low / medium and high risk customers from 5/2/1 years to 10/8/2 years, respectively.", "d) Further, banks need not seek fresh proofs of identity and address at the time of periodic updation, from those customers who are categorised as \"low risk\", in case of no change in status with respect to their identities and addresses.", "A selfcertification by the customer to that effect should suffice in such cases.", "Banks may not insist on physical presence of such low risk customer at the time of periodic updation.", "Further, if an existing KYC compliant customer of a bank desires to open another account in the same bank, there should be no need for submission of fresh proof of identity and / or proof of address for the purpose.", "Further, Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators were allowed to act as Customer Service Point (CSP) for e-KYC purpose.", "e) To mitigate the difficulties faced by transgender persons in opening accounts, banks were directed to include \"third gender\" in all forms / applications, etc.", "f) Initiatives were taken to further enhance transparency in pricing of credit, based on the recommendations of Working Group on Pricing of Credit.", "Banks were advised to display on their website inter alia, the interest rate range of contracted loans for the past quarter for different categories of advances granted to individual borrowers along with mean interest rates for such loans; the total fees and charges applicable on various types of loans to individual borrower which should also be disclosed at the time of processing of loan for transparency and comparability and to facilitate informed decision making by customers; Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or such similar other arrangement of representing the total cost of credit on a loan to an individual borrower so as to allow customers to compare the costs associated with borrowing across products and / or lenders.", "Apart from displaying such information, banks were also advised to provide a clear, concise, one page key fact statement / fact sheet, to all individual borrowers at every stage of the loan processing as well as in case of any change in any terms and conditions, which would also be included as a summary box to be displayed in the credit agreement.", "g) While undertaking insurance distribution business, either under the corporate agency or broking model under the relevant IRDA Regulations, banks were directed to put in place a system of assessment of the suitability of products for customers, and classify products into universally suitable products and complex products which necessarily require customer need assessment prior to sale.", "It should be ensured that there is a standardized system of assessing the needs of the customer and that initiation / transactional and approval processes are segregated.", "Banks should treat their customers fairly, honestly and transparently, with regard to suitability and appropriateness of the insurance product sold.", "There should be no violation either of Section 10(1) (ii) of the BR Act, 1949 or the guidelines issued by IRDA in payment of commissions / brokerage / incentives.", "This may be factored in while formulating a suitable performance assessment and incentive structure for staff.", "Further, it must be ensured that no incentive (cash or non-cash) should be paid to the staff engaged in insurance broking / corporate agency services by the insurance company.", "The bank should not follow any restrictive practices of forcing a customer to either opt for products of a specific insurance company or link sale of such products to any banking product.", "It should be prominently stated in all publicity material distributed by the bank that the purchase by a bank's customer of any insurance products is purely voluntary, and is not linked to availment of any other facility from the bank.", "Further, the details of fees / brokerage received in respect of insurance broking / agency business undertaken by them should be disclosed in the \"Notes to Accounts\" to their Balance Sheet.", "A robust internal grievance redressal mechanism should be put in place along with a Board approved customer compensation policy for resolving issues related to services offered.", "It must also ensure that the insurance companies whose products are being sold have robust customer grievance redressal arrangements in place.", "Further, the bank must facilitate the redressal of grievances of the customer.", "h) To encourage the usage of credit and debit cards, Reserve Bank has issued various instructions on security of card transactions and risk mitigation measures, including directions on online alerts as well as on additional factor of authentication which have significantly increased customer confidence in using cards.", "Some initiatives taken recently are as under: \u2022 To avoid inconvenience, the requirement of Additional Factor of Authentication for small value card present transactions was relaxed for customers making small value payments on contactless cards up to a maximum value of \u20b9 2,000/- per transaction subject to certain conditions.", "\u2022 Banks were also advised in the interest of customer awareness and protection to clearly explain to customers about the technology, its use, and risks while issuing such contact less cards; indicate the maximum liability devolving on the customer, if any, at the time of issuance of such cards along with the responsibility of the customer to report the loss of such cards to the bank; and to put in place robust mechanism for seamless reporting of lost / stolen cards, which can be accessed through multiple channels.", "\u2022 To further put in place risk mitigation measures for customers using various types of cards, banks are advised that with effect from Feb 1, 2016 all new cards issued - debit and credit, domestic and international - by banks shall be EMV chip and pin based cards.", "i) To alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners who are deprived of regular pension payments in case of misplacement of life certificates, all agency banks handling government pension payments were advised to issue a duly signed acknowledgement to pensioners on receipt of the life certificate submitted in physical form.", "Banks were also advised to promote the use of digital life certificates among pensioners, which would eliminate the need for physical presence at branches and issue of acknowledgement.", "j) To ensure transparency in the promotional material and to build an enduring relationship with the customers, correlate a product brand name to the name of the entity / company authorised under the PSS Act, all authorised entities issuing payment products were advised that all the information available to the public regarding the product as advertisements, on website, application form, etc.", "should prominently carry the name of the entity / company authorised by RBI under the PSS Act.", "k) Banks were advised to ensure that penal charges on non-maintenance of minimum balances in savings bank accounts are directly proportionate to the extent of shortfall observed, reasonable and not out of line with the average cost of providing the services that the balance in the savings account does not turn into negative balance solely on account of levy of charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance the bank should notify the customer clearly by SMS / email / letter etc.", "that in the event of the minimum balance not being restored in the account within a month from the date of notice, penal charges will be applicable.", "In case the minimum balance is not restored within a reasonable period, which shall not be less than one month from the date of notice of shortfall, penal charges may be recovered under intimation to the account holder.", "l) To further boost the quality of customer service and to ensure that there is undivided attention to resolution of customer complaints in banks, all public sector banks and select private sector and foreign banks were advised to appoint an internal ombudsman thereby providing a forum available to bank customers for grievance redressal before they approach the Banking Ombudsman.", "m) Apart from issuing instructions to banks, the Reserve Bank also issues cautionaries to members of the general public.", "We cautioned members of the public against an app (application) doing rounds on WhatsApp purportedly to facilitate checking of balance in customers' bank accounts.", "n) The Reserve Bank of India also cautioned the public against Multi-level Marketing (MLM) activities explaining the functioning of these entities, and advising that falling prey to such offers can result in direct financial losses, apart from the fact that these are cognizable offences under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Act Some lingering questions 16.", "I understand that in many a depositor's mind, several questions linger and they eagerly await the regulator's response.", "As I understand, it is not the answer they seek but the rationale and explanation for our actions and the so called \"inactions\".", "It is our duty to explain.", "Let me discuss some of these contemporary issues and questions.", "First issue that I want to discuss relates to deposit insurance.", "More specifically, the issue relating to increasing the limit on deposit insurance cover.", "Deposit Insurance protects depositors against the loss of their deposits in case a deposit institution is not able to meet its obligation to the insured depositors.", "In India, the commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Local Area Banks (LABs) and co-operative banks are covered by deposit insurance.", "There has been a persistent demand from stakeholders and public representatives in the recent past for a hike in deposit insurance cover from the current level of \u20b91 lakh.", "The Deposit Insurance Systems around the world have evolved over time by reforms adopted by various jurisdictions based on experience, international developments, guidance from supra national bodies like IMF, International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI and other environmental changes from time to time.", "One of the basic principles of deposit insurance is that the deposit insurance system should cover at least 80% of the deposit accounts and 20-30% of the total assessable deposits.", "In India, we have surpassed this norm in a substantial way; as on March 31, 2015, our DICGC's deposit insurance covers as high as 92.3% of the deposit accounts and 31% of the total assessable deposits.", "Therefore, before deciding on this demand, we have to factor in two major issues viz., the moral hazard issue and the risk based premium issue.", "Deposit insurance inherently creates a moral hazard i.e.", "the parties to the deposit insurance viz.", "a bank and its insured depositors get an incentive to take more risk because the costs of risk, in whole or in part, are borne by others, generally a deposit insurance agency, in our case the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).", "Most deposit insurance systems initially adopt an ex-ante flat-rate premium system because they are relatively simple to design, implement and administer.", "However, these systems were open to criticism in that they do not reflect the level of risk that banks pose to the deposit insurance system.", "Flat-rate premium systems have also been viewed as being unfair as \"low-risk\" banks are required to pay the same premium as \"higher-risk\" banks.", "With no inbuilt incentive for \"higher risk\" banks to improve their risk profile, a flat rate system would accentuate the moral hazard problem.", "Therefore the primary objective of most differential premium systems has been to provide incentives for banks to avoid excessive risk taking, minimise moral hazard and introduce more fairness into the premium assessment process.", "Introducing fairness into the system bolsters industry support for deposit insurance.", "A hike in cover without calibrating the premium rates to the risk profile of the insured banks only exacerbates the moral hazard.", "Recognising this, a Committee on Differential Premium System for Banks in India (Chairman: Shri Jasbir Singh) has been constituted by DICGC and has submitted its Report yesterday.", "We hope that introduction of Risk Based Premium system will make ground for considering raising the insurance cover from the present ceiling of \u20b9 1 lakh.", "Structure of differentiated banks and consumer protection 19.", "You have noticed that we have recently granted \"in principle\" licenses to 11 entities to form Payments Banks in the country; and several of you nurture a vague feeling about how these differentiated banks will subserve consumers interests.", "I want to explain to you how we have carefully structured the regulatory arrangements of these banks from the perspective of consumer protection.", "As you will recall, consequent to the discussion paper called \"Banking Structure in India - The Way Forward\", brought out by the Reserve Bank in August 2013, and the recommendations of the Committee headed by Shri Nachiket Mor, on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low-Income Households to look into the issues relating to financial inclusion, in November 2014 we announced our intention to grant licenses to two types of differentiated banks viz., the Payments Banks and the Small Finance Banks.", "The objective of setting up of Payments Banks will be to further financial inclusion; the strategies will be by providing (i) small savings accounts and (ii) payments / remittance services to migrant labour workforce, low income households, small businesses, other unorganised sector entities and other users.", "The scope of the activities permitted for the Payment Banks included a.", "Acceptance of demand deposits.", "Payments Bank will initially be restricted to holding a maximum balance of \u20b9 1 lakh per individual customer, b.", "Issuance of ATM / debit cards c. Payments and remittance services through various channels and some ancillary activities.", "The deposits collected by them can be only in current or savings account; they cannot accept fixed deposits.", "The payments banks are prohibited from lending activity.", "They can deploy the deposits largely in government securities only; a small portion, up to 25% of their deposits, can be held in deposits with other banks.", "The consumer protection aspects of the design are as follows: The public deposits in the Payments Banks will be covered by the deposit insurance of the DICGC.", "As the deposit ceiling is \u20b9 1 lakh and the deposit insurance ceiling is also \u20b9 1 lakh, it means that the depositors of the Payments Banks will be fully insured.", "Actually, there were arguments why Payments Banks should be covered under deposit insurance, when their assets will be fully in high quality liquid assets of government securities and high credit bank accounts.", "Still, we concluded that such an assurance as deposit insurance is needed for the depositors of payments banks, as the concept is new and depositors will need additional confidence.", "As the payments bank may operate in remote areas mostly through BCs, ATMs and other networks, the payments bank will be required to have at least 25 per cent of physical access points including BCs in rural centres.", "Further, we require that a controlling office for a cluster of access points should also be established for control over various outlets and customer grievance redressal.", "We have insisted that the bank should have a high powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints.", "The payments banks will also come under the purview of RBI's Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006. .", "Now, let me explain the arduous process we adopted for granting \"in principle\" licence.", "I want to emphasize here that granting banking licenses is not a tick box exercise; it needs to be based on the high regulatory comfort about the \"fit and proper\" position of those who will manage the bank.", "Further, banks are high leverage organisations; and whose moneys they leverage?", "They actually leverage public deposits.", "Should we not require highest degree of assurance about the entities with whom public moneys can be entrusted?", "Will this not actually mean, as we said in our Guidelines, licenses shall be issued on a very selective basis.", "The licensing authority has to apply its mind and exercise judgment.", "To do this, we had multiple layers of checks so that the exercise is not arbitrary.", "Actually, we had five layers of assessment - the first round was the preliminary scrutiny by staff based on eligibility criteria, the second round was a detailed analysis of applications by staff after information collection, including from agencies, the third round by an external committee comprising people with high integrity and expertise, the fourth round by the internal committee, and the fifth round by the Committee of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank.", "We are convinced that our decision to adopt the cautious approach in licensing of payments banks in the initial years is very prudent and sound.", "Another care that we have taken is to keep intact the difference between authorising financial service providers versus licensing financial product purveyors.", "The Financial Service Providers do not deal in the consumers' money; they only render broking, agency and / or advisory services to the consumers.", "Whereas, the financial product purveyors like the banks, mutual funds and insurance companies, actually receive moneys from the consumers and manage those moneys.", "This handling of public moneys need a totally different regulatory approach, as compared to handling of servicing the consumers through agency or advisory function.", "That is why the prudential regulations on the former are much more stringent than the conduct regulations on the latter.", "It clearly follows that while the liberal authorisations may be possible in the case of service providers, cautious authorisations will be needed in the case of authorisations of banks.", "We have also announced that we will license Small Finance Banks, another new set of differentiated banks.", "The objective of setting up of small finance banks, like the payments banks, is also to further financial inclusion; however, it is sought to be achieved through a different set of strategies viz., (i) provision of savings vehicles primarily to unserved and underserved sections of the population, and (ii) supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal farmers; micro and small industries; and other unorganised sector entities, through high technology-low cost operations.", "The small finance bank, in furtherance of the objectives for which it will be set up, shall primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganised sector entities.", "It can also undertake other non-risk sharing simple financial services activities, not requiring any commitment of own fund, such as distribution of mutual fund units, insurance products, pension products, etc.", "The prudential guidelines for the Small Finance banks have been suitably tweaked.", "It will be required to extend 75 per cent of its Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as priority sector lending (PSL).", "The maximum loan size and investment limit exposure to a single and group obligor would be restricted to 10 per cent and 15 per cent of its capital funds, respectively.", "Further, in order to ensure that the bank extends loans primarily to small borrowers, at least 50 per cent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to \u20b9 25 lakh.", "Keeping customer protection requirement in view, we have prescribed that the Small Finance Banks should have high powered Customer Grievances Cell to handle customer complaints and the small finance banks will come under the purview of RBI's Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006. .", "We have received 72 applications and are in the final stages of determining who all can be granted licenses.", "At the cost of repetition, I want to emphasize here also that granting banking licenses is not a tick box exercise; it needs to be based on the high regulatory comfort about the \"fit and proper\" position of those who will manage the bank.", "The Small Finance Banks are also high leverage organisations, and we require highest degree of assurance about the entities with whom public moneys can be entrusted.", "Therefore, licences shall be issued on a very selective basis only; we will soon announce grant of licenses to the selected applicants.", "Market development and customer protection 31.", "As regulators we often face the dilemma of market development or market innovations versus customer protection.", "We are still a developing and emerging market; while in several respects we have reached international standards, there are still quite a sizable segments in the financial sector that needs development and innovations.", "Financial inclusion is a case in point.", "New ideas need to be encouraged; initial cost which will be typically high needs to be recovered; initial period risks and failures need adequate return and compensation.", "On the other hand, these compulsions will militate against consumer protection.", "As regulators, we recognise this dilemma.", "We did face this dilemma in recent years in the cases of micro finance institutions, the ATMs, credit and debit cards, the electronic fund transfer services like the RTGS and NEFT and even the cash services.", "We were convinced about the need for expansion of these services and conveniences; we understood the trade-offs between the charges for these services and the consumer interests.", "Our approach has been a gradual move from facilitating entrenchment of such developments and innovations by ensuring competition and choices for consumers to a fairer treatment of consumers and fair charges.", "Life in low interest rate regime 32.", "Now, I would like to paint the scenario that will emerge in our country in the next few years and some preparations that all of us as savers should be undertaking.", "For a very long period, more specifically in our own living memory of the post-Independence era, India had been going through high inflationary period;
