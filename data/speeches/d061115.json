poverty among this sector of the population is almost 25 percent.", "Here I note that this subject is dealt with through increasing allowances to the elderly who have no sources of income, as is the case in the budget for 2005 and 2006. .", "The Arab and ultra-orthodox sectors This last matter concerns the two sectors of the population that have the highest concentrations of poor in Israel.", "Among the Arab population, the level of poverty was higher than 55 percent last year, and among the ultra-orthodox it was 63 percent.", "The reasons for this are, for the Arab population, connected to education, discrimination in the labor market and the low level of participation of women in the labor force.", "Among the ultra-orthodox, the problem is related to size of families and the low level of participation, particularly among men, in the labor market.", "Also in these cases, it is important to build a series of tailored tools to extricate these populations from these extremely high rates of poverty.", "Sustainable growth Now I will turn to the long term: Today the economy is at a very important crossroads.", "We are obligated to safeguard the enormous achievements of the economy, and the confidence that investors have in us, in order to improve the chances that this growth will continue in the long run.", "Clearly what is important for the economy and the state is sustainable growth.", "If we can grow at a rate of 5.5 percent in the next 10 years, and if the population continues to grow at a rate of 1.7 percent, then our income per head will reach $ 29,000;

secondly, our heavy burden of public debt encumbers the government with the heavy costs of interest rate payments - reaching up to 15 percent of the government budget, the second largest single item after defense spending.", "It would be preferable if some of these monies were redirected to necessities such as education, welfare etc; and thirdly, the high burden of debt-to-GDP exposes the economy to possible external shocks.", "And how do we lower this debt-to-GDP ratio?", "In the denominator, we must create growth, and in the numerator, low budget deficits.", "It is therefore important that in the years after 2007, the budget policy allows the budget deficit to return to its path we saw prior to the fighting, which will emphasize the government's commitment to long-term budget targets and will demonstrate that the deviation in 2007 was an exception.", "C.
