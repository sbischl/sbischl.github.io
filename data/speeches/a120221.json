Inflation Report mainly owing to the euro area.", "Thus, projections for export-weighted global growth index for Turkey also pointed to a lower pace of growth for external demand (Chart 15).", "Hence, we based our inflation forecasts on an outlook of weaker external demand compared to the previous period.", "Export-Weighted Global Economic Activity Index* (2009Q1=100) * For methodology, see

forecasts upwards for the second half of 2011 considering the stronger-than-expected economic activity in the third quarter.", "Meanwhile, due to the deterioration in the global growth outlook, we estimate that aggregate demand conditions will provide a stronger support to disinflation in the medium term compared to the previous reporting period.", "We also revised our assumptions for commodity and oil prices slightly upwards.", "Considering the recent developments and futures prices, we revised our assumptions for oil prices upwards from USD 100 to USD 110 per barrel for 2012 and to USD 105 for 2013.", "Accordingly, our assumptions for import prices were also subject to a slight upward revision (Chart 16).", "In addition, we preserved our assumptions for the annual rate of increase in

"Source: CBRT, TurkStat.", "Inflation and Monetary Policy Outlook Now, I would like to present our inflation and output gap forecasts based on the outlook I have described so far.", "When forming our forecasts, we assumed that the tight monetary policy stance will be sustained for a while; and consequently, annualized loan growth rate will hover around 15 percent and the Turkish lira will display a mild appreciation trend.", "Accordingly, inflation is expected to be, with 70 percent probability, between 5.1 and 7.9 percent with a mid-point of 6.5 percent at the end of 2012, and between 3.3 and 6.9 percent with a mid-point of 5.1 percent at the end of 2013.", "We expect inflation to stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term (Chart 17).", "Inflation and Output Gap Forecasts * Shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast.", "Overall, although demand and cost conditions have not changed notably since the publication of the October Report, we revised our inflation forecasts for end-2012 upwards due to higher initial point (the initial point referring to the latest inflation data before the forecast period) resulting from higher-than-expected inflation during the past three months.", "As elaborated on in the Report as well, cumulative increases in the exchange rate and commodity prices coupled with soaring unprocessed food prices and the developments in administered prices pushed inflation to high levels in 2011.", "We estimate that inflation will remain flat in the first quarter and exhibit a gradual downtrend starting from the second quarter (Chart 17).", "Our tight monetary policy stance since October prevents a deterioration in the price setting behavior by keeping inflation expectations under control.", "Thus, we expect that inflation will follow a downward trend as the accumulated effects of the temporary price movements on annual inflation gradually fade away.", "Thus, we estimate that inflation will display a notable decline particularly in the last quarter of 2012.", "Before moving on to the risks regarding the inflation outlook, there is a particular subject I would like to touch upon.", "As you might have noticed, I have given an inflation forecast that exceeds our end-year inflation target of 5 percent.", "This is because we think that pulling inflation towards the target by end-2012 would prove to be quite costly.", "Reducing inflation from the current level of 10.45 percent to 5-percent-target within 12 months would lead to unfavorable fluctuations in economic activity; accordingly we think that it is more reasonable to bring inflation back to the target in one and a half year.", "Thus, our baseline scenario envisages inflation to reach the target of 5 percent by mid-2013 (Chart 17).", "However, the target might be attained by the end of 2012, should the risk appetite improve markedly in the forthcoming period and the capital flows towards emerging economies re-accelerate, leading to a stronger appreciation of the Turkish lira than assumed in our baseline scenario.", "At this point, I would like to emphasize that any new data or information regarding the inflation outlook may lead to a change in the monetary policy stance.", "Therefore, assumptions regarding the monetary policy outlook underlying our inflation forecasts should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf of the CBRT.", "Risks and Monetary Policy In the last part of my speech, I would like to share our assessment of the risks on inflation outlook.", "The first of these risks is the possibility of second round effects that might stem from inflation hovering at high levels in the short term.", "Three-month accumulated increase in consumer prices in the final quarter of 2011 was 5.66 percent.", "This will stay in annual inflation figure for another three quarters.", "Therefore, it is highly likely that annual inflation will stay significantly above the target until the last quarter of the year, even if the underlying trend in the forthcoming period eases to levels consistent with the target.", "Although the monetary tightening delivered by the CBRT since October has reduced the possibility of second round effects, I would like to emphasize that inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken to keep medium-term inflation outlook consistent with the target.", "Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy call for a continuation of a flexible approach in monetary policy.", "The medium term outlook presented in the Report assumes that problems in the euro area will be resolved gradually and the global outlook will not deteriorate further.", "However, the probability that the solution of the problems may take a more protracted and painful process poses downside risks regarding the global growth and risk appetite.", "On the other hand, perceptions regarding the global economic outlook may turn more favorable than expected, should the measures taken towards the solution are completed sooner and more decisively than envisaged.", "Such a situation, coupled with the ongoing quantitative easing policies pursued by the central banks of advanced economies, may improve risk appetite and re-accelerate capital flows towards emerging economies.", "Overall, ongoing problems in the euro area and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of measures aimed at solving these problems suggest that global financial markets will continue to be volatile in the forthcoming period.", "These conditions necessitate a flexible approach in monetary policy, which utilizes multiple instruments.", "I would like to underline once more that the CBRT will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the required measures promptly.", "Another risk on the inflation outlook is the uncertainty regarding oil prices.", "Although weak global outlook dampens commodity prices, rising problems of oil supply have recently posed upside risks on energy prices.", "I would like to reiterate that should such a risk materialize, the CBRT will not respond to temporary price movements, yet will not tolerate any deterioration in expectations.", "We will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while formulating monetary policy.", "In this respect, our baseline forecasts take the Medium Term Program as given and thus assume that fiscal discipline will be maintained.", "A revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.", "We will continue to focus on price stability in the formulation of the monetary policy while preserving financial stability as a supplementary objective.", "To this end, we will carefully assess the impact of the macroprudential measures taken by the CBRT and other institutions on the inflation outlook.", "We are of the opinion that strengthening the structural reform agenda that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the saving deficit would support the relative improvement of Turkey's sovereign risk, and thus facilitate price stability and financial stability in the medium term.", "This will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and contribute to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.", "In this respect, I would like to end my remarks reminding you the importance of the steps towards implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term Program.", "Thank you very much for your participation."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
