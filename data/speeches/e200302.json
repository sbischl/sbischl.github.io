the second type - are different, as they typically pull inflation and output in opposite directions.", "A sharp exogenous increase in oil prices, for example, pushes inflation up while harming growth and employment.", "To minimise volatility in economic activity, supply shocks therefore usually require a smoother and more protracted policy response.", "The implication is that central banks generally choose to bring inflation back to their aim over horizons of different length.", "The choice of the horizon, in turn, depends, among other things, on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks hitting the economy, as well as on the speed and scope of the transmission of monetary impulses to prices and wages, which may vary with the use of different instruments.", "Supply-side shocks typically imply longer horizons than demand-side shocks.", "And while central banks can usually afford to \"look through\" temporary shocks, more persistent shocks that risk destabilising inflation expectations may require a shorter horizon.", "I will come back to this later.", "For the ECB, this means that the length of the \"medium term\" - which is an integral part of its definition of price stability - will vary over time.", "In reality, of course, economies are constantly hit by a wide variety of shocks, and central banks often have only a limited understanding of the precise configuration of the forces pushing inflation in either direction, which complicates the conduct of monetary policy.", "Over the past few weeks, for example, the dramatic events around the spread of the coronavirus have increased uncertainty about the global growth outlook, and also the outlook for the euro area.", "But very little is yet known about the potential medium-term implications.", "Today I will focus on other, more slow-moving structural factors that may influence the transmission of monetary policy to inflation.", "I will start from the question as to why inflation has not seen more persistent upward pressure despite years of exceptional monetary stimulus.", "There are several competing hypotheses.", "The first hypothesis is that unconventional policy instruments have been ineffective.", "Although we have not yet heard the final word on this topic, in my opinion the available empirical evidence broadly dismisses this view.", "The use of these instruments has substantially loosened financing conditions, with beneficial effects for economic growth, employment and inflation.", "Unconventional policy instruments had considerable positive impact Source: ECB calculations.", "Notes: The calculations are based on estimates by Eurosystem experts and the estimates in Rostagno et al.", "The estimates of Eurosystem experts are based on various modelling methods, from purely structural models to time series models.", "A second hypothesis is that economic slack may still be larger than conventional indicators suggest.", "Estimates by international organisations suggest that slack in the euro area has diminished measurably over the past few years and that, by and large, the output gap in the euro area has closed.", "Uncertainty over the remaining degree of economic slack...

the euro area economy.", "But such indicators come with two caveats.", "The first is that they \"reverse engineer\" - that is, inflation, or the lack thereof, is always and everywhere attributed to economic slack.", "And the second caveat is that they are difficult to reconcile with both survey-based and hard data-based indicators of slack in the labour market, which even point to growing signs of labour shortages.", "...but growing signs of shortages in labour markets Importantly, improvements in the labour market have not been confined to headline unemployment.", "Over the past few years we have observed a marked decline in the number of discouraged workers and underemployed part-time workers (Slide 3, left panel).", "ECB estimates suggest that current broad labour market conditions do not differ much from those observed just before the outbreak of the global financial crisis.", "The question, then, is why inflation remains so muted, which brings me to the third hypothesis: the view that other, mostly supply-side factors may currently be weighing on inflation.", "Phillips curve estimates by ECB staff visualise this idea.", "Reduction of slack putting upward pressure on wages and prices These estimates, which are based on a large number of economic activity indicators, suggest that the erosion of economic slack - the yellow bars - has progressively contributed to pushing up both wages and prices.", "At the same time, however, these estimates currently leave a large part of underlying inflation unexplained.", "It is possible that these residuals reflect measurement errors, for example regarding economic slack.", "But they may also reflect, at least in part, other structural factors that are more difficult to identify and quantify.", "One way to gauge the potential role of these factors is to analyse the wealth of available financial market data, focusing on inflation expectations rather than actual inflation.", "Supply shocks likely contributed to

expectations has been due to the weakening in aggregate demand - the yellow area - at the time of the sovereign debt crisis, and again in 2018 on the back of the deterioration in the global growth outlook.", "But you can also see that a substantial part of the cumulative decline in inflation expectations may be due to supply-side factors.", "Indeed, in the hypothetical absence of these supply-side shocks, ten-year inflation-linked swaps could currently be trading at levels much closer to 2%.", "Supply shocks likely contributed to decline in market-based inflation expectations

and to what extent, they affect inflation over time.", "Collectively, however, they are likely to explain part of the protracted weakness in inflation.", "I would like to discuss two such structural factors and their potential implications for the ECB's mediumterm horizon.", "The first factor relates to changes in the energy sector, in particular the pervasive effects of the shale oil revolution and changes to the transmission of oil price shocks.", "And the second factor relates to the pricing behaviour of firms and their ability to buffer cost-push shocks through changes in their profit margins.", "The changing role of energy in inflation dynamics The rise in energy prices was a prime contributor to euro area HICP inflation before the outbreak of the global financial crisis.", "Marked fall in the contribution of energy to headline inflation Shares of the main HICP aggregates in average HICP inflation Source: Eurostat and ECB calculations It accounted, on average, for 23% of

zero.", "So the measurable and persistent decline in the contribution of energy prices to inflation has been one major source of low inflation in recent years.", "What is less clear, however, are the causes of the fall in the contribution of energy price inflation and whether the effects can be expected to persist in the future.", "Energy inflation has so far been predominantly driven by the price of oil, which fluctuates in line with supply and demand.", "For monetary policy, the distinction between supply and demand matters much along the same lines I described before.", "Falling oil prices, for example, are often a symptom of a broader weakness in global aggregate demand, in which case they send important signals for monetary policy in real time.", "Since about 2014, however, model-based analysis has suggested that the predominant source of the decline in oil prices is likely to reflect supply-side factors.", "Overhang in oil inventories weighing on oil prices Oil price decomposition Source: Bloomberg, Haver Analytics, IEA and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: The decomposition is derived from a monthly structural BVAR model with sign restrictions.", "The model decomposes the average Brent spot oil price, global oil production and global economic activity and identifies three shocks: i) aggregate demand shocks are identified by an increase in prices, production and activity; ii) precautionary demand shocks are identified by an increase in prices and production and a decrease in activity; iii) supply shocks are identified by an increase in prices and a decrease in production and activity.", "Another way to see this is to consider the strong surge in oil inventories among OECD countries.", "Overhang in oil inventories weighing on oil prices OECD oil inventories and oil price (lhs: billion barrels, rhs: USD per barrel, inverted) Sources: Bloomberg, IEA and ECB staff calculations.", "Oil inventories typically correlate closely, and negatively, with oil prices.", "One of the key factors behind the rise in inventories was the initial decision by traditional oil-producing economies to abandon production targets, and hence to put downward pressure on oil prices, in response to the unprecedented surge in shale oil production in the United States that took off at the beginning of the past decade.", "Over this period, the United States has emerged as the largest oil producer in the world, and it now accounts for nearly one-fifth of total global oil output.", "Shale oil break-even prices may anchor oil price expectations Market share of major oil producers Sources: IEA and ECB staff calculations.", "Latest observation: January 2020.", "There are signs that the rise of the United States as a major oil producer may have fundamentally changed market expectations of the long-run equilibrium price of oil.", "Over recent years, we have observed an interesting correlation between future expected oil prices and the evolution of the break-even price of shale oil producers, i.e.", "the price above which it becomes profitable to exploit new sources of shale oil.", "All else being equal, market participants expect oil prices to converge towards the expected marginal cost of supply.", "Shale oil break-even prices may anchor oil price expectations Oil production break-evens and long-term oil price expectations (USD per barrel) Sources: Dallas Fed, Kansas Fed and Bloomberg.", "Notes: Dallas Fed data is yearly, Kansas Fed data is bi-yearly.", "Latest observation: January 2020.", "At face value, this anchoring role of the break-even price could suggest that investors consider the shale oil revolution to have structurally changed the elasticity of oil supply to demand fluctuations, and hence to have put an effective ceiling on oil prices.", "Whether or not the oil supply has indeed become more elastic, and may therefore permanently reduce the upside contribution of energy to headline inflation, is, ultimately, an empirical question.", "But more fundamentally, changes in the oil market have been accompanied by equally far-reaching changes in the use of oil as a production input.", "Over the past few decades, technological advances and shifts in the energy and industry composition in advanced economies have gradually reduced the sensitivity of growth and, hence, underlying inflation, to oil price increases.", "For example, between 1990 and 2018, global oil intensity - total oil consumption per unit of gross domestic product - fell by 25%.", "Global economy more resilient to oil price shocks Sources: IEA, Haver Analytics and ECB staff calculations.", "Latest observation: 2018.", "ECB staff analysis suggests that, as a result, a supply-induced increase in oil prices today causes global industrial production to contract by only around half as much as it did during the 1990s and 2000s.", "Global economy more resilient to oil price shocks Response of global industrial production to oil supply shocks (impulse responses to shock after 48 months; median and 15th and 85th percentiles, percentage points) Sources: IEA, FRED and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: The response is estimated using a SVAR with sign restrictions.", "The oil supply shock is identified assuming that it lowers oil production and industrial production but raises the price of oil.", "The responses are calibrated to a 10 percent shock to the price of oil.", "The muted response of financial markets to the tensions in the Middle East around the turn of the year would be consistent with these findings.", "These trends could even intensify in the future in the course of the ongoing energy transition.", "In the European Union, for example, the objective is to further reduce energy consumption by one-third by 2030, and to increase the use of renewable energy sources.", "If successful, this would further mitigate the pass-through of potential oil price fluctuations to production and, hence, underlying inflation.", "Moreover, if more fundamental progress is achieved in terms of energy storage, the marginal cost of producing renewable energy may become considerably lower and more stable compared with the production of fossil fuels.", "This could much more fundamentally transform the role of energy in affecting overall price dynamics.", "Taken together, persistent supply shocks of this nature potentially pose a dilemma for monetary policy in the sense that improved energy efficiency and more stable oil prices have supported, and continue to support, consumption and investment, but risk entrenching expectations of low inflation.", "In this case, central banks may no longer be able to afford to \"look through\" such shocks, and may be forced to shorten the horizon over which inflation should be brought back to their aim.", "This trade-off is even more problematic in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, for at least two reasons.", "The first, and most obvious, is because policy space is reduced.", "The second is that a more intense usage of non-standard policy measures, such as negative interest rates or asset purchases, may shift the balance of the costs and benefits of providing an additional unit of monetary accommodation.", "The implication of this is that, today more than ever, central banks need to have a solid understanding of how inflation expectations ultimately affect the inflation outlook and which expectations are at play.", "This question is an integral part of the ECB's ongoing strategy review.", "If, for example, market-based inflation expectations prove to have only a marginal effect on actual inflation, then the case for central banks acting on these measures is weakened substantially, even if they signal rising discomfort about future inflationary pressures.", "The role of profits in the transmission of monetary policy The second structural factor that I would like to discuss today relates to the role of profit margins in affecting inflation outcomes and the transmission of monetary policy.", "It is well-known that many firms routinely absorb short-term fluctuations in demand, exchange rates or production costs in their profit margins.", "In the euro area, for example, there is substantial variation in profit margins over time.", "Variations in profit margins affect inflation dynamics GDP deflator and components (annual percentage changes, pp contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.", "A model-based assessment by ECB staff shows that demand shocks - both domestic and foreign - and

mimeo.", "Notes: Historical decomposition of unit profit growth from a BVAR model in which domestic and foreign demand shocks, wage-mark up shocks and oil supply shocks are identified via sign restrictions.", "An issue that is less well understood, however, is whether this buffering role of profit margins has changed over time - that is, whether structural changes in the profitability of firms have increased or reduced the role of profits in affecting aggregate price dynamics.", "My starting point for answering this question is the evolution of the profit share over time.", "You can see that the profit share has increased substantially, both in the euro area and the United States.", "Structural rise in profit share and number of highly profitable firms Profit shares in the euro

operating surplus plus compensation of employees.", "Gross operating surplus is corrected for the self-employed.", "In the euro area, it has increased from an average level of 25% in the 1970s to 37% today, and it has increased by even more than in the United States over this period.", "This rise has not been sudden.", "It has rather been a gradual and persistent increase that only came to a halt with the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008.", "Macroeconomic data are often only a very crude proxy of net entrepreneurial income.", "But microdata corroborate the view that aggregate profitability is likely to have increased structurally over time.", "Structural rise in profit share and number of highly profitable firms Profitability of firms in the euro area (percentage of firms)

economy output coverage of 5070% on average.", "The between country weighting is done using GDP weights.", "The share of euro area firms with very high profitability - here measured as firms displaying a ratio of profits over revenues of greater than 5% - has increased by around 10 percentage points, to 42%, since 1995.", "At the same time, the share of firms with very low profitability has declined.", "Two broad competing hypotheses have been proposed in the literature to explain the rise in profits, mainly for the case of the United States.", "One is that growing profits are the result of the rise of highly productive \"superstar firms\".", "The other hypothesis, which is less favourable, is that a gradual decline in competition and increased regulation has protected rent-seeking firms.", "A more detailed discussion of these hypotheses is beyond the scope of my remarks today.", "I will rather focus on what the rise in profits may imply for the pass-through of monetary policy to inflation.", "I see two broad repercussions.", "The first is rather mechanical but quantitatively important.", "Rising profits imply a lower labour share, so changes in labour costs have less direct impact on inflation than they did two or three decades ago.", "The second, and related, implication is that higher profit margins provide a larger cushion for firms to absorb cost-push shocks, such as wage increases.", "A staff analysis using the ECB's workhorse structural model, the New Area-Wide Model, supports the view that profit margins were, and are, being used to cushion emerging price pressures.", "Profit margins buffer upside shocks to inflation Decomposition of euro area HICP inflation based on the New Area-Wide Model II Notes: The chart presents the

- (green bars) have never played a larger and more persistent role in mitigating upward pressure on inflation than they do today.", "This does not mean that the pass-through of changes in demand and production costs to final consumer prices is generally impaired.", "Rather, it means that the lags with which they are transmitted may be longer and more variable.", "Recent ECB research has confirmed that there is a robust link between changes in labour costs and price inflation in the euro area.", "But it also highlights that this link is state and shock-dependant.", "In an environment of weak demand, for example, firms tend to absorb cost-push shocks by compressing their price mark-ups.", "The implication is that today, as compared with the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s, the structural rise in
