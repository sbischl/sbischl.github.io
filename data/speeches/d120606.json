nearly as much so as playing the Old Course on yesterday's bank holiday with Professor Andy Mackenzie, the university's great scratch golfer and noted physics professor.", "In a setting as august as this one - on the eve of the 600th anniversary of this great academy - and speaking on the day marking the 129th anniversary of the birth of John Maynard Keynes and the 289th anniversary of the baptism of Adam Smith in nearby Kirkcaldy -

the fed funds rate - to zero, the majority of the committee decided to expand the money supply by purchasing MBS, notes and bonds.", "When we buy something in the marketplace, we pay for it, and this has resulted in significant liquidity floating about the U.S. economy, much of it going unused.", "As mentioned earlier, $1.5 trillion of excess reserves from private banks is on deposit in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, where it earns a paltry 0.25 percent, rather than being lent to job-creating businesses at rates bankers would prefer.", "Additionally, some $2 trillion of excess cash is parked on corporate balance sheets - above and beyond the operating cash flow needs of the business sector - and copious amounts of cash are lying fallow in the pockets of nondepository financial institutions, such as private equity and other investment funds.", "A running discussion in the marketplace centers around whether the FOMC will decide to engage in further quantitative easing, especially given the most recent economic weakness in the U.S., against the backdrop of the well-known problems in Europe and slower growth in China and other \"emerging\" economies.", "I shall turn to that in a few moments.", "First, I want to go back to the 12 Federal Reserve Banks.", "Different growth patterns in the 12 Federal Reserve districts Here is a map of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank districts.", "The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the Fed's activity in the light green area -

Texas is the most prominent of those places - easy money is more likely to be put to work than in places where government policy retards job creation.", "During the next few weeks as I contemplate the future course of monetary policy, I will be asking myself what good would it do to buy more mortgage-backed securities or more Treasuries when we have so much money sitting on the sidelines and yet have no sense of direction for the future of the federal government's tax and spending policy.", "And with the president's health care legislation awaiting resolution in the Supreme Court, we also know that no business can budget its personnel costs until that case is decided.", "If job-creating businesses have no idea what their taxes will be, are clueless about how federal spending will impact their customers or their own businesses and cannot budget personnel costs -

of policymakers trembling with anguish at the daunting demands of their profession - would provide scant comfort to those who depend upon them to maintain their composure and skate ably across a cold and foreboding economic landscape, seeking to guide the economy to a better place.", "Central banks are just one vehicle for influencing overall macroeconomic behavior, in addition to influencing through regulation the microeconomic agents that transmit that influence to the markets -
