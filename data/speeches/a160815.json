this talk, which covers shorter-term developments.", "On a year-on-year basis, since 2014 Mexico's GDP has grown at an average rate of 2.3 percent, not far from the historical performance, with a dip

a slowdown in industrial production.", "Softening industrial output in Mexico seems to result from two shocks.", "One is falling oil extraction due to the near depletion of Pemex's most profitable oil

"Increased risk aversion has been a constant for currencies, bonds and other investments in the last couple of years, and investors appear to have latched onto the tactic of shorting the Mexican peso as an easy way to hedge their risks when other emerging-market assets face headwinds.", "Another factor, however, is Mexico's weakened fiscal position.", "The nation has seen a longstanding rising trend in overall public-sector debt over GDP.", "Additionally, Pemex net oil export revenues have dropped drastically.", "A stronger fiscal stance is necessary given a historic balance of

by unusually low noncore price increases, including soft international agricultural and domestic government-determined prices.", "On the other hand, core inflation has been rising gradually, reflecting the effect of peso depreciation on tradable goods prices.", "This is very clearly shown by the behavior of merchandise inflation.", "Additionally, an accelerating rise in the producer price index also reveals an impact from peso weakening.", "Medium-term inflation expectations, as measured by analysts' surveys, have remained relatively stable, albeit above the target.", "Market-derived expectations appear to show a recent spike.", "In this context, monetary policy has been preemptive, with interest rate hikes seeking to avert deviations of inflation expectations and to anchor them on the target, particularly in the face of significant peso depreciation.", "The resulting flattening of the yield curve seems to reflect confidence that inflation will continue to be contained.", "It is worth emphasizing that the Bank of Mexico does not target any level of the exchange rate.", "Its primary objective is maintaining low inflation, and Mexico adheres to a freely floating exchange-rate regime.", "This does not mean that movements in the exchange rate have no impact on inflation.", "In fact, as mentioned, moderate pass-through has occurred from the exchange rate to consumer prices, concentrated in durable goods.", "But this may change, and monetary policy should remain vigilant.", "Some risks to the consolidation of convergence of inflation to the 3 percent permanent target prevail.", "The most notable danger is more weakening of the peso with a generalized impact on prices, knocking inflation expectations off track.", "Also, rises in noncore prices

"Over the course of many years, Mexico and the United States have benefited from increased integration, both cultural and economic.", "Mexican economic activity, however, has recently decelerated and confronts downside risks, among them, the possibility that the U.S. industrial sector's performance will turn out to be softer than anticipated.", "Other dangers are weaker consumer and producer confidence, a steeper-than-expected fall in oil output, and possibly more volatile financial markets.", "The latter might squelch financing for the government and private firms.", "Greater risk aversion could become exacerbated by geopolitical events.", "In this context, Mexico's fiscal stance should be fortified, and its monetary policy must continue to employ complete flexibility in order to consolidate the convergence of inflation to the permanent target, thereby shielding the economy with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none",
