reflection of uncertainty over fiscal policies, high indebtedness, and low income growth.", "And we should be vigilant of the potential costs of cheap money.", "As market stresses subside and money multipliers recover, the abundance of liquidity could fuel a strong monetary expansion with adverse consequences for prices, which would eventually require large hikes in interest rates to counter.",

policy, central banks must look forward now and prepare a strategy for a smooth transition back to normalcy.", "Asian economies: dealing with desynchronised global macroeconomic cycles 31.", "The

and Emerging Asia staging a vigorous rebound.", "Incipient inflationary pressures prompted central banks in the region to raise policy rates from mid-2010 onwards.", "Although renewed risks stemming from the Eurozone crisis led to a fresh round of easing in some economies in late-2011, policy rates in Emerging Asia are on average 75 basis points higher now vis-a\u0300-vis their troughs during the

recalibrate their monetary and fiscal policies, as external demand conditions and domestic cost pressures pull in opposite directions.", "Maintaining flexibility in macroeconomic policies must go hand-in-hand with reforms to strengthen domestic demand.", "Breaking new ground in macroprudential policies 36.", "The de-synchronisation of global macroeconomic cycles between the advanced economies and emerging market economies poses more challenges for the latter than the former.", "As long as monetary conditions in the advanced economies remain easy, emerging market economies face the risk of misallocated resources and disruptive capital flows, which in turn can affect both price stability and financial stability.", "Low interest rates and abundant liquidity have contributed to asset price accelerations in some Asian countries, especially in real estate markets.", "Residential property prices in Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, for example, have increased by 35% on average since 2009, while nominal wages have risen by only 13%.", "No doubt, increased capital flows to emerging market economies reflect the superior growth prospects of these economies.", "There is a structural rebalancing of global investment portfolios towards emerging markets in general, and Emerging Asia in particular.", "A multi-pronged policy response is needed to ensure that inflationary pressures remain contained in the face of this \"wall of money\" - including a gradual appreciation of nominal effective exchange rates.", "And indeed, since mid-2009, when capital flows began to return to Emerging Asia, most regional currencies have appreciated by 3-10% in nominal effective terms.", "But exchange rates alone cannot shoulder the burden of adjustment to low global interest rates and large capital inflows.", "In fact, strong and sustained exchange rate appreciation may well attract even more capital inflows.", "And excessively rapid currency appreciation runs the risk of sharply curtailing exports and dragging down the economy.", "Nor is it clear that exchange rate appreciation alone could have mitigated the increased demand for credit and consequent surge in property prices that we have seen in Emerging Asia.", "Likewise, interest rates are too blunt a tool to deal with sector-specific excesses, such as in real estate.", "An interest rate policy that is sufficiently aggressive to affect credit conditions and asset prices is likely to impose quite a high cost on the rest of the economy.", "Asian policymakers have therefore been experimenting with a variety of so-called macroprudential policies, to rein in asset price inflation and avoid a build-up of imbalances amidst a low interest rate environment.", "Macroprudential measures as practised in Asia fall into two broad categories: One, prudential measures to restrain credit extended to the property market.", "These include loan-to-value ratios, debt service ratios, and caps on property lending.", "Two, fiscal measures to discourage property transactions of a speculative nature.", "These include transaction taxes, such as stamp duties and capital gains taxes.", "With multiple policy objectives and a challenging economic environment, macroprudential tools have given additional degrees of freedom to Asian policymakers who want to avoid a build-up of financial imbalances and unsustainable asset prices, but do not want to give up domestic monetary sovereignty, allow excessive exchange rate appreciation, or impose capital controls.", "While these targeted interventions have achieved a measure of success, macroprudential policies in Emerging Asia have been deployed in a relatively eclectic and even ad-hoc manner.", "As these countries return to more normal times, there is a need to formalise and institutionalise the modus operandi of these policies, for greater transparency and policy effectiveness.", "Reforms to strengthen the underlying potential of economies 44.", "Let me now turn to the last, and perhaps most important, set of policies that will determine how successfully the global economy secures a return to normalcy.", "These are the structural reforms needed to strengthen the underlying potential of economies.", "Let me highlight those which I think are most important.", "Advanced economies: labour reform, tax reform, pension reform 45.", "In the advanced economies, I would put labour market reform, tax reform, and pension reform at the top of the list.", "Labour markets need to become more flexible, especially in Europe.", "Even in the US, production patterns are changing rapidly, increasing skills mismatches and generating structural unemployment.", "Labour market policies must seek to facilitate the shift of workers from domestically-oriented sectors facing weak demand to export-oriented sectors, and from depressed regions to resurgent ones.", "And wages must become more flexible, so that firms can ride out cyclical downturns without losing competitiveness.", "The debate needs to shift from the rate of taxation to the structure of the tax system.", "The US could do with a broader tax base, simpler tax codes, and less exemptions.", "In Europe, similarly, there are opportunities to increase the efficiency of the VAT system including in broadening its base.", "Government spending in many advanced economies needs to be overhauled in the face of impending demographic challenges.", "Effective pension reform requires a judicious combination of increases in the statutory retirement age and reductions in the generosity of benefits, with the balance varying from country to country.", "Emerging Asia: domestic demand, financial deepening, productivity 49.", "In Emerging Asia, the key structural reforms are in the areas of boosting domestic demand, deepening financial markets, and raising efficiency and productivity.", "Boosting domestic demand is perhaps the most important medium-term imperative for Emerging Asia.", "Public and private sector deleveraging in the advanced economies has at least dented, if not extinguished, the export-powered growth model that has been largely responsible for the \"Asian Miracle\".", "Reforms are needed to stimulate private consumption in some Asian economies, and investment in others.", "In China, the issue is consumption, not investment.", "China needs to lift its consumption ratio from its current low of 36%.", "Ongoing efforts to bolster the social safety net, enhance consumer protection, reform tax systems, and liberalise interest rates, are steps in the right direction.", "In India and the ASEAN economies, the challenge is to increase investment spending, especially in infrastructure.", "This will not only generate indigenous demand, but also alleviate supply-side constraints that have become increasingly evident in recent years.", "Second, Asia must deepen and broaden its financial markets.", "Asia needs to do a better job in efficiently intermediating its large savings pool, as well as directing capital inflows towards more productive investment in the region.", "Asian financial systems are still too dependent on banks.", "Deep corporate bond markets can play a complementary role in enabling private and institutional investors to invest for the long term.", "Countries in Emerging Asia are still far from the technological frontier, and there is ample room for gains in productivity.", "However, unlocking these gains will require different policies across the region.", "China can unleash higher productivity by removing inefficiencies and distortions in its economy.", "The prescriptions are well-known - overhaul state-owned enterprises, liberalise the financial sector, instil cost of capital discipline.", "But delivering them will take determination and political will.", "In India and the ASEAN countries, improvements in governance and regulation will be key to attracting investments that can raise supply capacity and productivity.", "The world has coped relatively well with the numerous shockwaves that have rocked the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis.", "Now that we are advancing on the road to recovery, policy-makers must lay the ground for a return to normalcy.", "We would do well to recall the words of Winston Churchill, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts\".", "Thank you, and I wish you a successful conference."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
