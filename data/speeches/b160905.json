there is no additional money printing or reserve creation involved.", "But when we pay a special dividend to the government, we have to create additional permanent reserves, or more colloquially, print money.", "Every year, we have in mind a growth rate of permanent reserves consistent with the economy's cash needs and our inflation goals.", "Given that budgeted growth rate, to accommodate the special dividend we will have to withdraw an equivalent amount of money from the public by selling government bonds in our portfolio (or alternatively, doing fewer open market purchases than we budgeted).", "Of course, the Government can use the special dividend to spend, reducing its public borrowing by that amount.", "But the RBI will have to sell bonds of exactly that amount to the public in order to stick to its target for money creation.", "The overall net sale of Government bonds by the Government and the RBI combined to the public (that is, the effective public sector borrowing requirement) will not change.", "But the entire objective of financing Government spending with a special RBI dividend is to reduce overall Government bond sales to the public.", "That objective is not achieved!", "The bottom line is that the RBI should transfer to the government the entire surplus, retaining just enough buffers that are consistent with good central bank risk management practice.", "Indeed, this year the Board paid out an extra 8,000 crores than was promised to the Government around budget time.", "Separately, the government can infuse capital into the banks.", "The two decisions need not be linked.", "There are no creative ways of extracting more money from the RBI - there is no free lunch!", "Instead, the Government should acknowledge its substantial equity position in the RBI and subtract it from its outstanding debt when it announces its net debt position.", "That would satisfy all concerned without monetary damage.", "If what I have said just now seems complicated, it is, but it is also the correct economic reasoning.", "Similar detailed rationales lead us to turn down demands to cut interest rates in the face of high inflation, to depreciate or appreciate the exchange rate depending on the whim of the moment, to use foreign exchange reserves to fund projects, to display forbearance in classifying bad loans or waived farmer loans as NPAs, and so on... We have been tasked with a job of maintaining macroeconomic stability, and often that task requires us to refuse seemingly obvious and attractive proposals.", "The reason why we have to do what we have to do may not be easy for every unspecialized person, even ones with substantial economics training, to grasp quickly.", "Of course, we still must explain to the best of our ability but we also need to create a structure where the public trusts the central bank to do the right thing.", "This then is why we need a trusted independent central bank.", "Central bank independence In this environment, where the central bank has to occasionally stand firm against the highest echelons of central and state government, recall the words of my predecessor, Dr. Subbarao, when he said \"I do hope the Finance Minister will one day say, 'I am often frustrated by the Reserve Bank, so frustrated that I want to go for a walk, even if I have to walk alone.", "But thank God, the Reserve Bank exists.'\"", "I would go a little further.", "The Reserve Bank cannot just exist, its ability to say \"No!\"", "At the same time, the central bank cannot become free of all constraints, it has to work under a framework set by the Government.", "This requires a number of actions.", "Outline responsibilities of the RBI When the responsibilities of the RBI are fuzzy, its actions can continuously be questioned.", "Instead, if the constitutional authorities outline a framework for the responsibilities of the RBI, it can take actions consistent with those responsibilities and be held to outcomes.", "The inflation objectives recently set for the RBI by the Government are an example of what is needed.", "Critics can lambast the RBI if it fails continuously to meet the objectives, but if they want it to lower interest rates even when the RBI barely meets its objectives, they should instead petition the Government to change the objectives.", "Similarly, the RBI Board has adopted a risk management framework which indicates the level of equity the RBI needs, given the risks it faces.", "The dividend policy of the RBI then becomes a technical matter of how much residual surplus is available each year after bolstering equity.", "Frameworks thus reduce the space for differences.", "The RBI's role in macroeconomic stability is, however, still fuzzy.", "While RBI clearly has responsibility for the safety and soundness of credit institutions and the stability of the external account, there are some areas that are hazier.", "For example, with an inflation focused framework, the RBI's ability to be accommodative depends on fiscal prudence from the center and states.", "How much should the RBI warn on fiscal profligacy, including the building up of contingent liabilities, and when should such warning be seen as interfering in the legitimate decisions of the elected representatives of the people?", "This is an area where clarity would be useful.", "Strengthen oversight The freedom the RBI has to take operational decisions such as the FCNR (B) swap arrangement, albeit invariably in consultation with the Finance Ministry, is important.", "However, there are always government entities that are seeking oversight over various aspects of the RBI's activities.", "Multiple layers of scrutiny, especially by entities that do not have the technical understanding, will only hamper decision making.", "Instead, the government-appointed RBI Board, which includes ex-officio government officials as well as government appointees, should continue to play its key oversight role.", "In this regard, all important RBI decisions including budgets, licenses, regulation, and supervision are now either approved by the Board or one of its sub-committees.", "Vacancies in the RBI Board, which have remained unfilled for many months now, should be filled quickly so that the full expertise and oversight of the Board can be utilized.", "It is also important that Parliament understand what the central bank is doing.", "The Governor and Deputy Governors interact regularly with various parliamentary committees, but we have also initiated a six-monthly interaction with the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, where the Governor reports on the activities of the Bank, and the Committee offers its views and concerns.", "Rank of RBI Governor There is a reason why Central Bank Governors sit at the table along with the Finance Ministers in G-20 meetings.", "It is that the Central Bank Governor, unlike other regulators or government secretaries, has command over significant policy levers and has to occasionally disagree with the most powerful people in the country.", "It is dangerous to have a de facto powerful position with low de jure status.", "Today, the RBI Governor has the salary of the Cabinet Secretary.", "He or she is appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Finance Minister.", "The Governor's rank in the government hierarchy is not defined but it is generally agreed that decisions will only be explained only to the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister.", "There is an informal understanding in India that the Governor has the room to make needed decisions.", "In the interests of macroeconomic stability, none of this should be changed, though if these issues are ever revisited, there may be some virtue in explicitly setting the Governor's rank commensurate with her position as the most important technocrat in charge of economic policy in the country.", "I do not fool myself into thinking that reporters and TV cameras follow me around everywhere because I am a magnetic speaker.", "They follow RBI Governors around because they may offer market-moving information on policy.", "Fortunately, I have escaped unintentionally saying anything that moves markets.", "At the same time, while different RBI Governors have different approaches to communication, no one can dispense with it.", "Unlike a developed country, where the Central Bank Chairman can offer periodic Delphic pronouncements about the course of monetary policy, and occasionally remonstrate with Parliament or the government about the course of fiscal policy, in our developing democracy the RBI Governor has to continuously make the case for the actions the central bank is taking, including the many structural reforms that are underway.", "Indeed, communication is as much about educating as it is about informing.", "For instance, even as I explained to entrepreneurs and retail borrowers why interest rates were not falling faster, I had to use the price of dosas to explain to pensioners why they were actually better off earning lower nominal but higher real interest rates.", "Public understanding can help ease the way for reforms, as well as increase support for policies.", "The RBI Governor therefore has to explain again and again.", "Occasionally, of course, the Governor has to warn about the dangers of certain courses of action or certain tendencies in the economy for growth and macroeconomic stability.", "Finally, the Governor is also a role model for the youth in this country, and should therefore not duck the responsibility to urge them to follow the highest standards of citizenship when he or she is invited to speak directly to them.", "My parents could give me a wonderful childhood and a great education in this country.", "We all grow up with such debts, and public service is a way to partially repay them.", "However, the last few years, working with dedicated colleagues at the RBI and the Finance Ministry, have been so fulfilling that I think I have received rather than given.", "I believe we have undertaken important reforms in payments, in banking, in the conduct of monetary policy and liquidity management, in financial markets, and in the resolution of distress, as well as within the RBI itself.", "Only time will tell whether they will have lasting impact, but I tried to do the best job I could, without fear or favor.", "This is the last public speech I will give in India for a while - my successor has to take over the RBI's communication and I want to get out of his way.",
