for example, instead of settling the 1,000 CETES that were intended in a transaction, only 990 would be settled - a practice unheard at the time.", "We broke the mold when we realized that it was feasible to offer participants a simple choice: to operate on the basis of an efficient multilateral netting scheme that would partially settle some operations, or to operate on a gross basis.", "The intermediaries went for the most efficient solution.", "And so, thanks to the use of operations research techniques, a new methodology to settle securities in the Mexican market was born.", "With this solution in hand, Banco de Me\u0301xico felt Indeval had the capability to develop a system that would: 1.", "Settle under a delivery versus payment scheme.", "That is, having an unbreakable link between the settlement of a securities transfer and the corresponding payment.", "Participants would be able to know, almost in real time, which transactions were settled.", "Make efficient use of the liquidity available for settlement, both in terms of securities and money.", "We knew from the models developed by Banco de Me\u0301xico that it was possible to implement a system with such characteristics and, more importantly, that this would yield a first class securities settlement system.", "After intensive analysis, testing and calibration, and with the valuable assistance of the Instituto Tecnolo\u0301gico Auto\u0301nomo de Me\u0301xico (ITAM), Indeval decided to use the model proposed by Banco de Me\u0301xico for its new, ground breaking system, DALI\u0301.", "Today, we are very fortunate to have the first securities settlement system that offers multilateral netting and near real time settlement, with significant advantages for our financial market.", "We now have an outstanding securities settlement system that offers excellent services to investors, issuers and intermediaries, and generates trust in our financial system.", "We believe that the effort we all put into the design, development, and testing of DALI\u0301 was well spent.", "I congratulate Indeval, and the staff from ITAM and Banco de Me\u0301xico who participated in this project.", "Thank you very much for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Securities settlement system", "Real time settlement", "Multilateral netting", "Payment systems", "Liquidity provision", "Operations research techniques", "Mathematical models", "Linear programming", "Network flow problems", "Delivery versus payment"]}
