{"sentences": ["Today I would like to share with you some of the evolving international financial issues that have so engaged us at the Federal Reserve over the past year.", "I, particularly, have been focusing on innovations in the management of risk and some of the implications of those innovations for our global economic and financial system.", "Fostered by a lowering of trade barriers, cross-border exchange of goods and services over the past half century has increased far faster than world gross domestic product.", "But what is even more remarkable is how large the scale of cross-border finance has become, relative to the value of the trade that it finances.", "To be sure, much global finance reflects growing investment portfolios, some doubtless with a speculative component.", "But, at bottom, such finance is a central element of the systems that support the efficient international movement of goods and services.", "We strongly suspect, though we do not know for sure, that the accelerating expansion of global finance may be indispensable to the continued rapid growth of world trade in goods and services.", "It appears increasingly evident that many forms and layers of financial intermediation will be required if we are to capture the full benefit of our advances in technology and trade.", "Indeed, the seemingly outsized implicit compensation for risk associated with many investments worldwide suggests the potential for a far larger world financial system than currently exists.", "Among most of the large world trading economies the bias against investment in foreign assets is apparent in the still-high correlation between domestic savings and domestic investment.", "In decades past, risk was perceived to increase with distance.", "A paucity of information and surplus of regulation discouraged the cross-border movement of funds.", "Even today, with regulatory bars lowered and information and access much enhanced, bias against cross-border investment remains high.", "However, the continuous probing for enhanced returns, unless inhibited by governments, seems poised to create a much larger global presence of financial linkages in all our economies.", "As in all aspects of life, expansion of one's activities beyond previously explored territory involves taking risks.", "And risk by its nature has carried, and always will carry with it, the possibility of adverse outcomes.", "Accordingly, for globalization to continue to foster expanding living standards, risk must be managed ever more effectively as the century unfolds.", "The development of our paradigms for containing risk has emphasized dispersion of risk to those willing, and presumably able, to bear it.", "If risk is properly dispersed, shocks to the overall economic system will be better absorbed and less likely to create cascading failures that could threaten financial stability.", "The broad success of that paradigm seemed to be most evident in the United States over the past two and one-half years.", "Despite the draining impact of a loss of $8 trillion of stock market wealth, a sharp contraction in capital investment and, of course, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, our economy is still growing.", "Importantly, despite significant losses, no major U.S. financial institution has been driven to default.", "Similar observations pertain to much of the rest of the world but to a somewhat lesser extent than to the United States.", "These episodes suggest a marked increase over the past two or three decades in the ability of modern economies to absorb unanticipated shocks.", "To be sure, the recent weakened pace of world economic activity has raised concerns that the full cycle of the past decade has yet to be definitively concluded.", "But the already clearly evident increased resiliency arguably supports the view that the world economy already has become more flexible irrespective of how events unfold in the weeks and months ahead.", "This favorable turn of events has doubtless been materially assisted by the recent financial innovations that have afforded lenders the opportunity to become considerably more diversified and borrowers to become far less dependent on specific institutions or markets for funds.", "The wide-ranging development of markets in securitized bank loans, credit card receivables, and commercial and residential mortgages has been a major contributor to the dispersion of risk in recent decades both domestically and internationally.", "These markets have tailored the risks associated with such assets to the preferences of a broader spectrum of investors.", "Especially important in the United States have been the flexibility and the size of the secondary mortgage market.", "Since early 2000, this market has facilitated the large debt-financed extraction of home equity that, in turn, has been so critical in supporting consumer outlays in the United States throughout the recent period of cyclical stress.", "This market's flexibility has been particularly enhanced by extensive use of interest rate swaps and options to hedge maturity mismatches and prepayment risk.", "Financial derivatives, more generally, have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past fifteen years.", "Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades.", "Moreover, the counterparty credit risk associated with the use of derivative instruments has been mitigated by legally enforceable netting and through the growing use of collateral agreements.", "These increasingly complex financial instruments have especially contributed, particularly over the past couple of stressful years, to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and resilient financial system than existed just a quarter-century ago.", "Greater resilience has been evident in many segments of the financial markets.", "One prominent example is the response of financial markets to a burgeoning and then deflating telecommunications sector.", "Worldwide borrowing by telecommunications firms in all currencies amounted to more than the equivalent of one trillion U.S. dollars during the years 1998 to 2001.", "The financing of the massive expansion of fiber-optic networks and heavy investments in third-generation mobile-phone licenses by European firms strained debt markets.", "At the time, the financing of these investments was widely seen as prudent because the telecommunication borrowers had very high valuations in equity markets, which could facilitate a stock issuance, if needed, to take down bank loans and other debt.", "In the event, of course, prices of telecommunication stocks collapsed, and many firms went bankrupt.", "In decades past, such a sequence would have been a recipe for creating severe distress in the wider financial system.", "However, compared with decades past, banks now have significantly more capital with which to absorb shocks, and they employ improved systems for managing credit risk.", "In conjunction with this improvement, both as cause and effect, banks have more tools at their disposal with which to transfer credit risk and, in so doing, to disperse credit risk more broadly through the financial system.", "Some of these tools, such as loan syndications, loan sales, and pooled asset securitizations, are relatively straightforward and transparent.", "More recently, instruments that are more complex and less transparent--such as credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and credit-linked notes-have been developed and their use has grown very rapidly in recent years.", "Improved credit-risk management together with more and better risk-management tools appear to have significantly reduced loan concentrations in telecommunications and, indeed, other areas and the associated stress on banks and other financial institutions.", "More generally, such instruments appear to have effectively spread losses from defaults by Enron, Global Crossing, Railtrack, WorldCom, Swissair, and sovereign Argentinian credits over the past year to a wider set of banks than might previously have been the case in the past, and from banks, which have largely short-term leverage, to insurance firms, pension funds, or others with diffuse long-term liabilities or no liabilities at all.", "Many sellers of risk protection, as one might presume, have experienced large losses, but because of significant capital, they were able to avoid the widespread defaults of earlier periods of stress.", "It is noteworthy that payouts in the still relatively small but rapidly growing market in credit derivatives have been proceeding smoothly for the most part.", "Obviously, this market is still too new to have been tested in a widespread down-cycle for credit, but, to date, it appears to have functioned well.", "The market for credit derivatives has grown in prominence not only because of its ability to disperse risk but also because of the information it contributes to enhanced risk management by banks and other financial intermediaries.", "Credit default swaps, for example, are priced to reflect the probability of the net loss from the default of an ever-broadening array of borrowers, both financial and nonfinancial.", "As the market for credit default swaps expands and deepens, the collective knowledge held by market participants is exactly reflected in the prices of these derivative instruments.", "They offer significant supplementary information about credit risk to a bank's loan officer, for example, who heretofore had to rely mainly on in-house credit analysis.", "To be sure, loan officers have always looked to the market prices of the stocks and bonds of a potential borrower for guidance, but none directly answered the key question for any prospective loan: What is the probable net loss in a given time frame?", "Credit default swaps, of course, do just that and presumably in the process embody all relevant market prices of the financial instruments issued by potential borrowers.", "Price trends of default swaps have been particularly sensitive to concerns about corporate governance in recent months.", "The perceived risk of default of both financial and nonfinancial firms has risen markedly in the wake of company-threatening scandals, though levels remain moderate for most."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
