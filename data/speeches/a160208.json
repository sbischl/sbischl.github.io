strength of the international economy, movements in oil and other commodity prices, and the exchange rate can develop in unexpected ways.", "For example, at the current juncture, the economy is faced with a number of unique supply-side developments which add additional uncertainty to the outlook.", "These include reconstruction activity in Canterbury, the recent sharp fall in oil prices, a rapid rise in inward migration and the potential impacts of El-Nino.", "In addition to these business cycle developments, structural aspects that may be linked to factors such as globalisation, technology and demography can also have major impacts on economic growth and inflation.", "In normal times these structural aspects move relatively slowly.", "However they are important in determining how interest rates might affect inflation and the cycle in output and can move sharply in a crisis.", "All of these factors can affect the neutral interest rate, potential output and inflation

indication of how the Bank interpreted new economic events and the subsequent monetary policy response.", "Generally, market participants change their outlook for interest rates in a similar way to the Bank as new economic and financial information becomes available.", "The majority of the move in interest rates occurs before we have provided financial market participants with our interpretation of new events.", "This suggests market participants have a good understanding about how new information changes the Bank's own outlook, the conditionality of the Bank's projections and the Bank's reaction function.", "Conditional commitment in action - changes in the policy outlook since 2014 The changes in the Bank's policy stance since the beginning of 2014 provide a good illustration of the conditional nature of forward guidance in practice.", "However, a number of factors led to a moderation in the outlook for inflationary pressure over the quarters that followed.", "Both cyclical and structural aspects of the New Zealand economy evolved in unforeseen ways.", "These events included significant falls in the prices of oil and New Zealand's commodity exports, a stronger-than-expected exchange rate, weaker-thanexpected capacity pressures (and stronger potential growth), and weaker non-tradables inflation.", "Despite these developments, by the December 2015 Statement the Bank was projecting even stronger economic growth than had been expected in March 2014 (figure 2).", "This is not because the fundamental outlook had improved, but because this new information led the Bank to change its outlook for monetary policy and provide more stimulus to the economy.", "Indeed, the December 2015 Statement projected that the 90-day interest rate would be 2.6 percent in Q3 2017, almost 300 basis points lower than was forecast in March 2014 (figure 3).", "Given the weaker starting point for inflation, stronger growth was needed to bring inflation back to target.", "However, as discussed, this projection for stronger growth is conditional on a set of certain assumptions, and the Bank may need to change its activity and policy outlook if new events were to unfold.", "The changes in the 90-day interest rate projection over this time illustrate how flexible inflation targeting operates in practice.", "The forecasts evolved to ensure that medium-term price stability would be maintained.", "Therefore, despite inflation being weaker than expected and the revision to the 90-day interest rate outlook, the credibility of the monetary policy framework has been maintained.", "Medium-term inflation expectations have fallen over the past six months, but are currently near the 2 percent target midpoint (figure 4).", "External forecasters also expect inflation to return to target over the medium term.", "Crucially, the Bank is - and perceived to be - committed to its inflation target, which helps anchor inflation expectations.", "When formulating monetary policy, the PTA directs the Bank to have a forward-looking focus, irrespective of past inflation outcomes.", "The projection, at any time, seeks to ensure that price stability can be achieved while avoiding unnecessary instability in output, interest rates and the exchange rate.", "The Bank will continue to adjust monetary policy as conditions evolve to ensure that price stability is achieved over the medium term.", "When it comes to communication, central banks use a diverse range of practices, and best practices differ from country to country.", "For New Zealand, we find it beneficial to publish a projection for the 90-day interest rate.", "It supports transparency, and its evolution over time contributes to market participants' understanding of how the Bank responds to unexpected economic events.", "The projections are conditional in nature, reflecting the many challenges faced in forecasting the New Zealand economy.", "It is important financial market participants understand that these forecasts are not a commitment to a certain path of policy.", "Indeed, financial market participants generally have a very good understanding of the conditional nature of our forecasts.",
