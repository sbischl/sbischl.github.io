position.", "In this regard, Bank Negara Malaysia has constantly strived to improve the payment system infrastructure in this country.", "Payment system efficiency has contributed towards making Malaysia a competitive and efficient economy.", "Cheque truncation Bank Negara's effort in improving the payment infrastructure has been continuous.", "A significant milestone was achieved in 2009 when the e-SPICK system, an image-based cheque-clearing system was introduced.", "This modernized cheque processing in Malaysia.", "In essence, e-SPICK is a cheque truncation system which converted paper-based processing to electronic processing of cheques.", "Physical cheques are no longer sent to the issuing bank and the cheque clearing center for processing.", "Instead, images of cheques are sent electronically.", "Cheques which previously took up to 8 business days to clear (or T+8) can now be cleared within 2 business days (or T+2).", "This was done at a time when the country's broadband penetration rate was low at 32% compared to 67% today.", "The move to transmit cheques electronically not only shortened the clearing times for cheques, but also contributed to a significant reduction in the banks' cheque processing cost from RM6 to about RM3 per cheque1 today.", "With the lower cheque processing cost, the cost savings for the banking industry is estimated at about RM600 million2 per year.", "Migration to chip payment cards Another notable achievement in the country's payment system infrastructure is in the migration from magnetic stripe payment cards to chip payment cards, where Malaysia was the first country in the Asia Pacific region to do so.", "With the completion of the industry-wide migration to secure chip-based payment cards in 2005, the fraudulent skimming or counterfeiting of payment cards was eradicated.", "Whilst the migration costs the banks about RM200 million, this industry move proved to be a beneficial one as the pay-back to the banks in terms of potential fraud avoidance was in 2 and a half years.", "The efficiency and business opportunities to build applications on the chips are enormous.", "With a safer payment card infrastructure, tourists have increased their spending via credit cards in Malaysia, from RM4.7 billion in 2006 to RM7.7 billion in 2012, recording an average annual growth of 9% per annum.",

planning ahead to continuously improve the country's payment infrastructure in search for greater efficiency gains and cost savings for the country to remain competitive.", "Migration to electronic payments and its benefits With the rapid technological advancements and increasing demands for more efficient payment services, migration to electronic payment systems and channels has become imperative.", "Research has suggested that a successful migration to electronic payments has the potential to drive further efficiency gains and cost savings of about 1% of GDP annually.", "But to realize these benefits, we require more enhancements in payment infrastructure and a change of behaviour from users of payment systems.", "Globally, cheque numbers are falling.", "Based on the World Payments Report 2013, cheque usage in the mature Asia Pacific countries3 has registered the biggest decline.", "In Australia, cheque usage had declined by 60% in the past decade and at the current rate of decline, it is expected to reach near zero by 2018.", "In some European countries, like Norway and Sweden, cheques barely exist.", "Even in the US, which is sometimes referred to as the

achieved in the electronic payment infrastructure and the increasing sophistication of the Malaysian economy.", "Malaysia's usage of cheques per capita is 6.9 compared to 0.2 in advanced countries4.",

household broadband penetration rate in Malaysia has increased significantly from 32% in 2009 when we introduced the electronic processing of cheques, to 67% as at end-Sept 2013.", "With the necessary infrastructure in place, it is timely that all Malaysians migrate to electronic payments in our quest to become a high income, high value-added economy by 2020.", "To nudge the systematic migration to electronic payments, Bank Negara Malaysia has set targets in its Financial Sector Blueprint to reduce the number of cheques processed per annum by half from 204 million in 2012 to 100 million by 2020.", "At the same time, there are also targets to increase the number of Point-of-Sale terminals from 9 in 2012 to 25 unit per 1,000 inhabitants and to increase electronic payment transactions per capita from 56 in 2012 to 200 by 2020.", "Only by migrating from cheques and cash to electronic payments, can the country anticipate to achieve further cost savings and efficiency gains.", "Although significant improvement has been made in the cheque processing infrastructure, cheque remains an expensive payment instrument to process at about RM3 per cheque.", "The total cost is even higher when we take into account the cost incurred by the payer and payee in delivering and depositing cheques.", "It is estimated that cheque processing cost Malaysia about RM768 million5 per year.", "This amount is huge and a sheer wastage.", "Correcting distortion between paper-based and electronic payments Despite the cost incurred in processing cheques, cheques have not been priced directly to reflect its costs except for the stamp duty of 15 sen per cheque.", "On the contrary, electronic payment services such as the Interbank GIRO (IBG) are priced above cost at about RM2 per transaction.", "Such price distortion does not incentivize the adoption of the more efficient electronic payments on a mass scale.", "In advanced countries such as Australia, Norway and Sweden, electronic payment services are priced lower than cheques consistent with their respective cost of production.", "The correct price signals that reflect the real cost of cheques and electronic payments had facilitated a broad shift from the use of cheques to the use of electronic payments.", "We need to correct this price distortion between cheques and electronic payment services, Bank Negara Malaysia has announced a new pricing strategy for payment services in March this year where the price of IBG and cheques are aligned closer to their cost of production.", "With effect from 2 May 2013, the transaction fee for IBG conducted via internet and mobile banking was reduced to 10 sen from RM2 previously.", "In addition, a cheque processing fee of 50 sen per cheque leaf will be imposed 11 months later on 1 April 2014.", "The 11-month grace period before the implementation of the cheque processing fee is intended to afford both the public and the businesses ample time to familiarize with, adjust and migrate to using electronic payments such as the IBG for their payment transactions.", "Improving accessibility, security and convenience of electronic payments Based on a recent survey conducted on businesses, we have identified 4 key hindrances to the adoption of electronic payments, namely: Concern of the security of electronic payments \u2022 Difficulty to perform payment reconciliation Low limit of electronic payment transaction Lack of familiarity with electronic payments In terms of security measures, banks have continued to invest significantly to ensure the safety of electronic payment

expected to increase to its optimum level6.", "In addition, Bank Negara Malaysia has also called on the banks to widen the access points for the public to conduct electronic payments, including via the ATM network.", "While Malaysia's population stands at 29.7 million, there are 41 million ATM cards which have a debit application that can be used to make purchases at merchant outlets.", "This provides an opportunity for banks and businesses to leverage on, to improve the coverage of Point-of-Sale Terminals to facilitate the use of the debit card as means to reduce the need for cash, as well as, to increase tourist spending at more merchant outlets.", "With higher broadband and debit card penetration rate, coupled with increased payment innovation and strengthened security measures,
