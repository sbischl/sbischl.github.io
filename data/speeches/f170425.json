financial crisis of 2007-2008, the Greek economy has entered a deep and prolonged recession.", "The sovereign debt crisis in Greece turned soon into a banking crisis: banks were gradually excluded

brave programme of economic adjustment that has eliminated fiscal and external deficits and improved competitiveness that, between 2009 and 2016, resulted in the shrinkage of the general government deficit by approximately 14 percentage points of GDP and to the improvement of the primary balance, adjusted for the effect of the business cycle, by about 17 percentage points of potential GDP.", "This achievement represents one of the largest fiscal adjustments ever undertaken worldwide.", "Significant improvement was also recorded on external adjustment, where the current account improved by about 15 percentage points of GDP compared to 2008, being in balance in the last two years.", "In addition, bold reforms in the labour and product markets helped towards the restoration of

ECB has designed an NPL operational targets framework, supported by several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).", "The selected targets and KPIs are both actionoriented and results-oriented and provide

write-offs and to a lesser extent by liquidations, collections and sales of loans.", "The largest part of the reduction will be effective in 2018 and 2019, since inflows of new NPEs will remain significant in the second half of 2016 and 2017.", "Banks managed to achieve the NPE targets for Q3 and Q4 2016, despite the headwinds in real GDP growth in the last quarter.", "The State, for its

short-term debt relief measures for Greece on 23.1.2017.", "These measures, which were endorsed by the Eurogroup in December, are designed to reduce interest rate risk for Greece and to ease the country's repayment profile.", "Looking forward, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by around 2.5% in 2017, although a downward revision of the December 2016 forecasts is likely due to the negative carry-over effect of the sharp decline in output in Q4 2016 (attributed mainly to the decline in gross fixed capital formation and government consumption).", "Downside risks to the economic outlook exist related to delays in the conclusion of the second review of the Programme, the impact of increased taxation on economic activity and reform implementation.", "Downside risks connected
