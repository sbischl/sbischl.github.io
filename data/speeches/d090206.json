by example.", "Thus, his six-year term as head of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will be remembered for the world-class expertise and wisdom which he generously shared.", "It is fitting therefore that our awards tonight are given in honor of a great mentor - former BSP Governor Paeng Buenaventura.", "Ladies and gentlemen, let us celebrate the memory of Gov Paeng with a long round of applause.", "Teaching is a vocation; it requires intellectual, emotional, and spiritual commitment.", "It is therefore proper for us to reward outstanding educators.", "To me, the discipline,

"Given the hard and painful lessons from the ongoing global financial crisis, we cannot overemphasize the importance, the value of instilling good moral principles and good governance in the process

ever-expanding network of similar-minded individuals and institutions who will cooperate with us to reach out to broader segments of our society: from school children, students, young adults and professionals, overseas Filipinos, and members of the business sector, academe, media and public service.", "To those who wish to identify possible areas of cooperation with the Bangko Sentral, our initiatives include the launching of Economic and Financial Learning Centers in different regions; out-reach programs to teach financial management to overseas Filipinos and their families; in-house education activities to enhance economic education even among BSP staff; advocacy of microfinance as a tool for poverty alleviation for entrepreneurially-inclined but capital-challenged Filipinos; in
