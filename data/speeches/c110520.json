or in some cases even required by contract or mandate - to deliver a target rate of return.", "In many cases, these targets are now unrealistic and can be met only by taking on more risk than is prudent.", "Changes in accounting rules, which use low, risk-free interest rates to discount liabilities while valuing assets at current market prices, increase the pressure to achieve these high returns on a continuous basis.", "This is a particular instance of the \"search for yield\" that often accompanies a long period of very low interest rates.", "It may be associated with excessive credit creation and undue risktaking as investors seek higher returns, leading to the underpricing of risk and unsustainable increases in asset prices.", "A number of other developments - the record issuance of highyield debt securities in the United States, the rebound of capital flows into emerging-market economies and the popularity of commodity exchange-traded funds in recent quarters - are consistent with this pattern.", "The influence of sustained low interest rates in major advanced economies on risk-taking behaviour is a powerful dynamic that bears watching.", "Global imbalances are linked to the three risks I have just described and also pose some additional risks to the global financial system.", "The counterpart of these imbalances is that surplus countries in many cases are resisting upward pressure on their currencies and this is resulting in domestic inflationary pressures.", "As the authorities try to bottle up these inflationary pressures, that puts further stress on their financial systems.", "There is also the risk that the needed exchange rate adjustment, when it does come, will be disorderly.", "Resolving global imbalances requires that the United States and other deficit countries boost domestic savings in a timely and sustained manner.", "At the same time, surplus economies -
