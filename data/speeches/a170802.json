defence mechanisms available to central banks.", "Economic convention has often stressed on the impact of banks on the macro-economy as the 'financial accelerator' which creates financial cycles that may not be in sync with traditional business cycles.", "On the other hand, macroeconomic measures (e.g., interest rate policy) may create new avenues for financial fragility, including the so-called 'risk channel' of monetary policy.", "Central banks have given attention to the relationships between monetary policy and financial stability and have frontloaded this interface in designing monetary

Domestic Systemically Important Banks and macro-prudential measures in 2014.", "Not only do Basel III standards contain dampeners that stymie excessive risk-taking behaviour by banks, but it also

coalesce to cement the resilience of banks.", "The importance of addressing the systemic importance of banks in funding activities of groups to which they belong, had been flagged in the aftermath of the East Asian crisis of 1997.", "The socalled Korean 'Chaebols' or Japanese 'Keiretsus', generic terms to describe complex systems of conglomerates with interlocking contractual arrangements and shareholdings, were brought to the limelight in view of the profligacy displayed by some banks in lending to these groups in the absence of prudential regulation and supervision in these countries.", "More recently, in Mauritius, we witnessed an event that was reminiscent of the Chaebol-Keiretsu saga: the demise of the BAI group in April 2015, amid unbecoming practices by the group's flagship

banks.", "The stress testing framework is assisting the Bank of Mauritius to assess whether individual banks and the banking system as a whole is adequately capitalized to withstand shocks.", "Results from the Bank's stress testing model indicate that the Mauritian banking system as a whole is relatively robust to credit losses resulting from macroeconomic shocks.", "The Bank has also embarked on
