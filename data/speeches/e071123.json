(ii) drawing lessons and sharing experiences of central bank independence in developed, emerging and developing countries; (iii) appreciating the political, economic and legal aspects of operationalising greater independence for central banks; and (iv) exploring ways of enhancing fiscal and monetary coordination.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, the selection of papers to be presented and discussed at this Symposium will provide a platform for sharing ideas required for practical solutions aimed at improving the Bank's service delivery.", "As we tackle issues of inflation, exchange rates, and other key macroeconomic indicators, let us use this forum to outline some of the past developments and challenges that lie ahead of us as we aim to taking Zambia's financial sector to higher heights.", "Lastly, let me say that while we can all learn from what other central banks have done, each country should establish the legal framework for its central bank, and allow for its evolution, in ways which best fit that country's own history and institutions.", "I have no doubt that the symposium will be thought-provoking and highly participatory.", "May I wish all of you a good symposium and a memorable stay in Livingstone and Zambia in general."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Central bank independence", "Price stability", "Inflation", "Fiscal deficit", "Monetary policy", "Economic growth", "Financial stability", "Zambia", "SADC", "Fiscal and monetary coordination"]}
