and the need for stakeholders to adapt to the challenges ahead.", "Over the next two days, we will be discussing the interesting and important issue of how to create a viable, future-proof payment market for us and for our single currency - the euro.", "Having been born in 1999, the euro itself belongs to Generation Z, a group often characterised as digital natives.", "Unlike the rest of us, they didn't have to learn how to use technologies such as the internet and smartphones because they have never known anything different.", "Members of Generation Z often refer to themselves as innovative.", "Success in business now and in the future requires an understanding of the important role innovation plays for Generation Z and those that come after them.", "How does this translate into the world of payments?", "What are the expectations for innovative payments in Europe?", "What can we as a central bank do to facilitate payments innovation at a pan-European level?", "These are some of the questions that will be tackled at this conference.", "Our aim is to discuss and foster a joint understanding of the challenges ahead and the solutions to work towards.", "This is why we have brought together both our more established counterparts and new market actors from fintechs and start-up companies.", "Running in parallel to the conference -

which is both integrated and innovative - is fundamental to the creation of a more integrated, competitive and innovative Europe.", "And in a world of increasing digitalisation and globalisation, such an integrated and competitive payments market can only be achieved by exploiting the potential offered by ever more sophisticated innovative technology.", "Both established and new market actors should be able to benefit from the innovative space created.", "The Eurosystem has contributed substantially to an integrated European financial market by providing the market infrastructure which enables the safe and efficient flow of payments and financial instruments across Europe.", "But the work is by no means complete.", "The European financial market faces digitalisation challenges from both the regulatory and the technical side.", "Let me give a few examples.", "The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) was put in place to foster innovation and enhance competition in the retail payments market.", "Payment service providers have to accommodate enhanced security requirements and provide account access to third-party payment service providers.", "On the technical side, the introduction of instant payments means that internal systems and procedures need to be overhauled so that retail payments can move from batch processing into the real-time universe.", "The Eurosystem, too, has been looking for ways to make use of technical progress to improve the efficiency and lower the costs of its market infrastructure services -

or cards - as the basis for end-user solutions that appeal to customers.", "There is nothing wrong with that - as long as our regulatory requirements are respected and there is competition and diversity in the payments market.", "But will there be sufficient competition and diversity in the European payments market in the long run if we continue as we are doing now?", "What is the biggest challenge for payment service providers in Europe?", "Is it the harmonisation and integration measures introduced by central banks and regulators, or is it global competition?", "Might it not be more future-oriented to aim to deliver strong and resilient domestic European payment services in general and truly pan-European instant payment solutions in rather than defending national legacies or creating new regional or group-specific solutions?", "The Eurosystem wholeheartedly supports the creation of an innovative single payments market for the euro through its market infrastructure projects and policy work.", "We invite actors in the payment service industry to work with us on a future-oriented approach to pan-European innovative retail payment solutions.", "This will enable us to safeguard a competitive and diversified payments market -for the benefit not only of Generation Z, but of all individuals and businesses making euro payments across Europe.", "I wish you a fruitful discussion and an enjoyable conference."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Innovative payments", "Pan-European payments", "Payment services", "Instant payments", "Payment market", "Market infrastructure", "Digitalisation", "Competition", "Innovation", "SEPA"]}
