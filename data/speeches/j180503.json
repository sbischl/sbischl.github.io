Will it have come to a stop by the end of the year?", "I don't know yet, because the Governing Council of the ECB has not yet discussed it, let alone reached a decision.", "But the discussion is not just about asset purchases, it's also about the right combination of instruments that allows us to support economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2%.", "There are not just the asset purchases, there are also interest rates.", "And on this, we have been clear that interest rates will remain at their current levels, that is, very, very low, close to zero - even below zero - for a long period, even beyond the horizon of our asset purchases.", "So we need to look at the longer term.", "In the event of an economic slowdown - and, again, it is a possibility - do you have the means to respond effectively?", "It's not a possibility that we are currently talking about, because right now there is no reason to worry about growth in the euro area.", "Growth is very strong, very robust and very broad-based across the euro area.", "But whatever the circumstances, the ECB has a clear mandate: to bring inflation back towards 2%.", "We will do whatever needs to be done to bring inflation back towards 2%.", "But at the moment there is no need to adjust the path that has been decided on by the Governing Council.", "Inflation is currently at 1.4%...", "Is that a good level?", "It's not enough, it's disappointing.", "But we know the reasons: it's because unemployment is still high and there is a lot of economic slack in Europe.", "But we want to bring inflation back towards 2% in the medium term, and that is why monetary policy will remain accommodative.", "The major issue at present are the threats issued by the US President, Donald Trump, who blows hot and cold on trade policy, and in particular this power struggle he has embarked on with China.", "Should Europe get involved at this stage?", "As a large trading power, Europe is bound to be affected...
