uncertainty around the final outcome is already weighing on business and consumer sentiment.", "Within the Central Bank, we have been working on Brexit since before the referendum .", "The work has focused on a few main areas: First - Understanding the possible effects of Brexit, in terms of the risks to the Irish economy, to the financial system, and to consumers.", "Since the referendum in June 2016, the main impact thus far has been through the depreciation of sterling against the euro.", "However, the significant trade and investment links with the UK mean that the Irish economy is more exposed to the risks from the UK's departure than any others, apart from the UK.", "Second ensuring that existing Irish financial services firms understand and are planning for the impact that Brexit will have on their businesses, so that firms can continue to serve customers after the UK departs the EU.", "The third important area has been wider contingency planning for the system and

substantial contingency planning for Brexit.", "While regulatory elements all play a critical role, today I will focus on the macro-prudential tools at our disposal to build the resilience of the financial system, particularly for borrowers and lenders.", "Starting with lenders, a necessary part of promoting such resilience is the completion of the macroprudential framework for bank capital.", "I noted the small and open nature of the Irish economy.", "Whilst providing many positives, this openness increases the propensity - and sensitivity - of the Irish economy to global shocks.", "These can be structural shocks - like Brexit or changes in global trade or international taxation regimes.", "Or cyclical shocks - driven by the global economic cycle.", "It is important that banks hold sufficient buffers to guard against these higher levels of macroeconomic risks Ireland faces.", "To guard against cyclical risks, we have implemented a counter cyclical buffer.", "And set this at 1 per cent.", "The buffer aims to promote the sustainable provision of credit to the economy.", "It means banks have more capital when times are good, so they can use that to absorb losses in tougher times.", "Moving beyond the economic and financial cycle, we are also proactive in using our policies and tools to build resilience to structural risks and shocks.", "Following our request, we recently received confirmation from the Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform that a legislative provision will be introduced to complete our macroprudential toolkit for bank capital.", "This gives the Central Bank the power to introduce a systemic risk buffer (SyRB), which would help to counter structural shocks to the economy.", "This buffer aims to build the resilience of the banks to big shocks or tail risks, by requiring banks to have appropriate capital to absorb losses in case these risks were to crystallise .", "A central policy to build resilience of lenders and borrowers, is the mortgage measures we have had in place for a number of years.", "This is particularly important given the inherent volatility of the Irish economy.", "Neither the price level, nor the level of growth of house prices are the objective.", "Our measures are carefully calibrated to strengthen both bank and borrower resilience and to reduce the likelihood of a credit-house price spiral emerging.", "The mortgage measures are working as we designed them to.", "They are also flexible enough to take into account specific circumstances.", "A system of allowances for example is in place that allows banks to lend above the mortgage measure limits.", "To give an example, in 2018, one in eight loans to first time buyers were above the loan to income (LTI) limit of 3.5 .", "Further, almost 50 per cent of these allowances were for loans issued with an LTI ratio above 4.", "Looking at both first and subsequent borrowers last year, one fifth of the value of total mortgage lending was issued with an allowance to the loan to income (LTI) or to value (LTV) limits.", "The framework therefore is sufficiently flexible and the allowances enable banks to take individual borrower circumstances into account.", "We are all acutely aware of the current challenges in the Irish housing market and the supply constraints.", "These challenges clearly impact on young couples and families.", "Be they buying a new home or renting.", "But I have seen no evidence that more debt for these same young couples and families is the answer.", "We have a pool of buyers chasing a limited number of properties.", "And the legacy of nonperforming loans (NPLs) is a harsh reminder of what can happen when credit grows independent of incomes and fuels house prices.", "Our borrower-based measures aim to reduce the risks and hardship to households during a possible downturn or a house price shock and make them more resilient both now, and into the future.", "As usual, we will review the effectiveness of the measures in meeting their objectives during the Autumn.", "Be prepared, but prepared to act The variety of these macro-prudential tools provide flexibility that may be required in response to many shocks, domestic or global.", "Standing alone, a disorderly Brexit would argue for accommodative policies, for example allowing the automatic stabilisers to work and targeted fiscal measures for the most severely affected sectors.", "If any of the more global risks were to crystallise and have a significant effect on the domestic economy, they would likely pose different challenges.", "Whether it be dealing with the effects of storms blowing in from abroad, or having protection from the sun on those warm Irish summer days, the Central Bank stands ready to adjust the CCYB (buffer) in either direction as the risk environment evolves, in order to support a sustainable supply of credit to the economy.", "We can't control the weather.", "But we must ensure the system is resilient, and continues to function into the future, come rain, hail or shine.", "Finally, I hope you will allow me take the liberty of speaking at an event like MacGill to briefly look beyond the Central Bank tool kit.", "As policymakers, we serve the Irish public, the risks we face often overlap.", "And it is beneficial for all when our policy responses are in tune.", "While the domestic economy is doing well, we have the opportunity to boost our resilience to future shocks and risks.", "Prudent management of the public finances are needed.", "Interest payments on national debt are lower than expected and corporate tax receipts are high, but neither situation should be regarded as permanent .", "These funds should be put to work to buffer against the next downturn or crisis and not to finance current expenditure or to boost an economy which is close to capacity.", "A clear strategy guiding the use of unanticipated revenue inflows should be promptly established.", "Moreover, the reduction of public debt ought to remain a key priority given its very high level.", "To somewhat labour the analogy, we must 'fix the roof while the sun is shining'.", "Finally, as I said at the beginning, the global environment is uncertain, and with Brexit looming, we should be ready to respond if these risks materialise.", "But it is imperative that we are nimble and ready to cool the warming economy if these risks dissipate.", "We must not only be prepared, but prepared to act.", "Central Bank of Ireland: Brexit Task Force Reports.", "National Institute of
