invested abroad.", "The capital outflow through the Petroleum Fund contributes to both curbing the appreciation of the krone and maintaining its stability.", "Trade-weighted exchange rate Index.",

result in a weaker krone.", "In the past 12-18 months, developments in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries appear to have had a particularly marked impact on our currency.", "Norwegian interest rates have been pushed down to the level prevailing abroad.", "This partly reflected lowered market expectations concerning an interest rate increase abroad and expectations that interest rates might rise earlier in Norway than in other countries.", "At the same time, the euro appreciated in relation to other currencies.", "Changes in the krone resulted in an unintended tightening of monetary policy.", "This trend was reversed in December owing to a reduction in interest rates and low inflation figures.", "The interest rate reduction was probably of considerable importance as it eliminated the excess return on NOK investments.", "Today, the krone is at a level that is more consistent with the objective of promoting stability in output and employment.", "The weaker krone will contribute to a rise in inflation from a level that is too low.", "Normally, Norges Bank will not intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to influence the exchange rate.", "Exchange market intervention, whether it be purchases or sales of foreign exchange, is not an appropriate instrument for influencing the krone over a longer period.", "We do not wish to act in a way that may trigger a game situation in the foreign exchange market.", "Foreign exchange intervention rather than a change in the interest rate may give ambiguous signals to foreign exchange operators and a game situation may arise.", "Real krone exchange rate Deviation from average.", "When inflation has been higher in Norway than among our trading partners for a longer period,

perhaps most evident when the economy is sluggish.", "If the krone were to remain at a level that is too strong, nominal wages would have to remain unchanged over a longer period or fall in order to bolster companies and jobs.", "This only occurs when unemployment is very high.", "With a flexible exchange rate, a depreciation of the krone can also boost competitiveness.", "A flexible exchange rate can reduce fluctuations in employment and output.", "Empirical studies do not provide any evidence that floating exchange rates have reduced growth in industrial countries.", "Rather, they
