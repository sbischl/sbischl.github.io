principles: economic policy must contribute to stable economic developments and be sustainable over time.", "By linking petroleum revenue spending to the expected real return on the Fund - and not to current petroleum revenues - the fiscal rule provided for a gradual and sustainable phasingin of the revenues.", "If we can restrict spending to the return, the Fund will never shrink.", "Norway will also be less vulnerable to fluctuations in current petroleum revenues.", "(Chart 8: Effect on the size of GPFG of change in oil price and return) In the first ten years after the establishment of the

exceeding this will reflect the risk we are willing to take.", "In 2001, real interest rates on long-term government bonds averaged around 3 percent internationally.", "Real interest rates have since fallen and long-term real interest rates are now at a historical low of between 0 and 1 percent.", "At the moment, it would seem that economic growth ahead will be more modest than in the favourable pre-crisis years.", "We must therefore be prepared for an extended period of lower returns, even though growth and financial market returns do not always go hand in hand.", "Over time, we expect equities to yield a higher return than bonds.", "Over the past few years, the Fund has increased its allocation to equities, compensating to some extent for low bond yields.", "However, the excess return on equities must be considerable to keep up the overall return on the Fund.", "This is not impossible, but perhaps more than we can expect.", "A bolder investment strategy could compensate for low interest rates, although the risk of substantial losses would also increase.", "This is hardly a tempting path.", "(Table: Estimated real return) Today's situation is different from when the fiscal rule was drawn up in 2001.", "At that time, a real return on the Fund of 4 percent, or a little higher, based on the then prevailing distribution between equities and bonds, was a reasonable assumption.", "Today, calculations yield a lower figure for expected real return3.", "The real return on bonds in the Fund's portfolio can now be estimated at 1 percent.", "With a normal risk premium on equities, the real return on the whole Fund can be quantified at 3 percent.", "There is a possibility that the real return will be higher, but it may also be lower.", "If we spend more than the annual return on the Fund, we will be eating into the savings portion.", "If the return on the Fund actually proves to be 3 percent, we will have drained almost NOK 1 trillion from the Fund over the next 20 years with the current 4 percent rule.", "This corresponds to the value of the large North Sea oil discovery in the Johan Sverdrup field.", "The phasing-in of petroleum revenues through the public sector has the effect of crowding out exposed sectors.", "Even though petroleum revenues are phased in gradually, a phasingout of manufacturing and other private industries may not be as smooth.", "Entire industries could be lost.", "If spending proves to be excessive, such structural changes may be difficult or impossible to reverse.", "The conclusion is that a more robust approach would now be to base fiscal policy on an annual expected real return on the Fund of 3 percent.", "Such an adjustment would underpin the main principles that were behind the establishment of the fiscal rule - stability and sustainability.", "(Chart 10: Structural non-oil deficit and different rules for withdrawal from In 2011 the structural non-oil budget deficit was about 3 percent of the Fund,

manoeuvre in economic policy.", "However, a number of enterprises are feeling the impact of the downturn abroad.", "Some segments of the export industry are feeling the effects of lower turnover and a strong krone.", "At the same time, house prices and household debt are still rising.", "Investors' view of the economic outlook has improved since the beginning of the year, and financial market funding has been more accessible.", "Banks should make use of the opportunity to obtain more long-term funding.", "This will increase their resilience to any further deepening of the crisis in Europe.", "The current optimism may be fragile.", "Should credit markets dry up again, Norges Bank is prepared to implement measures to enable banks to maintain normal credit standards.", "However, liquidity provision by Norges Bank should not replace sound liquidity management in banks or banks' long-term market funding.", "Any decisions regarding the use of the government's or taxpayers'

lending rates is unusually wide at present.", "Many households pay a mortgage interest rate of around 4 percent, and rates on corporate loans are between 5 and 6 percent.", "Monetary policy is the first line of defence in demand management.", "Norges Bank still has room for manoeuvre in interest rate setting - in both directions.", "The question nonetheless remains of whether it is desirable to use monetary policy to accelerate the pace of inflation when the countries around us are in a recession.", "Even if the krone depreciates somewhat, relatively high cost growth in Norway that could quicken the pace of inflation might lead to a further deterioration in competitiveness.", "This cannot be the way to go.", "Moreover, low interest rates over a prolonged period tend to amplify an upward spiral in house prices and lending.", "Imbalances that build up in credit and property markets can have severe ripple effects further ahead, with a substantial impact on output and employment.", "Many Americans and Europeans have recently experienced this, as Norwegians did 20 years ago.", "Furthermore, external conditions are not likely to help push up inflation in Norway in the period ahead.", "Many countries are facing the prospect of stagnation or decline, and the rise in prices for imported goods is low.", "Our objective is inflation of close to 2.5 percent over time.", "Inflation will be brought up gradually, but not so rapidly as to generate imbalances in the economy.", "Under the current outlook, it will likely take several years before inflation is back

system.", "The consequences came into clear evidence during the financial crisis: banks had inadequate equity capital, excessive short-term wholesale funding and insufficient buffers of highly liquid assets.", "A new and tighter international regulatory framework is intended to remedy this situation.", "Stricter capital adequacy and liquidity coverage standards are in the offing.", "The authorities will also be able to tailor banks' capital requirements to the overall risk in the financial system.", "During upturns, these requirements can be raised, so that banks will have to hold more capital for their loans.", "This will smooth out lending growth and better equip banks to bear losses during downturns.", "It will ease the impact of the marching steps on the bridge.", "There will be a need for higher capital buffers when economic growth is solid and debt builds up.", "This may restrain the build-up of imbalances.", "But when there are no clouds on the horizon, it is easy to lose sight of more long-term considerations.", "The government authorities should therefore provide a clear mandate that ensures independence and delegates the responsibility for determining capital buffers.", "In this regard, we can build on the experience with the framework for monetary policy.", "And any change in capital requirements must be made on the basis of an assessment of the
