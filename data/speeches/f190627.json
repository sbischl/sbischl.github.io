on these efforts, and to further promote green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, the HKMA announced three further sets of measures in May: 15.", "First, a three-phased approach to promote Green and Sustainable Banking.", "(i) In the first phase, we will develop a common framework to assess the existing baseline of individual banks in order to establish how \"green\" they are.", "(ii) The second phase is to engage and consult the industry and other relevant stakeholders to develop our supervisory expectation or requirements, particularly on how to incorporate Environmental, Social and

that priority will be given to Green and ESG investments if the long term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis.", "(iii) Going forward, we will be more proactive in embracing ESG in Exchange Fund investment in both public markets and private assets, for example, by: (a) growing the green bond portfolio by direct investment or investing in green bond funds; (b) on the public equities side, we aim to create ESG mandates by adopting ESG equities index as benchmark for passive portfolio, or by engaging active equities managers who use an ESG filter in equity selection; and (c) in the private markets, we will include green accreditation as a predominant factor for investment in real estate, and will also conduct ESG evaluation as a mandatory part of due diligence of all private markets investments, especially in infrastructure area.", "The third measure is to strengthen our capacity building efforts by launching the Centre for Green Finance (CGF)

Joint Global Coordinators, about half of the investors participating in our deal could be loosely defined as \"green investors\".", "By going through the issuance process ourselves, along with the help of external parties, we have hopefully showcased to potential green bond issuers, both locally and overseas, that Hong Kong is a convenient platform for issuing green bonds, for three reasons: (i) Hong Kong has a strong presence of finance and legal professionals, who can advise on all aspects of the bond offering and assist in arranging, managing, co-ordinating and marketing the green bond certification and issuance; (ii) Hong Kong combines the best market practice from internationally renowned green reviewers and local agencies.", "For example, we obtained a Second Party Opinion from Vigeo Eiris for the Green Bond Framework and the inaugural transaction under the Framework has also received the \"Green Finance Certificate\" (Pre-issuance) from the HKQAA; and (iii) Hong Kong is home to leading international institutional investors, including many of the investors who have made strong commitments to green investments.", "During the roadshow for the green bond, we were joined
