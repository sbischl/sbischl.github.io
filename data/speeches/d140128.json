progress at the global front.", "Besides the traditional Islamic finance markets of the Middle East, financial centers across various Western countries are also accepting and recognizing the viability and utility of this alternate financial system.", "In particular the relative resilience of Islamic financial institutions during the recent financial crisis due to its asset backed nature and being

academic institutions at the international level working and providing support for maintaining the high pace growth of the Islamic finance industry.", "Pakistan, with more than 95 percent Muslim population, and a constitutional obligation of ensuring a riba free economic system, has had a favorable response to Islamic finance.", "Pakistan is amongst the pioneers of Islamic finance as we started planning for nurturing the Shariah compliant financial system way back in 1970s, and made a bold attempt in 1980s to bring the whole banking and financial system in conformity with Shariah principles.", "The pioneering work of 1980s particularly on the legal and regulatory front has been a source of guidance and inspiration for many countries that initiated Islamic finance in the 1980s and 90s.", "The attempt to transform the whole system however, met with limited success largely due to slippages at the implementation and execution stage.", "This lead us to re-launch Islamic banking in 2001 in parallel to conventional banking thus allowing both Islamic and conventional banks to co-exist and enabling the consumers to do banking with the system of their choice and preference.", "This approach has proved to be a huge success in promoting Islamic banking in the country and ensuring its demand driven development.", "The industry has been growing at an impressive annual growth rate of over 30 percent over the last five years with sustained growth momentum despite significantly increased base.", "Islamic Banking is currently spread across 80 districts of the country with a

industry.", "We have also given a comprehensive and multi-tiered Shariah compliance framework to ensure Shariah conformity of Islamic banks' operations.", "To further strengthen the Shariah compliance environment in Islamic banks we have also developed a Shariah Governance Framework, which explicitly defines the Shariah related roles and responsibilities of all key organs of IBIs including Board of Directors, the executive management and Shariah Boards.", "It also institutionalizes the Shariah compliance function in IBIs.", "Moreover, to develop an effective prudential and risk management framework for Islamic finance, an incremental approach was adopted wherein new regulations for only such areas and risks of Islamic banks were developed which were not being covered by conventional prudential regulations and risk management framework.", "Further, in order to align its regulatory framework with international regulatory standards and best practices, SBP regularly reviews and evaluates the standards issued by IFSB, AAOIFI, and IIFM for their possible implementation keeping in view our local legal, regulatory and economic environment.", "Last year we issued landmark Instructions for Profit & Loss Distribution and Pool Management for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs), which were well received both locally and internationally.", "The instructions are aimed at

Islamic microfinance banks, Islamic microfinance services by full-fledged Islamic banks and Islamic microfinance Divisions in conventional microfinance banks.", "This, coupled with its inherent checks

policy makers.", "Despite significant improvement during the last decade, still a large segment of our population does not have adequate understanding of Islamic finance and is unable to comprehend its distinction over conventional finance.", "The State Bank therefore, besides developing a supportive regulatory and supervisory framework, is also actively engaged in undertaking awareness creation and capacity building initiatives through its awareness campaign whereby targeted seminars and conferences are being organized for the business community, academia, bankers and policy makers throughout the country.", "In this context, the most significant milestone that has been achieved in the recent past is the launch of an industry wide media campaign under the support and guidance of SBP.", "This campaign is targeted to address mass awareness issues by using print, electronic and digital media.", "Further, SBP has recently developed a five year Strategic Plan (2014-18) for the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan in consultation with all key stakeholders, which gives a consensus agenda and strategy to take the industry to its next level of growth and development.", "The plan has an extensive focus on improving public perception of Islamic banking as a distinct and viable system capable of catering to the varied financial services needs of various segments of the society.", "It envisages intensifying the awareness creation efforts, strengthening consultation mechanism with stakeholders, removing confusion and inconsistencies in legal, regulatory and taxation

the prudential and Shariah standards in Pakistan.", "I would also like to mention here that SBP is also a key member of the recently constituted steering committee for the promotion of Islamic banking by the government which is mandated to devise a comprehensive policy framework for the Islamic financial system, suggest practical steps needed to be taken for implementing Shariah-based financial system, and propose solutions for the Islamic secondary market / money market for liquidity management.", "These initiatives on part of the government sends a clear signal that the present government views Islamic banking and finance as an integral part of the overall financial system.", "We at SBP share the same view and believe that steps like these can go a long way in further increasing the scope of the industry in the country.", "Innovation requires research, hence it is imperative that the industry players give utmost importance to research in their organizations.", "I am pleased to inform this esteemed audience that SBP has a dedicated team of researchers focusing on key areas relevant to the industry.", "We have recently conducted an extensive survey based study of 10,000 household across the country to assess the demand for Islamic banking and its attributes.", "The results of the survey will be shared with the industry soon and are highly encouraging as there is a huge untapped demand for Islamic banking in the country; and an even faster pace expansion of the industry would be needed to fill the demand and supply gap in the medium to long term.", "I would like to reiterate the full support and ownership of SBP in developing and nurturing a sound and stable financial system that meets the Shariah principles in letter and spirit.", "We will work with the
