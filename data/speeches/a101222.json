SNB's foreign exchange market interventions.", "Since the beginning of 2010, the balance sheet total has increased from CHF 207 billion to some CHF 280 billion.", "Moreover, the significant

the SNB associated with the lengthening of the balance sheet.", "After the beginning of the financial crisis, the SNB lowered money market interest rates to virtually zero.", "Despite these decisive reductions in interest rates, the Swiss economy faced the threat of deflation from March 2009 onwards.", "This required the SNB, as part of its mandate, to undertake a further monetary policy

conditional inflation forecast in more detail.", "The (dashed) red curve on the chart represents the new, conditional inflation forecast.", "It shows the future path of inflation, assuming that the three-month Libor remains constant at 0.25% over the entire forecast horizon, and it covers the period from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2013.", "For purposes of comparison, the

inflation remains low for 2011 and 2012.", "The forecast for the next few quarters is revised because new data has been taken into account.", "The new forecast for 2011 is slightly above that published in September because the oil price has increased.", "The increase in inflation in the third quarter of 2011 is attributable to a base effect, because inflation in the third quarter of 2010 was comparatively low.", "Compared to the forecast published in September, inflation in 2012 and 2013 rises less steeply, particularly due to the fact that the economic outlook for Europe is less favourable than in the previous quarter.", "Towards the end of the forecast horizon, inflation rises briskly and exceeds the upper bound of 2%, assuming that the three-month Libor remains at the current level.", "This shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be pursued for the entire forecast horizon without compromising long-term price stability.", "Due to the risks
