contributed to the rise in property prices and debt accumulation.", "Asset prices generally will react to changes in short-term interest rates, but one would expect such movements to more or less even out over the cycle.", "But more fundamental forces have also been at play.", "First, the neutral real interest rate has probably fallen substantially over the past 5-10 years, maybe as much as 2 percentage points.", "Such a fall in the discount factor should have a large impact on asset prices like property and land.", "Second, Norway has recently experienced very strong, positive income shocks.", "For capital and labour that flow freely across borders, prices primarily reflect global growth and competitive conditions.", "The price of fixed capital, such as land, however, will be

prices.", "This is a real economic effect, which monetary policy over time cannot eliminate.", "It is very difficult to establish whether rapidly increasing asset and house prices are bubbles, or whether the price increases are driven primarily by economic fundamentals.", "If we were convinced of the existence of a bubble and had the necessary instruments available, we should act.", "But it is not our conviction that monetary policy can in any meaningful way control asset price developments.", "Low and stable consumer price inflation is the operational target of monetary policy.", "There

policy here?", "Yes, as in the case of other negative supply shocks: Keeping inflation low and stable must be the overriding objective.", "And with regard to reducing emissions, keeping inflation low
