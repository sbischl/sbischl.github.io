Balance to contain speculative actions but not to discourage investments and balance to maintain financial and macroeconomic stability but not to stifle competition and growth.", "As the central monetary authority, we need to find this delicate point of policy equilibrium when the potential impact of policy on key market parameters such as on exchange and interest rates won't outweigh the economic virtues of an open market.", "The issue here is not individual risks of products and transactions.", "Instead, it is about the risks to the system from the possible build-up of risks.", "Risks that could eventually spill over across stakeholders, products, transactions and sub-markets.", "We need therefore to be attentive to the possibility of downstream risks even when the picture upstream looks overtly robust and rosy.", "This is the challenge of prudently asking ourselves constantly \"What can go wrong?\"", "and to prepare accordingly for such possibilities.", "To us at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, this is at the heart the very essence of ensuring financial stability.", "And, as complex a challenge as it may be, it represents our central policy framework moving forward.", "The environment we operate in is not static.", "And we envision that our reform agenda will remain dynamic as policy developments emerge and market needs arise.", "But, even as the components of this agenda can change, the ultimate and driving goal remains the same.", "Our agenda will cover the Basel Accord on capitalization and other financial standards, as well as policy reforms on OTC Derivatives and financial market infrastructures.", "We also encourage banks to become more proactive in doing their part to broaden the reach of financial education.", "On its own, the BSP implements finance education programs across different age groups to empower Filipinos to save, invest and manage their resources with prudence, to avoid scams and to protect their rights as bank customers.", "To us, financial education is valuable not only for empowering our people but also in enhancing the stability of our financial system.", "This should also lead to improvements in the savings rate in our country which lag behind that of our neighbours.", "Certainly, our agenda moving forward calls for a collective effort as the ramifications and accountabilities cut across different financial institutions and regulatory agencies.", "In this period of change, it is important that we agree on the direction we want to take the system.", "And having agreed, the stakeholders must collaborate on working on such changes in ways and forms as may be required by circumstances, for the greater good.", "We have seen how successful cooperation between the BSP and the banking sector generated long-term benefits for our country and our people.", "For this, the BSP and the Members of the Monetary Board thank the leaders, the management and the staff of the Philippine banking community.", "Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat!", "We also thank our guests from other sectors of our country for taking time to join us tonight.", "We are heartened by your show of support.", "As the economist Adam Smith once said, and I quote: \"civilized society stands at all times in need of the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes.\"", "It is our hope therefore that the same spirit of cooperation and collaboration will characterize our pursuit of continuing reforms in 2013 and the years ahead.", "And now, let us offer a toast to all of us coming together for an even stronger, more responsive, more inclusive, and more successful Philippine banking system that will underpin a strong and vibrant Philippine economy that will bring prosperity and a better quality of life to our country and our people."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["financial stability", "banking sector", "monetary policy", "economic growth", "inflation", "capital flows", "prudential regulation", "financial education", "Basel Accord", "OTC Derivatives"]}
