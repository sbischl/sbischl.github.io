evaluate their effects, consolidate what we need to preserve, and fine-tune what we need to improve.", "Second, to position regulation for the technological changes sweeping the financial industry - harness the opportunities they present while managing their risks.", "Taking stock of post-crisis regulatory reforms Reaffirming the rationale In taking stock of the reforms, let us begin with why we embarked on them.", "It is easy to forget how close the world came to a full-blown depression as a result of the financial crisis in 2008.", "The global financial crisis was remorseless in the wake of destruction that it unleashed upon the economy and society.", "The cumulative loss of output since the crisis is estimated to be 25% of one year's world gross domestic product .", "For the US alone, estimates of the output loss from the crisis vary from US$6 trillion to US$22 trillion .", "The crisis revealed deep fault lines in the financial system: financial institutions that leveraged themselves to the hilt (as much as 40 dollars of debt to 1 dollar of equity) and had severe mismatches in liquidity; lax underwriting standards, made worse by conflicts of interest in banks originating an opaque OTC derivatives market, leading to rapid contagion when liquidity suddenly dried up.", "The Financial Stability Board (FSB), working closely with standard-setting bodies, put in place over the last eight years a comprehensive set of regulatory reforms to address these fault-lines.", "The aim is to make the financial system less prone to crisis and more resilient in the event of crisis.", "There are three key thrusts.", "First, strengthening the banks.", "This is being done through the Basel III reforms, increasing capital buffers, setting liquidity requirements, and constraining leverage.", "Second, making derivatives markets safer.", "This is being done through requirements for trade reporting, central clearing, and margining.", "Third, tackling the too-big-to-fail problem.", "Global systemically important financial institutions have been identified and are being subject to higher capital requirements, more intensive supervision, and resolution planning.", "Evaluating the impact With the rule-making largely done and implementation generally making good progress, it is time to evaluate the impact of the regulatory reforms.", "The FSB is developing a framework to do this, focusing on two key questions: effectiveness - are the reforms achieving their intended outcomes?", "effects - what are their broader social benefits and costs of the reforms?", "This work is especially important in the current context.", "First, the regulatory changes of the last eight years are substantial, especially when taken cumulatively.", "It is incumbent on us as regulators to be accountable for these changes, to evaluate objectively their intended outcomes as well as any unintended consequences.", "Second, with memories of the crisis fading and the compliance burden of new regulation continuing to grow, pressures have begun to mount to unwind some of the reforms.", "Any adjustments to be made should be grounded in an objective assessment of the impact of the reforms.", "How effective have the reforms been?", "The preliminary assessment is encouraging.", "Large banks are now stronger, more liquid, less leveraged, less complex.", "Derivatives markets are safer, with central clearing covering more than 90% of OTC derivatives trades in 14 major jurisdictions.", "The financial system as a whole seems more robust and more resilient.", "The system has remained resilient through several episodes of market stress, ranging from the 2014 US Treasury \"flash crash\", and the 2015 Swiss Franc de-pegging to the 2016 Brexit vote.", "What have been the overall effects of the reforms?", "Work in this area is nascent, there are no clear answers yet.", "But let me sketch some of the key issues.", "In each of these areas, we are confronted with the problem of attribution.", "It appears that regulation has had some role but we do not know how much of a role alongside other factors.", "Let me begin with market liquidity.", "There are concerns that liquidity has declined in some markets.", "Preliminary evidence indicates there is less depth and potentially less resilience under stressed market conditions .", "Some of the blame has been ascribed to the emergence of more automated trading, which has little to do with regulation.", "But other factors - such as less market making by dealer banks and increased post-trade transparency in corporate bond markets - appear to have stemmed from regulation.", "The profitability of several large banks today is below the cost of capital.", "Banks need to be profitable in order to be strong.", "Retained earnings are one of the major sources of equity - which is the highest quality capital that banks hold.", "Unprofitable banks are a potential source of instability.", "Banks also need to be profitable to be able to support the real economy.", "They have to earn a decent return for intermediating credit, otherwise they will do less of it.", "Bank profitability has come under pressure from a combination of the three realities of the postcrisis financial landscape: slow growth, easy money, tight regulation.", "More work is needed to discern the impact each of these factors is having on bank profitability.", "Be that as it may, as we put the finishing touches to the Basel III reforms, it is important that the overall capital requirements on banks not be increased significantly.", "It is also quite clear that the cost of risk management and compliance has exploded and this is something regulators need to be alert to.", "According to a Thomson Reuters report, more than one-third of financial firms spend at least an entire day each week tracking regulatory change .", "The headcount for legal, compliance, and regulatory matters has grown significantly in financial firms, in some case, even doubling.", "Third, have regulatory reforms contributed to strong, sustainable, and balanced economic growth?", "This is much tougher to answer, but this is the central question.", "Across most countries, overall credit provision to the economy has been stable despite higher capital and liquidity requirements.", "The cost of financing has remained low, although this has had do with highly accommodative monetary policies, which are not permanent.", "But there are distributional effects that we need to monitor closely.", "Studies suggest that small business loans have been shrinking as a share of non-bank loans in the US.", "Small banks are trimming product lines and pulling back from certain customer segments.", "Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have expressed concerns that global banks have been reducing their activities in these markets as they review their business models in light of the new regulatory environment.", "The FSB is keeping a close watch on this.", "We have rightly focused our regulatory efforts to minimise the risk of another financial crisis.", "But we must continually ensure that we do so without minimising economic growth and opportunity.", "Fine-tuning regulation We must be careful to avoid \"pendulum swings\" in regulation that could undermine the gains in financial stability that we have achieved, not to mention prolong and add to the uncertainties facing the financial industry.", "That regulations have imposed costs on the economy is in itself not sufficient reason to unwind them.", "These costs have to be weighed against the benefits of a more stable financial system to support sustainable economic growth.", "De-regulation has its own costs.", "Having said that, some fine-tuning may be necessary to reduce the unintended effects of reforms while preserving their benefits.", "Regulatory policy must continually seek the fine line between discouraging excessive risktaking and encouraging innovation.", "We should not be afraid to adjust and fine-tune where necessary.", "As Dan Tarullo, former governor of the Federal Reserve Board, says with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations in the US, \"some recalibrations and reconsiderations will be warranted on the basis of experience.\"", "There are two key principles to keep in mind as we fine-tune regulations: risk proportionality and global consistency.", "Risk proportionality We need to be mindful of proportionality when applying international regulatory standards.", "Subjecting banks of different sizes, different scope of activity, and different degrees of internationalisation, to the same rules is not appropriate.", "Most of the new regulations were designed with large, cross-border financial institutions in mind.", "They are a poor fit for smaller institutions - like local community banks and finance companies - that tend to pose fewer systemic risks.", "Here in the US, there are concerns that post-crisis regulations have been unduly punitive on smaller banks and have affected their ability to support small businesses.", "Regulators need to review their frameworks to ensure they remain risk proportionate.", "They are not starting from a blank slate.", "In the US, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act already exempts firms with less than $50 billion in assets from the tougher prudential requirements.", "And Bill Dudley, President of the New York Fed, has suggested: \"... this threshold could be raised significantly without unduly increasing the risk to the broader financial system.\"", "Global consistency Adjustments to domestic regulation must not lead to inconsistency with agreed international standards.", "Global harmonisation of regulation enables fair competition and minimises regulatory arbitrage.", "Harmonisation does not mean identical rules.", "We therefore need to establish effective mechanisms to recognise and defer to one another's national regulatory regimes.", "Conflicting rules on cross-border OTC derivatives trading is a case in point.", "If not resolved, it may fragment global markets into distinct liquidity pools that are less resilient to market shocks.", "Christopher Giancarlo, Acting Chairman of the CFTC, has put it well: \"It is critical that we make sure our rules do not conflict and fragment the global marketplace ... the CFTC should operate on the basis of comity, not uniformity, with overseas regulators.\"", "Adjustments to domestic regulation must not impede the globalisation of finance and the free flow of capital.", "Breaking up large banks or trapping capital and liquidity through ring-fencing measures may make them easier to resolve but could weaken their ability to respond to different stress scenarios.", "Ring-fencing could also hinder the ability of global banks to provide connectivity and facilitate intermediation across different pools of capital, especially in EMDEs.", "If global finance is fragmented, both financial stability and financial inclusion could suffer.", "I come from a small country.", "And we small countries have an instinctive pull towards international standards and a global system.", "This may seem to matter less to large countries.", "But may I suggest that all countries today are smaller than they used to be, or smaller than they think they are.", "Smaller in the sense that what happens outside our borders has an increasingly larger impact on what happens inside.", "The US has much to gain from continuing to work alongside other regulators, exercise leadership where needed, and help to shape and promote international regulatory standards.", "International cooperation necessarily involves some compromises.", "The benefit of such give-and-take is a safer global financial system that benefits all countries.", "Positioning regulation for technological innovation and cyber risks Let me move now to the second key priority of financial regulation going forward -
