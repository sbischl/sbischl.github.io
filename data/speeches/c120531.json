policy measures on the youth in particular If the consequences of youth unemployment are considered more serious than those of other age groups, it may be justified to focus measures particularly on the youth.", "At the same time many measures aimed at lowering unemployment in general, affect the young unemployed more than other age groups.", "This is why often general measures to lower unemployment are most important for the young unemployed.", "They can be complemented but not replaced by specific measures which focus only on the young.", "We can assess the youth unemployment also

relevant with ageing populations.", "Unemployment insurance reforms should activate workers and avoid income traps Generous and long lasting unemployment insurance policies are criticized for their passivating effect on job search.", "For this reason many countries (e.g.", "Germany) have recently adopted policies aiming at activating workers.", "The measures include reducing overall the level

income leads to a larger drop in social benefits.", "Effectively this implies a marginal tax rate of over 100%, which reduces labour supply.", "Measures that allow for some earmings before losing social benefits have been implemented for example in the German Hartz reforms.", "Return to education in bad times may be rational In recessions young workers exit the labour force more than other age groups.", "In many cases the young return to education, which may be a rational choice considering the lower opportunity cost of studying (expected value of job search is lower).", "Also a higher educational level improves labour market prospects for the worker.", "Promoting transitions to education by increasing temporarily the number students may be optimal from the society's perspective as well, as the opportunity cost in terms of lost output is lower in a recession.", "(ii) Labour demand The demand for young workers may be associated with both cyclical and structural elements.", "When unemployment and youth unemployment is due to a cyclical weakness in aggregate demand, unemployment is involuntary (and supply policies may be relatively weak).", "In recent years, efforts to sustain aggregate demand have been implemented through expansive fiscal policies.", "In the longer term this is not sustainable due to public finance constraints.", "Fiscal stimulus may also not address the underlying structural problems, such as the reduced competitiveness or the structural change needed in the economy.", "A part of the job losses are permanent During the crisis the level of output has dropped to a lower level in many countries, and part of the job losses are permanent.", "This means that a recovery will not necessarily bring back the lost jobs.", "It is possible that labour costs must fall, to bring employment back to its pre-crisis level.", "The productivity of a worker and the cost of labour determine its demand In the longer term the key factors for labour demand are the productivity of a worker and the price of labour, namely, the costs that accrue to the employer from a worker.", "The wage is, of course, an essential part of the costs, but the employer also bears other wage related costs, possible training, search and firing costs.", "Wage formation that leads to a wage distribution that is more compressed than the productivity distribution, tends to weaken young workers employment.", "The price of a labour is the wage.", "The productivity of young workers is often lower than that of older ones, but wages do not always fully reflect this productivity difference.", "If personnel reductions are focused on those for whom the productivity-wage difference (profitability) is the lowest, the reductions will primarily be on the young workers.", "Overall, wage formation that leads to a wage distribution that is more compressed than the productivity distribution, tends to weaken young workers employment.", "A wage distribution that is narrower than the productivity distribution may be caused by a number of factors.", "These include aiming at wage inequality, wage bargaining institutions that represent the median worker or insider workers or minimum wages.", "A rapid rise in unit labour costs (wages that rise faster than productivity) may also endanger especially the jobs of the youth.", "Many countries have reduced minimum wages for young workers Minimum wages often concern the least educated and least productive workers, and often young people often fall into this category.", "Thus, the level of minimum wages is potentially important for the employment of young workers.", "In fact, many countries have reduced minimum wages for young workers, for example, 80% of the minimum wage.", "A reduced minimum wage is, however, meaningful only in countries where there is a significant share of workers working at the minimum wage (for example in France).", "One wage related measure is to reduce the employers' social contributions to targeted groups, such as low-productivity workers (often young), to promote employment of young persons.", "This is on the other hand has to take into account the losses to public finances caused by the reduction and substitute them from other sources.", "Apprenticeship places that pay a sub-minimum wage, and where the contracts include a training commitment from the employer, have been

"Fixed-term contracts are common, particularly among young workers and ideally they can act as a \"bridge\" to a permanent position.", "But the temporary contracts are in a weaker position relative to ongoing contracts, and layoffs have been concentrated on fixed-term contracts.", "So young people are in general in a weaker position due to their over-representation in these contracts.", "For fixed-term contracts to be converted into permanent ones more frequently, the threshold for converting should become lower.", "A proposed solution has been that the firing cost would be gradually increasing with the duration of employment relationship (e.g.", "Then a large jump in the firing cost when continuing the employment relationship, would be avoided.", "(iii) Mismatch and reallocation The recovery in European economies and the success in reallocating the surplus labour from permanently downsized sectors to more resilient ones are intertwined and will determine the economic fortunes of European economies in the years to come.", "If there is a problem of mismatch, a recovery or expasionary policies will not likely lower such structural unemployment Indeed, understanding the nature of euro area unemployment has important policy implications.", "When unemployment is cyclical and due to a lack of job creation, a pick-up in economic growth or expansionary policies will tend to reduce unemployment.", "However, when there is a mismatch between job vacancies and available workers, a recovery in growth or expansionary policies will not affect such structural unemployment much.", "Mismatch calls for measures that improve matching efficiency, along with adjustment in workers skills and adjustment in relative wages This calls for measures that improve matching efficiency

young person to obtain and retain a job, as well as to being able to learn in a job.", "Especially for marginalized youth, education outside of the class room has been successful, so that the youth are continuously exposed to a work environment and accumulate experience.", "German style apprenticeship programs have been found to pave the way from education to working life.", "Wages provide incentives Wages provide incentives.", "The relative wages of different occupations should reflect demand and supply conditions and direct young workers to those sectors and occupations where work is available.", "Is the \"German labour market miracle\" a textbook example of successful reforms?", "In Germany both unemployment and youth unemployment have continued during the crisis, now the unemployment rate being at its lowest rate in two decades, at 6% and youth unemployment at 8.5%.", "Although this impressive evolution of unemployment and youth unemployment is in part due to better economic development than in other euro area countries, the German labor market institutions play a role.", "The target of the German labor market institutions and reforms has not been the youth only, but because the youth are at \"the margin\", meaning that changes in unemployment affect them more than proportionately, the general labour market reforms have successfully also reduced youth

training programme.", "All of these include elements that promote the fall in youth unemployment.", "Hartz reforms aimed at both labour supply and demand The Hartz reforms included a number of

had a positive employment effect during the crisis.", "Short time working arrangements may amplify insider-outsider problems in the German The Kurzarbeit programme has, however, been beneficial

tradeoff: current employment vs. restructuring The short time working schemes may also involve a short-term vs. long term tradeoff.", "Although these schemes have been successful in mitigating the

harderneed for restructuring later.", "Apprenticeships have served well to lead youth to jobs In Germany vocational training is based on apprenticeships.", "About a quarter of employers offer
