light summer nights.", "But November it is, and not without reason.", "You all know that the Governor of Norges Bank, Svein Gjedrem, will soon have served his two terms.", "The governor will step down at the end of the year.", "The Governor has always believed that too much attention is paid to persons and there is too little focus on the position that the person holds.", "By organising this

useful central bank?\"", "But before we can answer that question, we need to answer the question, \"What is a central bank?\"", "This may sound like a naive question, especially coming from someone with twenty-five years' work experience at Norges Bank.", "In recent years, however, I have begun to reflect on the question of what a central bank is.", "There are two reasons for this reflection.", "First I naturally have an interest in the history of Norges Bank.", "If we look back in time, for example, to the establishment of Norges Bank in 1816, a central bank was something completely

there was manufacturing, consumption, barter, investment and trade.", "There was also a rudimentary credit market and monetary system.", "Commercial credit was available, savers met investors and bills of exchange were discounted.", "But these markets were rather inefficient: their margins were high, the supply of credit meagre and uncertainty high.", "Most activities associated nowadays with a monetary system took place in the \"unregulated markets,\" to use the current term.", "Accounts were kept, but not always in the nume\u0301raire we think of today.", "For example, this is described in the local history of Karls\u00f8y and Helg\u00f8y, up in northern Norway, where at that time accounts were sometimes kept in commodities such as cod liver oil, saithe or flour.", "However, one of

framework for macroprudential policies is likely to differ from one country to another.", "The Governor touched on these questions in yesterday's speech.", "To sum up: Perhaps my question was not so naive after all.", "The examples above show that there is not an obvious answer to \"what defines a central bank\".", "Nevertheless, some key principles may apply, both historically and across national borders: As early as 1873 Walter Bagehot1 formulated the well known general principles for the role of central banks.", "He said: \"To avert panic, central banks should lend early and freely (without limit), to solvent firms, against good collateral, and at \"high rates\" The events in 2008 showed us that the lender of last resort function continues to be of the utmost relevance and importance.", "The financial crisis also illustrated that central banks have an important role in creating and providing liquidity.", "\uf0b7 In addition, the establishment of Norges Bank in 1816 and the Bank's intervention in the money markets in 2008 show that central banks also have an important role as \"market maker of last resort\".", "Searching for answers Even if we can provide some
