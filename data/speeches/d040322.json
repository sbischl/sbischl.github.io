affects companies' profit margins.", "But enterprises will respond by reducing their costs.", "This will occur in part in the individual business, but subcontractors will also be required to reduce their prices and enhance efficiency.", "Therefore, increased competition usually triggers higher productivity growth in the economy.", "Low inflation may therefore be matched by growth in productivity.", "Prices for domestically produced goods and services are expected to rise towards the beginning of 2005 due to higher capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy.", "Strong

2004, but probably at a slower rate than in 2003.", "Low interest rates and house price inflation imply higher housing investment in the period ahead.", "Fiscal policy also contributes to stimulating activity.", "The impact of the interest rate decline on private consumption is likely to be stronger this year than in 2003.", "It takes time for changes in Norges Bank's key rate to feed through fully to interest rates for households.", "Norges Bank's calculations show that if we look at 2003 and 2004 as a whole, it appears that the impact of interest rate changes will result in an overall reduction of about NOK 15bn in household net interest expenses before tax.", "However, due to the increase in household net debt, net interest expenses will fall much less than this.", "The impact of the interest rate decline is also conditioned by the expected duration of the low interest rate level.", "When the sight deposit rate was reduced last autumn, longer interest rates showed relatively little change.", "The interest rate reductions in December and January, combined with the decline in inflation, have had a stronger impact on long-term interest rates.", "This indicates that financial market participants expect interest rates to remain low for a longer period.", "The fall in the value of the krone over the past year has strengthened Norwegian business and industry.", "With lower

industries in Western Norway and Northern Norway has generated a positive impetus to the construction industry.", "Activity in 2003 in the rest of the country has mainly been held up by public investment projects.", "Information from our regional network indicates that construction activity has picked up markedly in most regions.", "This also applies to Rogaland.", "In recent year, non-residential investment has accounted for more than a third of total investment in services and distributive trades.", "The large investments in this sector in the latter half of the 1990s has led to a high non-residential vacancy rate.", "Statistics Norway's new price index for non-residential commercial property shows that in Norway as a whole, prices peaked in the first half of 2001 and have

will also increase as a result of the Orme Lange project.", "This is also the case for Rogaland.", "Our regional network reports that demand is on the increase, the market outlook for the next six months is favourable and corporate profitability has improved considerably.", "The economic upturn is primarily being reinforced and driven by stronger household demand, although without any substantial increase in investment or employment.", "The upturn has both broadened out and gained momentum in the past months.", "All sectors report stable or increasing demand and sales.", "The

these sectors is lower than the national average.", "Manufacturing and oil and gas production are important in Rogaland, but the internationally exposed sector is also relatively large.", "Employment in Rogaland is mainly concentrated in engineering, shipbuilding and construction of oil platforms.", "Many are also employed in the food and beverage industry, and Rogaland is an important farming county.", "The labour market in Norway has improved.", "The number of persons employed in Norway began to increase in summer 2003 and unemployment stabilised.", "Employment in distributive trades has increased.", "There are also signs that employment is rising in education, the public sector and health and social services, from the weak levels recorded in the first six months of last year.", "Manufacturing employment remained well below the level one year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2003, but is falling at a slower pace.", "Unemployment has been fairly stable.", "Adjusted for seasonal variations, LFS unemployment stood at 4.6 per cent of the labour force as measured by Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS) in the fourth quarter of 2003.", "Growth in household demand, petroleum investment and increased activity in the business sector are paving the way for a rise in employment in the period ahead.", "On the other hand, intensified competition and continued rationalisation in the business sector may have a dampening impact on labour demand.", "This year, employment growth is expected to be fairly moderate even if there is a sharp rise in output.", "Only a slight decrease in unemployment is projected for 2004.", "Unemployment is projected to edge down in 2005 and 2006.", "After several years of high wage growth, pay increases in last year's settlement were more moderate.", "Annual wage growth was nonetheless 41\u20442% as substantial increases with effect from 2003 were awarded in the 2002 main wage settlement.", "Wage growth is projected to decline to 33\u20444% this year.", "The labour market appears to be improving somewhat more rapidly than expected previously.", "In isolation, this may contribute to pushing up wage growth relative to previous projections.", "The effect is, however, expected to be more than offset by the prospects of very low inflation this year.", "In 2005 and 2006, wage growth is projected to increase as a result of a tighter labour market and higher inflation.", "There has been a tendency in recent years for a larger portion of pay increases to be agreed in the first year of the two-year period covered by the main agreement.", "If we consider these two-year periods together, the estimated relationship between wage growth and developments in the labour market are approximately in line with that observed since the mid-1990s.", "Developments in real economic variables are mirrored in credit markets.", "In recent years, household income has shown solid growth, and household confidence has been high.", "However, corporate earnings have been low, and until recently enterprises have primarily focused on enhancing efficiency.", "Credit developments are giving ambiguous signals to our interest-rate setting.", "Growth in household borrowing is high, but enterprises are reducing debt.", "The change in the breakdown of credit may have been amplified by banks' increased eagerness to extend credit to households after a period of losses on loans to the business sector.", "Some reports from our regional network indicate that there are some restraints on credit for the business sector in some areas.", "Developments in credit to enterprises shadow developments in their investments.", "Low credit growth indicates that mainland business investment has not yet picked up.", "Total credit is expanding broadly in line with normal growth in nominal GDP.", "Norwegian households generally finance their mortgages at an interest rate that follows the short-term money market rate.", "Floating interest rates tend to vary widely over time.", "The interest rate level is very low at present, and long-term investments cannot rely on this interest rate spanning the life of a housing loan.", "According to money market expectations, the interest rate will eventually stabilise around 51\u20442 per cent.", "This is consistent with an inflation target of 21\u20442 per cent and a long-term real interest rate in line with the level abroad.", "This interest rate, with a mark-up for banks' margins, provides a more realistic expression of the interest rate level that will apply over the loan's life than the floating interest rate prevailing today.", "It may prove to be particularly challenging for borrowers to assess their debt-servicing capacity over time in a period when the interest rate is abnormally low.", "Such a low interest rate also places particular demands on banks in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers.", "But experience has shown that the underlying cause of loan defaults can be overly optimistic assessments on the part of both the lender and borrower.", "House prices and developments in household credit influence consumption and housing investment.", "We seek to take account of these indirect effects in interest-rate setting.", "Household debt has increased sharply over the past decade.", "Developments in debt in the 1990s may partly be interpreted as a delayed adaptation to the deregulation of the housing and credit markets in the 1980s after many households experienced financial difficulties following the relaxation.", "Household assets and debt and housing wealth have risen at a markedly faster pace than disposable income, and housing wealth has grown more than net debt from 1994 up to the present.", "The Norwegian economy has experienced both upturns and downturns since 1994, and activity is now approximately on a par with the level prevailing in 1994.", "These changes must therefore be regarded as structural changes.", "We have limited scope for restraining structural changes that occur when households increase their debt over several years to invest in housing and other property and assets.", "An interest rate that would effectively restrain these structural adjustments would also have an adverse impact on output and employment.", "The interest rate can be used to reduce credit demand.", "At present - with low interest rates abroad and a close link between domestic interest rates and the krone - a tighter monetary policy will restrain credit demand primarily because job security would be reduced.", "Household credit demand is closely linked to developments in the housing market.", "Home-owners who have seen the value of their dwellings rise have the possibility of taking up new mortgage-secured loans.", "They free up a portion of their home equity value to finance consumption and other investments.", "House prices in Norway have on average risen by 9 per cent annually between 1995 and 2002.", "House prices have also increased considerably in other countries.", "A sharp and sustained rise in house prices might contribute to high credit growth even after prices have levelled off.", "Since only a portion of the housing stock is sold each year, some dwellings will be sold at a higher price than when they were last sold for a long period.", "This has contributed to sustaining the high level of growth in credit to households in Norway even after the rise in house prices moderated through 2002 and into It is easiest to sell dwellings in the largest cities and some specific areas are particularly attractive.", "Residential property is now a fairly liquid and attractive investment.", "A persistently high rate of increase in house prices may in isolation engender expectations of a further rise and may thus prove to be selfreinforcing for a period.", "Moreover, there now seems to be a tendency towards investing in property and incurring loans at a more mature age so that younger generations not only inherit dwellings, but debt as well.", "Both debt and wealth are on the rise for these more mature age groups.", "Sharp increases in asset prices and debt accumulation may pose a risk to economic stability.", "With a view to mitigating this risk, it will be appropriate in some situations to apply a somewhat longer-thannormal time horizon than two years to attain the inflation target.", "However, at present debt accumulation is high only in the household sector.", "There is little borrowing activity in the enterprise sector.", "House prices are rising, but non-residential property prices are stable.", "Prices for office premises are, however, stable.", "The analyses in the inflation reports indicate that inflation will remain low this year, picking up thereafter.", "The krone depreciation since January 2003 is expected to push up prices for imported consumer goods.", "Overall, mainland GDP growth is projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high in 2005 and 2006.", "With this path for total output, the output gap, as measured here, will shift to slightly positive in 2005 and 2006 from slightly negative this year.", "Projections are based on the technical assumption that the interest rate will move in line with forward rates.", "The assumption implies that the interest rate will be somewhat lower in the near term, but that it will rise gradually from the summer, largely in parallel with the increase in interest rates among our trading partners.", "The krone is assumed to follow the path of the forward exchange rate, which indicates expectations of a fairly stable exchange rate in the period ahead.", "A path that is in line with the projections in the previous Inflation Report (IR 1/04) provides a reasonable balance between the prospects for reaching the inflation target and stable developments in the real economy.", "The aim of monetary policy is higher inflation.", "It is appropriate to be particularly vigilant with regard to developments in consumer prices, but consumer prices may show random variations from one month to the next.", "Later this year, we will receive confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections.", "When inflation increases from a very low level, this will provide a basis for gradually moving towards a more normal short-term interest rate level in Norway.", "This may counter excessive credit growth and excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term.", "Interest rate developments in other countries may also have a considerable impact on the krone and hence on Norwegian interest rates.", "At its meeting on the 11 March, the Executive Board decided to reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point.", "In reaching its decision, the Executive Board had weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually become too strong.", "Furthermore, according to the Executive Board's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 21\u20442 per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance",
