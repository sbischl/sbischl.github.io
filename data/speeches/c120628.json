of them directly derive it from the explicit mandate (Table 1).", "Indeed, the resilience of the financial systems in the emerging markets during the recent global financial crisis owes to financial stability already being an important monetary policy objective (De Gregorio, 2011).", "Even as many EMEs formally adopted inflation targeting (e.g., Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico), in practice they followed a \"flexible inflation targeting\" framework, as discretion was used to respond to shocks and also to pursue other objectives.", "EMEs which did not formally adopt inflation targeting (e.g.", "China, Nigeria, Malaysia and India) have price stability as one of the key objectives of monetary policy (Table 2).", "Multiple instruments, including quantitative tools such as the cash reserve ratio, were used to moderate the pace of domestic credit growth as well as monetary impact of large capital inflows in China, India and Russia.", "In the East Asian EMEs, the importance of financial stability and the need to prevent financial imbalances by active use of macroprudential policy measures was emphasised after the Asian crisis.", "Accordingly, central banks were given either the sole or shared responsibility in pursuing financial stability in addition to the traditional mandate of monetary stability (Watanagase, 2012).", "In South Africa, the prudential regulation and supervision of banks assisted and complemented the central bank in its pursuit of financial system stability.", "Similarly, the Central Bank of Brazil actively used macroprudential measures to deal with emerging financial risks, particularly from excess capital flows in the economy.", "According to a BIS survey (2010), EMEs significantly outnumbered advanced economies as users of some type of macroprudential instrument.", "Global financial crisis highlighted the importance of using a broader set of instruments for financial stability.", "In this regard, most central banks in EMEs where monetary policy and prudential supervision were within their purview seem to have been better equipped to address financial stability issues as compared to advanced economies.", "Now, I turn specifically to our experience in India.", "Financial stability: Indian framework The core functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are enshrined in the preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as, \"to regulate the issue of bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit

1999 empowers it to regulate the foreign exchange market and the oversight of the payment systems is derived from the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.", "Drawing from a wider mandate, monetary policy in India has evolved to have multiple objectives of price stability, financial stability and growth.", "These objectives are not inherently contradictory, rather mutually reinforcing.", "The Reserve Bank's approach recognises that price and financial stability are important for sustaining high levels of growth which is the ultimate objective of public policy.", "The Reserve Bank's approach to financial stability has been proactive and preventive rather than reactive.", "Its role as monetary policy authority, well integrated with macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision, with an implicit mandate for systemic oversight has enabled the Reserve Bank to exploit the synergies across various dimensions (Subbarao, 2011).", "Even before the crisis, the institutional arrangement in the financial sector was already in place for inter-regulatory co-ordination to monitor financial stability in the economy.", "A High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial Markets (HLCCFM) was set up in 1992 with the Governor of the Reserve Bank as Chairman, and the Chiefs of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and the Finance Secretary to Government of India as members.", "However, post-crisis, the collegial approach to financial stability has been further strengthened by constituting the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).", "The FSDC, headed by the Finance Minister, was set up in December 2010 in the wake of the global financial crisis with a specific mandate, inter alia, for systemic financial stability.", "The FSDC is expected to deal with issues relating to financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory co-ordination and macroprudential supervision of the economy including the functioning of large financial conglomerates.", "A Sub-Committee of the FSDC, headed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, replaced the HLCCFM and is the primary operating arm of the FSDC.", "This Sub-Committee has also set up a dedicated Crisis Management Framework.", "In addition, various committees of the Reserve Bank's Central Board monitor financial stability issues: the Board for Financial Supervision reviews the Reserve Bank's supervisory and regulatory initiatives and the Board for Payment and Settlement Systems oversees the overall functioning of the payment system.", "Another development signifying the Reserve Bank's role in the context of financial stability is the setting up of Financial Stability Unit in the Bank in July 2009 with a mandate to conduct effective macroprudential surveillance of the financial system on an ongoing basis and enable early detection of any incipient signs of instability.", "The Reserve Bank also brings out biannual Financial Stability Reports.", "Incidentally, the IMF has just concluded a Financial Sector Assessment Programme, which in fact comes close on the heels of a comprehensive self assessment of financial sector carried out by the Reserve Bank.", "Thus, the RBI is one of those central banks to recognise financial stability as one of the objectives of monetary policy even before the crisis.", "Lessons for central banks In my opinion, the global financial crisis has fundamentally altered the way we used to view monetary policy and financial stability and the interface between them.", "However, there are issues which entail further work in three key areas.", "First, a relook at monetary policy framework in terms of both objectives and instruments towards a clear recognition of financial stability.", "Second, to put in place an appropriate institutional mechanism drawing upon countries' own experience and history for better co-ordination among the concerned regulatory entities to deliver on financial stability.", "Third, address the communication challenge of multiple objectives to preserve central bank credibility to ensure price and financial stability.", "Let me now elaborate on each of these three aspects.", "(i) Monetary policy framework The view that monetary policy framework should allow policymakers to lean against the build-up of financial imbalances, even if near-term inflation expectations remain anchored, is gaining importance.", "While there is little doubt that monetary policy framework of central banks needs to change, the moot point is what should be the ideal monetary policy framework for better analysis of the macroeconomic effects of financial imbalances?", "One approach could be to formally broaden the set of information variables for monetary policy decision making: in a way, for example, the two pillar approach of the ECB or the multiple indicators approach of the Reserve Bank of India that factors in financial considerations into monetary policy.", "The multiple indicators approach has the advantages of broad-basing monetary policy operations on a large set of information such as money, credit, asset prices, interest rates and exchange rate and providing flexibility in the conduct of monetary management.", "Such approach, however, may involve a greater element of judgment.", "At an operational level, the most widely accepted presentation of monetary policy reaction function that combines both inflation and growth objectives is the \"Taylor Rule\".", "The Taylor rule can be augmented by adding financial variables to the standard monetary reaction function based on inflation and the output gap so as to enhance central banks' ability to react to financial stability concerns.", "However, efficiency of such a formulation needs to be tested.", "Whichever framework is adopted, there should be flexibility for the central bank to respond to potential imbalances and the risks, apart from growth and inflation control.", "(ii) Institutional design for better coordination The recent crisis and the subsequent response have shed new light on the critical role of central banks in promoting financial stability.", "However, it needs to be recognised that this added responsibility should not come at the cost of their conventional role for price stability.", "This is more relevant particularly for central banks in EMEs which admittedly, are yet to achieve that level of credibility as their advanced economy counterparts.", "For many EMEs, exchange rate stability is an important objective, and without price stability it is not possible to maintain exchange rate stability.", "Furthermore, the financial markets and institutions have grown in complexity, the oversight and regulation of which could be beyond a single entity such as the central bank.", "Hence, financial stability would have to be a joint responsibility, though the central bank could have a dominant role by virtue of it being the natural lender of last resort.", "However, there is a need to explicitly incorporate the financial stability role of the central bank into its statute to establish an accountability framework.", "The challenge for a central bank is to achieve multiple objectives without losing credibility as a monetary authority solely responsible for price stability.", "This would be possible only if policies implemented by various stakeholders in financial stability are coherent.", "Accordingly, an appropriate design for co-ordination mechanism is required to derive synergies between monetary policy and macroprudential policy and make more effective use of policy tools available with multiple bodies having the mandate of financial stability.", "The design of co-ordination mechanism may, however, vary across countries depending on the nature and size of their financial systems and their own historical experience.", "In fact, efforts towards greater institutionalisation of co-ordination mechanism have already begun.", "Most prominent examples are the newly created bodies, both in advanced countries and EMEs, like the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the US, the Financial Policy Committee (Interim) in the UK, the European Systemic Risk Board for the European Union, Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk Council in France, Financial Stability Council in Chile, Council for the Stability of the Financial System in Mexico and Financial Stability and Development Council in India (Table 3).", "In some other countries, financial stability framework has been strengthened by setting up committees in central banks to gauge systemic risk (e.g., Brazil in 2011).", "Under the new institutional design, as shown in Table 3, though financial stability has been recognised as a shared responsibility, central banks have been assigned the lead role in most of the countries.", "Even as details of the newly created bodies differ, the thrust is the same, i.e., better co-ordination to gauge systemic risks and plan an appropriate response.", "Furthermore, with increasing sovereign risk concerns in a number of economies, particularly the advanced economies, better policy response is expected as fiscal authorities are also a part of the new institutional framework for financial stability.", "However, even under the more collegial approach to financial stability, policy co-ordination is not going to be so easy, especially when there is a problem of time-inconsistency and the objective functions of the authorities may not always be the same (Praet, 2011).", "It is also important to guard against the risk that active involvement of governments should not bring back fiscal dominance and compromise the autonomy of each regulator and the central bank.", "(iii) Central bank communication In a market-determined system, central banks have placed a greater reliance on transparency and communication to enhance monetary policy transmission and establish accountability to the public for their decision-making.", "So far the experience shows that communication on monetary policy issues has moved from complete secrecy, to constructive ambiguity to transparency.", "For instance, the Fed and the ECB have in recent years frequently provided fairly direct indications about future interest-rate decisions in their official statements.", "We, in the RBI, have also started giving forward guidance since September 2010.", "However, there are several challenges.", "It is not easy to communicate clearly on a single objective.", "Going forward, as central banks broaden their mandates and institutional design grows in complexity, so also will the communication challenges.", "For example, if a central bank were to ease monetary policy on financial stability concerns even when inflation is high, it risks unhinging of inflation expectations, which in turn could complicate financial stability.", "During the recent crisis, there were many instances of communication challenges faced by central banks.", "For instance, the US Fed faced communication challenge with regard to quantitative easing and the exit policy of its unconventional measures.", "We, in the RBI, had to face communication challenge when we reduced cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks in January and March 2012 on liquidity concerns even when inflation was above our tolerance level.", "While some interpreted it as premature reversal of tight monetary policy stance, others saw this as a pure liquidity action not inconsistent with our monetary stance.", "If the policy measures are not properly guided and not understood as intended, they may not transmit the right signal and eventually prove to be a noise to financial market entities.", "Guidance by central banks, at best, could be conditional because of the provisional nature of immediate available information set, limitations of macro models, incomplete knowledge and uncertainties about the evolution of the economy and periodic unanticipated shocks.", "Thus, transparency in communication is a double-edged sword which at times could produce unintended consequences.", "As central banks broaden their objectives so also they have to hone their communication skills.", "To sum up: Financial stability as an objective of central banks has turned a full circle from being the predominant objective, to a virtual neglect to being reinstated recently as an important objective drawing on the lessons of global financial crisis.", "However, financial markets and institutions have grown in complexity making it difficult for a single entity to deliver on financial stability.", "Therefore, financial stability has to be a shared responsibility wherein central banks have a predominant role.", "This necessitates a fresh look at monetary policy framework, institutional design for policy co-ordination and effective communication.", "Moreover, there is a need for explicit recognition of financial stability objective, particularly in the statute of the central bank, to establish an accountability framework.", "While it is not very apparent whether price stability can ensure financial stability, it is clear that price instability could jeopardise financial stability.", "Financial stability objective, therefore, cannot or should not override the price stability objective, which should continue to be the predominant objective of monetary policy.", "Table 3 (cont) Financial Stability
