in financial access.", "Unless we take concerted steps to address some of the challenges, however, the full potential of the opportunities may not be achieved.", "I intend to briefly touch upon some of these issues and challenges in my short remarks today.", "Payments systems are the plumbing of the financial system; so long as there is no leakage or clogging, we are unaware of their functioning.", "But when they do back up, the situation becomes catastrophic quickly.", "The Reserve Bank, as the regulator of payment and settlement systems in the country, develops the necessary regulatory framework, generally through a consultative process, to ensure that different types of payment systems cater to the needs of different segments of society.", "The aim is to ensure easy

mechanisms to be cheap and scalable, so that they are suited to our economy where ticket sizes are small but transaction volumes huge.", "An additional desirable element would be for the different payment systems to be interoperable - or at least be able to talk to each other.", "Fourth, we need systems that offer security even to the unsophisticated user, and do not place a huge burden of care on them.", "This requires greater emphasis on transaction monitoring and identification of suspicious patterns by the system operator, rather than an insistence on ever increasing levels of care by the unsophisticated user.", "And fifth, we need an effective process of consumer redressal that allows speedy and fair resolution of customer complaints.", "So long as customers adhere to a reasonable level of care, residual risks should be absorbed by the operator.", "Some recent developments Let me now describe some of what has been happening in payments and relate back to our desires.", "\u2022

Clearing House (NACH) to which the decentralised system of Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) is also being migrated.", "\u2022 In ensuring the safety and security of transactions to build confidence and trust in electronic payments some of the measures put in place include mandatory online alerts for card transactions, mandatory PIN entry for every transaction at ATM, additional factor of authentication for card transactions, need for entering PIN for even magstripe Debit cards when used at POS (Point of Sale), migration from magstripe to Chip and PIN cards in a phased manner, processing of ATM transactions on chip data when EMV Chip and Pin cards are used, encouraging use of contactless cards using interoperable protocols, etc.", "Merchants who complain about \"dropped\"

Discounting System (TReDS) which ought to be a game-changer for meeting the financing needs of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) segment.", "MSMEs get squeezed all the time by their large buyers, who pay after long delays.", "All would be better off if the MSME could sell its claim on the large buyer in the market.", "The MSME would get its money quickly, while the market would get a claim on the better rated large buyer instead of holding a claim on the MSME.", "All this will happen as the three Trade-Receivables Discounting Systems (TReDS) which the RBI has licensed, start later this financial year.", "The key is to reduce transaction costs by automating almost every aspect of the transaction so that even the smallest MSMEs can benefit.", "With these changes taking place and

and across systems.", "\u2022 Despite the huge potential, activation rates and usage levels of various electronic payment services remain at low levels, though growth is picking up.", "No doubt the fear of taxation as payments move from cash to electronic plays a part in dampening activity.", "As information technology brings down the possible space to avoid or evade tax, and as the benefits, for example in access to credit, of building verifiable histories of transactions increase, I have no doubt that merchants will push more for electronic payments.", "Some tax benefits to those merchants who show increases in digital transactions, and perhaps innovative ways to encourage customer participation, may be beneficial.", "For example, service providers could enter every transaction into a high-payout monthly lottery, with a few lucky customers rewarded every month.", "\u2022 At the same time, we should not rule out the possibility that the reluctance to transact is because of the unknown security consequences and costs of using technology.", "While banks find it more profitable to cater to the requirements of privileged customers, the digital divide should not widen, with more and more digital payment options being designed to serve the requirements of those who already have access to digital, while a large segment of society is left dependent on cash as they are neither aware of the options nor is the infrastructure made accessible at low cost.", "Creating appropriate customer awareness would not only enable the customers to choose their mix of payments taking into account time criticality, security and risk, and the cost involved, but also enable the banks to optimize their payment product mix depending upon their customer profiles.", "\u2022 No technology-based or digital services can be offered without consideration for security of transactions.", "Recently, there have been a spate of frauds (through vishing and phishing) in some segments of payment services.", "Banks have a very high level of responsibility when adopting digital channels - to not only ensure security of the channel at infrastructure level, to protect data
