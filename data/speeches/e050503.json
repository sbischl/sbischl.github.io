local government relationships.", "Similarly, the reforms of Civil Service, Police and judiciary have to be intensified as part of the second generation reforms in the next five years.", "As these are quite tough to implement and cut across many structure and boundaries, a suitable mechanism has to be put in place to manage this process.", "Poverty reduction Reducing poverty is a medium-to-long term phenomenon and it is unrealistic to expect a significant decline in the incidence of poverty in the short term.", "It will take at least another decade to halve it to 16 percent, if appropriate strategy is pursued.", "Therefore, it becomes essential to examine the elements of this strategy and come to a conclusion whether this objective is attainable or not.", "The medium term strategy for poverty reduction enunciated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy paper consists of four elements (a) Accelerated Economic Growth (b) Increased Public Expenditures (c) Poverty Targeted Interventions (d) Social Safety Nets.", "(a) Accelerated economic growth From a low of 1.8 percent GDP growth recorded in 2000-01 the growth rate picked up gradually to 5.5 percent in 2002-03, 6.4 percent in 2003/04 and most likely to reach 7.5 percent this year.", "Therefore the key is to sustain this high rate of economic growth over the next ten years.", "Investment ratios have to rise from the present level of 19 percent to 25 percent by 2009-10 and the productivity of investment has to improve at the same time.", "The drivers of growth identified in the PRSP are agriculture, SMEs, construction and housing, oil and gas and information technology.", "While the first three will certainly accentuate the pro-poor pattern of growth and help in poverty reduction energy, security will be attained from oil and gas exploration and productivity gains from extensive use of I.T.", "(b) Increased public expenditures Agriculture sector growth in Pakistan is highly correlated with availability of water for irrigation.", "The reservoirs built in the 1960s and 1970s have made a huge difference to food security of Pakistan.", "But these reservoirs are getting silted while the requirement for water is on rise.", "Thus public expenditure will give priority to water resource development through new reservoirs, rehabilitation of existing canals and barrages, lining of water courses and conservation of water.", "Public expenditure on education have to be doubled from 2 percent of GDP to 4 percent in the next five years and similarly health, water supply and sanitation will be given higher allocations.", "(c) Poverty targeted interventions Economic growth is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for poverty reduction.", "Where poverty is endemic, high economic growth must be accompanied by direct poverty alleviation measures.", "Towards this end, poverty targeted intervention programs consisting of several major elements are being introduced.", "These elements include: (i) integrated small public works program in both urban and rural areas (Khushal Pakistan Program), and the (ii) development of microfinance sector to help improve credit access of the poor.", "Khushal Pakistan Program had generated economic activity in the country through local public works.", "The provinces, in close collaboration with the local authorities and communities, completed almost half a billion dollars of small projects creating about 1 million job opportunities along with essential infrastructure in rural and low income urban areas.", "The program has resulted in construction of farm-to-market roads, rehabilitation of water supply schemes, repair of existing schools, small rural roads, streets, drains, and storm channels in villages.", "Moreover, the program has been supplemented with the schemes for lining of watercourses and laser land leveling, desilting canals, and provision of civil amenities in towns, municipal committees, and metropolitan corporations.", "The role of microfinance in poverty alleviation and employment generation has been widely accepted.", "The government has established a micro-credit bank (Khushali Bank), as a prototype institution for providing credit access to poor households.", "This bank has so far reached out to 200,000 poor households throughout the country.", "The work of this bank has been reinforced by the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, which through a network of partner organizations in non-governmental sector has reached out to another 300,000 poor families.", "Education and health Pakistan's poor educational outcomes have become a major constraining influence on its quest for integration in the global economy.", "High rates of illiteracy, particularly among women, low educational attainment of the labour force, and lack of qualified technical and scientific manpower have impeded economic growth.", "The strategic thrust of Education Sector Reforms (ESRs) consists of (a) achieving universal primary education and adult literacy; (b) improving the quality of education; (c) renewed focus on technical and vocational education.", "Higher education and Science and technological research capacities are also being bolstered in the country.", "Madarassahs are being brought into the mainstream educational system so that their products can find gainful employment in the economy.", "The National Commission on Human Development is mobilizing community volunteers to bring out-of-the school children into the system.", "Female educational enrolments have jumped in the province of Punjab since the girl students were awarded monthly stipends to support their education.", "The new health policy follows a \"health for all\" approach based on accessibility, affordability and acceptability of health services by the general population.", "The health strategy places greater focus on a continuous shift from curative services to preventive health services by improving the primary health care system.", "Improvements in health status are taking place mainly through maternal and child health, communicable and infectious disease control and elimination of nutrient deficiencies.", "The budget for the Expanded Program of Immunization has been increased and coverage is being expanded in rural areas as well as among women.", "A sound tuberculosis control program, HIV/AIDS program, and antimalaria program are also under implementation.", "The shift of public expenditures from tertiary to primary and secondary health care and devolving and decentralizing financial and administrative powers to local tiers form the crux of the health sector reforms.", "This new approach provides a clear signal that preventive rather than curative health care will be given priority in allocation of expenditures.", "Poor access to water supply and sanitation are often associated with poor health outcomes.", "At present only 63 percent of the country's population has access to safe drinking water, whereas proper sanitation facilities are available to only 39 percent of the total population.", "The government is planning to increase water supply facilities and sanitation facilities to reach 100 percent of population as part of Millennium Development Goal.", "Construction of drinking water supply and sanitation facilities is already receiving prime importance under the Khushal Pakistan Program.", "(d) Social safety nets As part of Social Safety Net Program, the government has launched direct cash-transfer programs for poor families through medical assistance, and educational stipends from the Bait-ul-Maal (a public welfare program).", "The Food Support Program covers 1.2 million of the poorest households with monthly incomes of up to Rs2,000 per family (US$35).", "A system of needs testing has been adopted for the identification of beneficiaries by linking the program with the zakat system.", "The zakat program that targets widows, orphans and the disabled has been strengthened.", "About two million beneficiaries received assistance from the Zakat Fund, of which 0.5 million receive assistance on a regular basis.", "It is envisaged that an additional 1.5 million will be added to the list of zakat recipients through rehabilitation schemes, which will provide micro loans of Rs10,000 (US$160) to Rs50,000 (US$800) each for starting up small businesses.", "An allocation of Rs5 billion (US$80 million) has been made for these schemes in addition to the normal stipends to (the needy) out of the Zakat Fund.", "It is estimated that zakat contributes 10-15 percent to the government's poverty reduction program.", "The school feeding program for female students (Tawana Pakistan Program), which was successfully piloted in a few districts, will be replicated throughout the country.", "This program will help address malnutrition in female students as this has resulted in low enrolment, high absenteeism/dropout rate and low cognitive achievement.", "It is estimated that community mobilization will strengthen ownership of this program and lead to a 30 percent decrease in the dropout rate.", "The Employees Old-age Benefits Institutions (EOBI) and provincial social security institutions provide pension and medical care benefits to private sector employees.", "Sindh and Punjab provide medical care benefits to about 700,000 beneficiaries and their dependents.", "The Workers Welfare Fund also provides support to workers and their families.", "Assessment and conclusion 3.1 Assessment In making the assessment of the last five years.", "I will address two questions that are uppermost on the minds of most Pakistanis within or outside the country.", "The first question that arises in the discussion of Pakistan's economic turnaround is as to how much of this can be attributed to the favourable external environment created as a result of 9-11 and how much is due to better economic management.", "My own assessment of the situation is that while the favourable external environment has definitely helped and reinforced the thrust of the economic policies and reforms, its impact would have been short lived and transitory in absence of the reforms and policies and improvement in governance that have been undertaken during the last five and a half years.", "The macroeconomic indicators had started looking good even before Sept. 11 but the removal of sanctions, resumption of assistance, and diversion of remittances through the banking channels did definitely provide an impetus.", "I would argue that the reprofiling of Paris Club Debt would have taken place in any event as the IMF had agreed on the three-year PRGF and debt reprofiling upon the successful completion of the 9-month Stand-by Program before Sept. 11.", "It should be kept in mind that the impact of Sept. 11 upon the Pakistan's economy has not been, by any means, an unmitigated blessing.", "Export orders were cancelled and export target for that year was missed by $1 billion.", "Shipping freights and insurance premia were raised substantially, foreign investors and buyers stopped visiting Pakistan and the fledgling I.T.", "industry suffered a severe set back.", "Some of the consequences of that shock are still lingering on in form of a negative perception of Pakistan in the Western media.", "The quantum of assistance from the U.S. accruing to Pakistan does not form a significant proportion of our foreign exchange receipts.", "If we combine all the bilateral official flows from the U.S. they do not, on average, exceed $1 billion annually.", "Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings will amount to $25 billion this year.", "Thus, contrary to the popular belief that Pakistan's economy will collapse if the U.S. withdraws its official assistance, the truth of the matter is that the amounts involved are too insignificant.", "What we really need from the U.S. is better market access to our exports on the same terms as allowed to the Central American, Caribbean and African States.", "Pakistan can earn twice as much as it will receive in official assistance from the U.S., if this market access is allowed.", "The second popular view that is commonly prevalent is that we do not have independent economic policies and that we follow the policies dictated to us by the IMF and the World Bank.", "It is true that when we needed the IMF's assistance to reprofile our Paris Club Debt we had no choice at that time but to comply with the conditionalities set by them.", "But once we had achieved that objective and had set our own house in order, it was no longer necessary to agree to all their conditionalities.", "We did agree and implement those which were beneficial to our own interests.", "Most of the policies prescribed by them e.g.", "fiscal discipline, mobilizing tax revenues, removing tariff barriers, privatizing public enterprises, maintaining low inflation, etc.", "all make perfect sense and no economist in his right mind could take an issue with them.", "Where the shoe pinches is that these policies are reduced to quantifiable targets and performance criteria for each quarter and for any slippages or deviations, however, legitimate they may be during that particular quarter, the country is penalized and its reputation is put in jeopardy.", "This sort of micromanagement is resented by the economic managers of the developing countries.", "I would argue that as long as the country is moving on the right path in implementing the desirable set of reforms, the speed, phasing and sequencing should be left to the economic managers and not controlled by the IMF.", "As you are all aware that we have said good-bye to the IMF since September 2004 and did not draw down the last two tranches to which we were entitled to on the basis of our performance.", "In the past, if we were confronted with the oil price shock that we are facing today, we would have certainly run to the IMF for balance of payments support and enter into a program.", "But, the resilience of our economy has been tested in the wake of this large oil price increase and we have been able to maintain a stable exchange rate, high reserve accumulation and low external debt ratios.", "Going forward, Pakistan is faced with several major challenges.", "In the short term, as the inflationary pressures have become quite intense in the last 9 months, serious efforts have to be made to bring inflation under control.", "The poor, vulnerable and fixed income groups are the worst affected by this menace.", "On the demand side, monetary policy is being tightened and interest rates have been raised.", "On the supply side, the new wheat crop should be able to quell the food inflation.", "There is still great uncertainty about oil prices.", "If they start receding from the peak levels this will have a favourable effect on the general price level and help in moderating inflationary expectations in the coming months.", "The other challenge is the management of balance of payments situation.", "As imports of machinery and equipment along with the higher oil bill have pushed the level of imports, trade deficit has widened.", "So far, increased flow of workers' remittances, foreign direct investment and other concessional flows have been able to finance this deficit but, in the long run, widening of our export base, penetration in new markets and increasing the productivity of textile exports are the only safe ways to minimize trade imbalances.", "Pakistan's Tax-GDP ratio has remained stagnant at low levels and the tax net is limited to 1.1 million tax payers of which 0.45 million are salaried workers.", "Thus, the dependence on regressive indirect taxes has created a disproportionately high burden on the middle and lower income groups.", "Tax reforms underway should aim to increase the buoyancy and elasticity of the tax system.", "The biggest problem that has retarded equitable growth in Pakistan has been low investment in human development, particularly the female education.", "More recently the active participation of private and non-governmental sector has given rise to some hope that quality of education will improve.", "But the critical question of access to education by the poor quintiles still has not been satisfactorily addressed.", "Government has the responsibility to finance the poor households' education and health needs but it can provide these services through other providers rather than itself.", "As the economy moves on the path of 7 to 8 percent sustained growth over the next decade, the shortages, congestion and inadequacy of physical infrastructure will become quite apparent.", "Under the given fiscal envelope the public sector development program can only finance one half of the annual requirements.", "The other half has to come through the private sector or privatepublic partnership.", "For the latter, we have to work out contractual arrangements whereby the end users can easily afford to pay the cost of these services.", "Finally and the most important bottleneck, in my view, is the way of rapid economic growth and poverty reduction will be the lack of capacity of Civil Service, Police and Judiciary to function as effective institutions in implementing the policies and programs, treating the citizens equitably and with respect and redressing their grievances in a just manner.", "The politicization of these institutions has ingrained an attitude of risk aversion and apathy, an instinct of survival and an indifference towards competence and merit.", "Unless comprehensive reforms of these institutions are undertaken, we will have serious difficulty in maintaining the speed of growth and spreading its benefits to the poor.", ".2 Conclusion Pakistan has achieved macroeconomic stability, introduced structural reforms, improved economic governance and resumed the path for high growth rates.", "But there is no room for complacency as we are confronted with challenges of poverty reduction, employment generation, balanced regional growth, upgrading social indicators and containing inflation.", "The second generation reforms aimed at strengthening the country's institutions and their capacity to deliver basic services along with the continuation of sound and consistent economic policy and investment in human development and infrastructure will be able to steer the country on the right course."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none",
