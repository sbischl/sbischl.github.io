target and to mitigate the effects of the global downturn on the Norwegian economy.", "The interest reduction brought the real interest rate down to a level far below normal.", "At the same time, households and firms could remain confident that the expansionary monetary stance would not contribute to price and wage spirals in the longer term.", "In Norway, various measures of underlying inflation have been close to 2.5 per cent in recent months.", "Lower wage growth, reduced capacity utilisation and low global inflation have counterbalanced the effects of higher energy prices and the

point towards the end of the year with a view to maintaining inflation at 2.5 per cent over time.", "New information suggests that the recovery in the Norwegian economy is continuing, but that capacity utilisation is probably somewhat lower than anticipated in autumn 2009.", "Combined with lower interest rates abroad, a stronger krone and lower wage growth suggest that the interest rate forecast should be revised down somewhat in relation to the October Report.", "Interest rates in Norway are low.", "The effect on private consumption of the substantial interest rate cuts in 2008 and 2009 has probably not been exhausted and high consumption growth is expected to continue in 2010.", "The new guidelines for prudent residential mortgage lending issued by Finanstilsynet (the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway) may curb household debt accumulation.", "Over time, household borrowing may nevertheless increase considerably and saving may fall.", "The aim of guarding against the risk of future imbalances, which may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead, suggests that the interest rate should be gradually brought closer to a more normal level.", "On the other hand, a marked interest rate increase in Norway and a wider interest rate differential between Norway and other countries may entail a risk of a considerably strongerthan-projected krone, resulting in inflation that is too low.", "This will make it difficult to bring inflation up to target within a reasonable time horizon.", "A strong krone may also lead to lower activity in exposed industries and thereby lower capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy.", "This suggests that the interest rate should not be raised too rapidly.", "Monetary policy cannot fine-tune developments in the economy, but it can mitigate the most severe effects when the economy is exposed to shocks.", "Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks suggest that the key rate should be gradually increased ahead, although somewhat later than we envisaged in October 2009.", "On 24 March, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 11\u20442-21\u20442 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 23 June 2010 unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.", "The interest rate was kept unchanged at this meeting.", "This is based on the assessment that inflation and capacity utilisation may for a period be slightly lower than previously projected and that the interest rate should be increased somewhat later than expected in autumn 2009."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
