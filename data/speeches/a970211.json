"Representatives from various countries will have the opportunity to witness the realisation of the principle of \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong.", "I believe that nobody will wish to miss such an opportunity.", "Mr Tsang has just expressed his views on the economy of Hong Kong before and after 1997.", "I would like to say a few words from the perspective of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).", "I have stated on many occasions that we are confident that after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the territory will not only remain prosperous and stable, but its status as an international financial centre will also be further enhanced.", "And I have good reasons for this confidence.", "First, there are the strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong and the entrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong.", "These form the basis for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability and for maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.", "As you all know, Hong Kong is an international trade, transport, financial and information centre.", "With the rapid economic developments taking place in the Asia-Pacific region,

status as an international financial centre, its monetary and financial policies, the status of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements, capital movements and the role of the Exchange Fund.", "These principles establish the basic monetary relationship between China and Hong Kong under the principle of \"one country, two systems\", and this can conveniently be summarised as \"one country, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities\" within a sovereign state.", "It should be pointed out that the co-existence of two currencies, that is, the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi, is a clear demonstration of the differences between the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland.", "It is therefore essential that the two monetary systems should be mutually independent.", "The renminbi will not replace the Hong Kong dollar.", "We are of the view that the co-existence of two monetary systems is significant to the economic reform of China.", "It follows

continuity and further strengthening of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.", "Economic development in the mainland provides a strong support to Hong Kong's economic development.", "China is confident in Hong Kong's maintaining prosperity and stability after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economic development in China.", "China is firmly committed to continuing with its

position.", "Therefore the exchange rate of the renminbi, which is determined by the market, will remain stable.", "The renminbi, for all intents and purposes has become fully convertible in the current account.", "We are in advance of our schedule in satisfying the requirement stipulated in Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement.", "In the next five years, China will continue to adopt an appropriately tight monetary policy.", "The adoption of this policy means firstly, we will have an appropriately tight monetary stance to keep inflation at a level lower than the rate of economic growth.", "Secondly, money supply should grow at an appropriate level.", "Thirdly, reforms and improvements will continuously be made to the approach in making macro-economic adjustment.", "That is, we will move from reliance on direct control of the volume of credit towards regulating money supply by means of indirect monetary policy instruments such as reserve requirements, open market operations and interest rate policy.", "Appropriately tight monetary policy is not limited to the control of total credit but also adjustment of the credit structure, deepening of monetary reforms, and timely adjustments to the different aspects of the monetary system.", "An appropriately tight monetary policy is conducive to the healthy, stable and sustained growth of the national economy.", "It also helps to create favourable conditions for the resumption of sovereignty and the continued prosperity of Hong Kong.", "Stability in China is the very basis for Hong Kong's stability while Hong Kong's stability will certainly enhance economic reform and developments in China.", "Foreign investors in Hong Kong will, at the same time, benefit from the stability of China and Hong Kong.", "Those sceptics who have doubted China's commitment to the open door policy no longer can have such doubts after witnessing the implementation of our economic reforms and its achievements.", "I hope you will recognise that China is firmly committed to implementing the principle of \"one country, two systems\" and maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, just as we have been firmly committed to the implementation of economic reform in China.", "The principle of \"one country, two systems\" is the realisation of the spirit of our constitution and has become a long-term irreversible national policy.", "As China continues to pursue its economic reform, Hong Kong's role as the international financial centre in China will become more and more important.", "We will do our best to

Kong's prosperity and stability.", "Ladies and gentlemen, when you come to next year's Annual Meetings in Hong Kong, you will all see for yourselves the realisation of the principle of \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong.", "In addition, I believe that the 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings will be an impressive event as a result."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none",
