the ECB - is the only institution in Europe that can have a material influence on developments across the continent in the short term.", "The ECB is keeping government debt yields low by means of record-low policy rates and large government bond purchases.", "This is keeping the wheels in motion.", "It is also supporting government finances in a number of European countries.", "In today's situation, private investors would probably have required considerably higher yields on sovereign bonds - as was the case in 2011 and 2012 - if they did not know that the ECB was buying large volumes of these bonds.", "No treatment is without side-effects.", "The same goes for low interest rates: there is little incentive to reduce debt and measures that could have strengthened government budgets can be postponed.", "Firms that are not making money can continue to operate.", "Monetary policy in Europe has been stretched to its limits.", "What monetary policy can do is to build a bridge -
