which is, let me repeat, very welcome in Paris - but not at the cost of less regulation, which would - as we have seen elsewhere - work against the interests of the players themselves.", "Digitalisation of currency and payments: illustration of innovation partnership approach This brings me to the more forward-looking recipe, which provides a second insight into the dynamic interdependence between regulation and innovation, and between the public and private sector.", "Private innovation is both crucial and irreplaceable but central banks also have creative DNA, and many innovations are deployed within a partnership framework.", "Money is a perfect illustration.", "For centuries, the coexistence of central bank and commercial bank money has structured the retail payment landscape.", "We can all physically pay with central bank money, using cash, or with commercial bank money, using non-cash payment instruments such as cards.", "However, the rapid digitalisation of payments is leading to a rethink: as we become fully digital societies, should central bank currency be the only thing to remain in paper format?", "I imagine that two centuries ago, certain people had major doubts about issuing banknotes -
