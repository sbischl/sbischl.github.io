their first job, how much and what kind of an educational investment to make, how to finance that investment, whether to strike out on their own, and whether to rent or buy a home - can have a lasting effect on their subsequent financial security and the economic foundation they provide for their children.", "There are times, however, when larger forces materially interrupt or impede the individual efforts of young people to build a better economic life.", "The Great Depression left an indelible imprint on the generation that came of age in that era, influencing their subsequent job trajectories and attitudes toward risk and investment.", "The question we face today is whether the Great Recession may similarly leave a lasting mark on the many Americans who came of age in its shadow.", "It is important to understand the headwinds encountered by the Great Recession generation as they navigated a daunting job market, and the lessons they have taken from the crisis, particularly with respect to investments in education and housing.", "And it is important to identify what actions can be taken to improve economic outcomes for the Great Recession generation, as their experiences will powerfully influence not just growth today, but also the contours of opportunity faced by their children.", "Employment and participation in the labor force Let's start by considering what it was like to graduate from high school or college in June 2009.", "The overall unemployment rate stood at 9.5 percent, and employers slashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th month in a row of job cuts.", "For young people, job prospects were even bleaker.", "Nearly one-fourth of teenagers in the labor force were unemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood at 15.2 percent.", "Young African Americans and Hispanics experienced higher rates of unemployment than their white peers.", "Even these painfully high unemployment rates - the highest since the early 1980s - understate the damage caused by the Great Recession to young people's work lives.", "The lack of job opportunities appears to have caused many young people to become so discouraged that they dropped out of the labor force altogether, exacerbating a downtrend and driving labor force participation among young people to historical lows.", "Even for those who remained in the labor force and have been fortunate to find work, compensation prospects have been poor.", "For example, inflation-adjusted full-time weekly earnings among 19- to 24-year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about 5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1 Of those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low wages, but also many are working at jobs for which they are overqualified.", "A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that employers responded to the slack labor market by increasing the educational requirements or the number of years of experience required for new hires, which likely froze out many from the labor pool and resulted in the underemployment of others.", "In 2012, roughly 45 percent of college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one-third relative to 2001 and the highest underemployment rate since the early 1990s.", "Moreover, a recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the Great Recession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career.", "Recently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve, with the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds falling about one-third relative to its peak and inflation-adjusted earnings starting to rise.", "Nevertheless, even with this recent improvement, there is a risk that the high rates of unemployment, low labor force attachment, and stagnant wages experienced by those who have come of age in the years surrounding the Great Recession may have long-lasting consequences.", "A number of studies have found that graduating from college during a recession can have a lasting effect.", "If past studies hold true today, the employment rate of those graduating from college during the Great Recession may recover relatively soon, but their earnings may be reduced for up to a decade or longer as this cohort initially secures lower-quality jobs and then only gradually works its way back up to the normal earnings trajectory.", "To the extent that these lost earnings translate into reductions in lifetime resources, they could affect life-cycle spending and investment decisions, topics that I will turn to next.", "Education and student debt Enrollment in colleges and graduate schools increased sharply during the Great Recession.", "With skyrocketing youth unemployment and compensation under pressure, the recession sharply reduced the opportunity costs of additional years of schooling.", "For many, these additional educational investments are likely to be beneficial.", "Investing in additional education is a classic way of mitigating the negative effects of graduating in a recession, and empirical research suggests that the lifetime returns to completing a college degree are substantial on average.", "the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and are adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board's staff to constant 2009 dollars using the personal consumption expenditures index.", "See Alicia Sasser Modestino, Daniel Shoag, and Joshua Ballance (2015), \"Upskilling: Do Employers Demand Greater Skill When Skilled Workers Are Plentiful?\"", "Working Paper Series 14-17 (Boston: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, January).", "See Jaison R.
