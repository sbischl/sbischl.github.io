Wilkins Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada McGill University Max Bell School of Public Policy November 20, 2018 Montre\u0301al, Quebec Choosing the Best Monetary Policy Framework for Canada \"WHEREAS it is desirable to establish a central bank in Canada to regulate credit and currency in the interests of the economic life of the nation, to control and protect the external value of the national monetary unit and to mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade, prices, and employment, so far as may be possible within the scope of monetary action, and generally to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada...\" Bank of Canada Act It is a pleasure to speak here at the Max Bell School of Public Policy.", "As many of you know, Bell was a shrewd business person and media mogul during an era that witnessed the Great Depression, the Second World War and Canada joining the world stage.", "He was also dedicated to public affairs and the greater good of Canadians.", "It is therefore fitting that I am here today to add to a conversation about the best monetary policy framework for Canada.", "The Bank of Canada opened its doors during era, in 1935, to support the economic and financial welfare of Canada.", "What that has meant in practice has naturally changed quite a lot over the years to keep up with a complex and evolving world.", "Bank's monetary policy framework For the last quarter of a century, the has been focused on targeting low and stable inflation, in the context of a flexible exchange Bank's goal, it is rate.", "This is not just the shared with the federal government- both acting on behalf of the people of Canada.", "This is formalized in what is called the inflation-control agreement.", "It is renewed every five years and has been supported by six prime ministers of different partisan stripes.", "We are working on the next renewal, set for 2021, with our Finance colleagues.", "Having a formal agreement with a democratically elected government supports the credibility of our shared objective.", "It gives the Bank the independence it needs to pursue that objective.", "The Bank has used this independence wisely.", "We have delivered low and stable inflation-pretty darn close to our target of 2 per cent on average over the last 25 years.", "We have managed to do this even in the face of big economic shocks, such as the run-up of oil prices in the mid-2000s and the plunge four years ago, and the global financial crisis in between.", "Yet even a well-functioning monetary policy framework deserves an openminded discussion, particularly in the post-crisis world we live in.", "There are a couple of challenges facing our framework that mean it may not serve the economic and financial welfare of Canada in the future as well as it has in the past.", "The objectives that we set and how we go about achieving them have real implications for people in their everyday lives.", "This could not be more obvious than it is today, as interest rates rise to more normal levels.", "This is resulting in difficult adjustments in the finances of many.", "At the same time, the Bank's actions are supporting a stable economic environment for even more households.", "My remarks today are intended to spark a good discussion.", "I will focus on two public policy questions that are shaping our work plan leading up to the 2021 1.", "What alternative frameworks might do a better job than inflation targeting, if any?", "We know there are contenders, but we have not conducted a full horse race since the 1980s.", "Regardless of whether we stick with inflation targeting or move to something new, what supporting policies can we bring to the table?", "We Bank of Canada's policy know the toolkit, along with other public policies, are critical to reinforcing our shared objectives.", "Our research work will drill down in these areas, and will be informed by extensive engagement outside the Bank.", "Our annual economic conference this year, held a couple of weeks ago, was on this subject and yielded a very productive debate.", "And, our research is being published as we go, so Canadians can follow our progress.", "What are the main challenges for inflation targeting?", "Let us remind ourselves what we are trying to achieve with our current monetary policy objective of 2 per cent inflation.", "The most obvious answer is low, stable and predictable inflation.", "In previous eras, episodes of runaway inflation in this country and others led to major recessions and years of stagnant growth.", "Yet pursuing this objective achieves more than just price stability \"a nominal anchor\" as economists call it: it steadies the economy at the same time.", "Stabilizing purchasing power makes it easier to plan personal finances and business investments.", "It also helps smooth the economic swings that result in job losses and financial stress.", "Despite these virtues, there are a couple of challenges linked to how we currently do business that have grown in importance since the crisis.", "These were front and centre of discussions at our annual conference.", "One challenge is that the central bank is more likely to run out of conventional firepower in the event of an economic downturn.", "By that I mean the ability to lower the policy rate.", "The reason for this is straightforward.", "Our estimate of the nominal neutral rate of interest-where monetary policy is neither stimulative nor restrictive-is currently in the 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 per cent range.", "This is about 2 percentage points lower than in the early 2000s.", "Our policy rate cannot be set much below zero, so there is now a lot less room to lower interest rates in response to events that drag the economy down.", "Estimates for Canada show that the probability of the Bank facing this challenge is now about 13 per cent, instead of about 3 per cent when the neutral rate was higher.", "There are unconventional policy tools that could be deployed in this situation if needed, although as I will explain later, we still have much to learn about their effectiveness.", "A second challenge is that the lower neutral rate may encourage households and investors to take on excessive risk.", "This leaves the economy exposed to boom- Bank of Canada research shows the policy rate could be lowered to -0.5 per cent if warranted, meaning the lower bound would be below zero.", "However, we consider a policy rate below zero to be in the unconventional policy space.", "For more detail, see J. Witmer and J. Yang, \"Estimating Canada's Effective Lower Bank of Canada Review Bound,\" (Spring 2016): 3-14.", "See X. Chen and J. Dorich, Bank of Canada \"The Neutral Rate in Canada: 2018 Estimates,\" Staff Analytical Note No.", "These estimates are based on simulations using the Terms-of-Trade Economic Model (ToTEM), the Bank's main policy model.", "The simulation results assume an effective lower bound of -0.5 per cent and the same distribution of shocks as observed over the 1995Q1-2015Q4 sample.", "See Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, December 2015) and S. S. Poloz, \"Prudent Preparation: The Evolution of (remarks to the Empire Club of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Unconventional Monetary Policies\" December 8, 2015).", "It is a difficult problem, since monetary policy is ill-suited to dealing with this.", "I will speak later about other tools that can be more effective.", "My bottom line here is that although our inflation-targeting framework has served us very well, we should look for ways to improve it.", "What might do a better job?", "This leads me to my first question: what other framework might do a better job?", "The Bank of Canada is not alone in this line of inquiry.", "In fact, many influential economists have urged us and other central banks to consider alternatives.", "There are many out there, but the most popular ideas these days are (i) raising the inflation target, (ii) targeting a path for prices or nominal income, or (iii) adding full employment to our objectives.", "The Bank considered many of these alternatives as part of past renewal processes.", "Yet we have not conducted a thorough side-by-side review of the main options since the original agreement was struck in 1991.", "It is time that we do so.", "We need to be as clear as possible about the criteria we will apply in our assessment.", "My list of the most critical considerations in the post-crisis era are: First, the framework needs to focus only on objectives that monetary policy can actually achieve.", "In the long run, monetary policy can only affect prices-this is what economists refer to as the long-run neutrality of monetary policy.", "What this implies is that monetary policy ultimately cannot resolve underlying, structural issues, such as long-term competitiveness or the quality of jobs.", "It must therefore focus on shorter-term stabilization objectives that help address cyclical issues affecting the economy.", "In other words, objectives that smooth the business cycle.", "These need to be clear and measurable, so that the public can plan accordingly and the central bank can be held accountable.", "A case in point: the clarity and simplicity of our inflation-targeting mandate has underpinned its success.", "Second, the framework needs to support the well-being of Canadians-what I like to call the greater good.", "This requires looking at more than how well a R.
