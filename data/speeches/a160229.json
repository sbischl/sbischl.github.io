leading some to claim central banks are out of monetary ammunition.", "This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.", "A set of powerful forces, both secular and cyclical, have depressed 'equilibrium' interest rates globally.", "These forces include demographic change, slower potential growth, higher credit spreads, lower desired investment, a lower relative price of capital, greater income inequality, sustained private deleveraging and lower public investment.", "Together these dynamics have raised desired savings and lowered desired investment.", "With more savings chasing fewer investment opportunities, equilibrium safe returns have fallen sharply towards zero (Chart 8 - see also Annex).", "Colleagues at the Bank of England estimate that these factors can explain around 400 of the 450 basis points fall in global longterm equilibrium rates since the 1980s.", "The persistence of many of these trends suggests that the global neutral real rate could settle around 1% over the medium to long term.", "Secular drivers pushing down on rates Why does that matter?", "Central banks must set their policy rates with regard to equilibrium interest rates in order to maintain demand growth in line with supply growth and to stabilise inflation.", "Setting real interest rates substantially above the equilibrium rate would, in time, generate rising unemployment and falling prices.", "The opposite is true of setting rates substantially below the equilibrium rate.", "The substantial variance of the equilibrium rate over time means that a 4% policy rate would have been highly stimulative in 1980 but would be highly contractionary today.", "At the onset of the crisis, as households and firms sought to de-lever, the equilibrium rate fell sharply, calling for reductions of conventional policy rates to unprecedented levels.", "The necessary easing, however, went well beyond what central banks could deliver with short rates alone.", "Unconventional monetary policy measures, including large-scale purchases of government securities, were necessary to deliver effective market rates negative enough to mitigate globally deficient demand.", "In the UK, forward guidance supplemented such measures, ensuring households and firms could be confident that interest rates would not be raised prematurely, helping to secure the nascent recovery.", "Central banks have also purchased other assets - in some cases using small-scale programmes to alleviate specific cases of market dysfunction, and, in others, larger ones to inject greater stimulus into the economy.", "By deploying a broad range of ammunition, the economy has been stimulated through a number of channels.", "Lower policy rates brought forward consumption to today from spending tomorrow - the real interest rate channel.", "The all-in costs of borrowing were lowered, boosting existing borrowers' spending power - the cash flow channel.", "And lower funding costs for banks increased the availability of credit - the credit channel.", "Lower discount rates and portfolio balance effects supported asset prices - the wealth channel.", "Currencies' values fell, boosting competitiveness - the exchange rate channel.", "And determined central bank action and forward guidance put a floor under inflation expectations and bolstered sentiment - the confidence channel.", "In this way, central bank actions combatted the worst global downturn since the Great Depression.", "All of these tools, and many variants of them, are still available to central banks if needed.", "With their arsenal well-stocked, the real questions for global reflation are how best to deploy these weapons and whether they will be reinforced by other policies.", "Low interest real rates have bought time by bringing forward demand to today from tomorrow.", "But, to paraphrase my predecessor, Lord King, having brought forward demand for years, tomorrow is now yesterday (and he said that three years ago!).", "In other words, most central banks need the other channels of monetary policy to work harder.", "The scale of unconventional measures is impressive.", "Asset purchase programmes have been extended, notably in the euro area and in Japan.", "The largest four central banks bought assets worth $1.2 trillion in 2015, similar to the amounts purchased post-Lehman and during the 2013 euro-area crisis.", "Adjusting for lower government debt issuance, that leaves an unprecedented flow of net QE, with only $400bn of additional government debt sold to the private sector, compared to $3 trillion in 2010 (Chart 9).", "Converted into US dollar terms using end year exchange rates.", "That volume has likely pushed down on the term premia demanded by investors when they lend at long maturities to G4 governments, reducing the cost of borrowing for firms and households (Chart 10).", "In this regard, QE works through the

unless an improvement in fundamentals boosts the underlying cash flows of these assets, real valuations will fall back.", "That structural policies have not boosted real growth sufficiently is a better justification for the re-pricing in risk markets than any loss of confidence in the power of central banks.", "Central bank innovation has now extended to negative rates, with around a quarter of global output produced in economies where policy rates are literally through the floor.", "Conceptually the more that effective policy rates can be reduced below equilibrium rates, the better the prospects for demand to grow faster than potential supply, promoting global reflation.", "However, it is critical that stimulus measures are structured to boost domestic demand, particularly from sectors of the economy with healthy balance sheets.", "There are limits to the extent to which negative rates can achieve this.", "For example, banks might not pass negative policy rates fully through to their retail customers, shutting off the cash flow and credit channels and thereby limiting the boost to domestic demand.", "That is associated with a commonly expressed concern that negative rates reduce banks' profitability.", "To be clear, monetary policy is conducted to achieve price stability not for the benefit of bank shareholders.", "Nonetheless, when negative rates are implemented in ways that insulate retail customers, shutting off the cash flow and other channels that mainly affect domestic demand, while allowing wholesale rates to adjust, their main effect is through the exchange rate channel.", "From an individual country's perspective this might be an attractive route to boost activity.", "But for the world as a whole, this export of excess saving and transfer of demand weakness elsewhere is ultimately a zero sum game.", "Moreover, to the extent it pushes greater savings onto the global markets, global short-term equilibrium rates would fall further, pulling the global economy closer to a liquidity trap.", "At the global zero bound, there is no free lunch.", "For monetary easing to work at a global level it cannot rely on simply moving scarce demand from one country to another.", "Instead policy needs to increase primarily domestic demand, with the exchange-rate channel more a side effect that accompanies any monetary policy action.", "In any given country, a monetary expansion aimed at boosting domestic demand will tend to reduce effective interest rates9 relative to their equilibrium level, generating an excess of domestic investment over domestic saving that must be met with a capital inflow from abroad.", "But viewed from overseas, the corresponding capital outflow will tend to raise the short-term equilibrium rate (Chart 12), giving conventional monetary policy overseas more traction.", "In this way, the rising tide of global demand would raise all boats.", "Smaller domestic current account (CA) surplus lifts all boats Wider policy implications Ultimately, for monetary policy at the zero lower bound to bridge to a better equilibrium, it must be reinforced by other policies.", "That is, the low interest rate environment puts a premium on domestic and international policy coordination.", "For example, lower interest rates create space for fiscal policy to boost domestic demand directly, should it be necessary, by lowering the financing cost faced by governments.", "And it doesn't take a genius to recognise that a prolonged period of low interest rates can lead to a build-up of vulnerabilities which could derail an expansion and deepen a subsequent recession.", "This means macroprudential policy has an increasingly important role.", "Rightly, the Chinese G20 Presidency has called for G20 members to learn from each other's experience of macroprudential management.", "The IMF, FSB and BIS will therefore report to G20 Leaders ahead of the Hangzhou Summit regarding processes to analyse systemic risks; toolkits to address vulnerabilities; and mechanisms for domestic and international coordination.", "In an increasingly integrated global financial system, this work can help identify areas where we need to work together to keep our systems resilient.", "It is clear, for example, that strong links exists between asset management in advanced economies and the debt markets relied upon by emerging market corporates.", "Where appropriate, the FSB will make policy recommendations regarding structural vulnerabilities associated with asset management activities for public consultation before the Hangzhou Summit.", "And reinforced by recent experience, the FSB's second annual report on the effects of reforms will include a comprehensive review of the extent, drivers and likely persistence of any reduction in market liquidity.", "Whither the G20 Plan for strong, sustainable, balanced growth?", "Most fundamentally, the G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies.", "Gradualism in structural reforms may be promoting disinflationary expectations, while sapping the political process of its mandate.", "The weakness of investment not only holds back the supply side but also weighs on the equilibrium interest rate and further burdens monetary policy.", "At the Brisbane summit in 2014, the G20 leaders agreed an ambitious goal to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least two per cent by 2018.", "But only eighteen months on, the 2 in 5 commitments are starting to look more like the 5/2 diet.", "Less than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered.", "Moreover, whilst implementation has lagged, the need to boost growth

to a better future.", "That future needs the arms of macro policy to operate in close concert, domestically and internationally.", "Demand stimulus alone will not sustainably reflate the global economy.", "Moreover, sustained low rates could strain the capacities of macroprudential policies.", "At their roots, fiscal, monetary, financial and structural policies are deeply complementary, operating through many of the same channels.", "A stronger financial system can better channel savings to investment, building demand in the short run and productivity in the long run.", "Monetary
