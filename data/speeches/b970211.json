financial relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong after 1997 As China and Hong Kong have different currencies and financial systems, people from Hong Kong as well as the international community are very much concerned with how the principle of \"one country, two systems\" can be implemented as regards financial issues.", "It is because the implementation of this principle has direct bearings on the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong as well as the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.", "\"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\" lays down specific provisions relating to Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, its monetary and financial policies, the status of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements, capital flows and the role of the Exchange Fund.", "Our national leaders have reiterated on different occasions that the People's Bank of China, which is the

seminar which was held in September this year.", "Both the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have been offered membership in the Bank for International Settlements.",

own system of currency issuance and management after 1997.", "The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender in Hong Kong and the mainland respectively.", "Hong Kong's existing note-issuing arrangements will remain unchanged.", "Moreover, China supports Hong Kong's commitment to the maintenance of the linked exchange rate system.", "It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities, i.e.", "the People's Bank of China and the HKMA, will also be mutually independent.", "The HKMA will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong Government.", "The People's Bank of China will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any office in Hong Kong.", "The People's Bank of China will strengthen further its present sound co-operation with the HKMA.", "The HKMA has made great contributions to the stability of the local currency and the supervision of financial institutions.", "Such

an international financial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations and participate in the activities of international and regional financial institutions.", "There are therefore provisions in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that Hong Kong may, on its own, maintain and develop financial relations with other countries, regions and relevant international organisations after 1997.", "The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meeting will be held in Hong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.", "This is a magnificent financial event and I am confident that it will be successful.", "III The strengthening of financial co-operation and the promotion of economic prosperity and stability between the mainland and Hong

efforts to maintain Hong Kong's financial stability.", "Secondly, the two places should work closely together to maintain and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.", "Hong Kong has some unique competitive advantages in being an international financial centre in a number of aspects such as opportunities, geographic location and people.", "I have made it clear to the international financial community on many occasions that after China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre will not be undermined but, rather, it will be further strengthened.", "This is because the many unique advantages which Hong Kong enjoys now will continue to exist after 1997.", "There is also the Basic Law which guarantees that Hong Kong will remain unchanged.", "More importantly, with the sustained, rapid and healthy growth of the economy in China - the vast hinterland at the back of Hong Kong - numerous opportunities will be created for Hong Kong's financial sector.", "All these are favourable conditions for the maintenance and strengthening of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.", "Economic developments in the mainland have given rise to strong demand for funds and Hong Kong will continue to be our major funding centre.", "We will strengthen our coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong in areas such as the development of markets and infrastructures in response to the needs of financial developments in both places.", "I have met with many central bankers and major international bankers and they all agreed that Hong Kong should be able to maintain its status as an international financial centre as regards the future relationship between Hong Kong and Shanghai.", "I think as a national economic centre, Shanghai's financial status will become increasingly important.", "However, it will not be possible for Shanghai to become an international financial centre in the longer term and it will not replace Hong Kong.", "Thirdly, the mainland and Hong Kong should co-operate fully with each other so as to promote prosperity and stability.",

primary listing in Hong Kong.", "The volume of import and export trade between the two places amounted to US$ 44.6 billion last year, accounting for 15.9% of China's total external trade.", "If Hong Kong's entrepo\u0302t trade which came from China is also taken into account, the figure reached US$ 124.1 billion, accounting for 34.1% of Hong Kong's total external trade in that year.", "The number of mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong is on the rise and vice versa.", "These institutions are going to provide a whole range of financial services which are conducive to the continuous and stable development of the economic relationship between the two places.", "China will further open up its financial markets.", "This includes the opening up of more districts, the gradual relaxation of renminbi business and the gradual introduction of the investment banking mechanism.", "The Hong Kong financial sector will directly benefit from these moves since they will offer numerous business opportunities.", "In the course of stepping up our pace of financial reforms, we have to keep on learning from advanced international management experience and to provide training to outstanding personnel.", "We hope that the financial community in Hong Kong will provide us with assistance and support in these areas.", "Before ending my speech, I would like to point out that the Hong Kong
