on the contrary, given that foreign-born and native workers have different skill sets, their respective labour services are often found to be complementary.", "The positive contribution to labour market participation of some demographic factors is likely to slow in the future.", "Notably, the baby-boom bulge in the age structure, which for a long time has sustained the share of working-age population, is now starting to push up the share of retirees.", "For given retirement rules, ageing reduces the participation rate.", "According to the European Commission,4 however, the share of active individuals aged 20-64 will still increase by 3 percentage points between 2016 and 2070, owing in part to increases in the statutory retirement age in many countries.", "Future trends in migration are exceedingly difficult to predict.", "Migration pressures are likely to increase, as more people in less-developed countries cross the threshold between absolute poverty (which affords no opportunity to move) and that condition where one has acquired the minimum amount of knowledge and resources required to pursue a better life elsewhere.", "On the other hand, in developed countries issues about the social acceptability of immigration loom increasingly large in the political debate and the management of migrants' flows and their integration are highly controversial.", "Trends in labour demand Trends in the demand for labour are driven by the twin primal forces in contemporary economies: technological progress and globalisation.", "Many fear that downward pressures are deriving from both of these forces in the advanced economies.", "Historically, there have always been concerns that technological innovation would have negative effects on employment, especially during downturns.", "In this never-ending debate, views have been rather disparate, with prominent economists occasionally - and not always prudently - venturing into dismal predictions.", "In the third edition of his Principles of political economy and taxation (1821), Ricardo wrote: 'The opinion, entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy'.", "In his famous essay 'Economic possibilities for our grandchildren' (1930), Keynes wrote: 'We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come - namely, technological unemployment.", "This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.", "'6 He also thought that in one hundred years there would no longer be a need for humans to work much at all.", "Three hours of work per day would suffice to satisfy the 'old Adam in most of us', he said, that is, mankind's innate urge to produce with 'the sweat of his brow'.", "We have twelve years left to reach this goal.", "In the words of Mokyr et al.,8 'if someone as brilliant as David Ricardo could be so terribly wrong in how machinery would reduce the overall demand for labour, modern economists should be cautious in making pronouncements about the end of work.'", "Our experience so far is that, in the long run, technological change improves living standards by boosting productivity and increasing output and consumption, without destroying jobs in the aggregate.", "Average working hours have indeed come down, but they are nowhere near the level Keynes imagined.", "Doomy predictions suggesting that machines would at a certain point in the future have 'an absolute and a comparative advantage over humans in all activities'10 are likely to prove misplaced.", "However, technological advances do imply changes in the occupational structure.", "In recent years, many have detected one such change in the form of a 'polarization' of the labour market.", "Middle-range jobs involving routine-intensive tasks, which can be easily automated, have been hardest hit; as a share of total employment, they have fallen by about 7 percentage points in the US and 9 points in Europe.", "At the same time, increased employment opportunities have arisen at both ends of the skill distribution.", "The demand for high-skill professionals has increased because their skills complement technology.", "But the demand for low-skill workers has also increased, because jobs that are intensive in certain manual tasks (such as personal care services) are not easily replaced by technology, while greater productivity in the rest of the economy and higher incomes translate into greater demand for such services.", "(1930), 'Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren', in Essays in Persuasion, New York: W.W.

(ii) measures to improve human capital; (iii) measures to make structural adaptation easier and fairer ('flexicurity').", "Sustaining participation - There are three main developments that can affect \u2022 achieving gender parity in participation rates; \u2022 extending the working life; \u2022 managing migration flows and effectively integrating immigrants.", "Progress in women's participation has been substantial in Europe, but in most countries parity remains a distant prospect.", "The difference between male and female participation rates is currently around 10 percentage points in the European Union and in the United States; despite recent progress, the difference is twice as large in Italy.", "More flexible working hours and family-friendly workplace arrangements are two ways of achieving more inclusive participation (and, incidentally, a more equitable distribution of household chores).", "In many European countries there is plenty of scope for further improvement, e.g.", "concerning the supply of childcare facilities.", "The continuing increase in life expectancy makes raising the retirement age unavoidable to ensure that pension systems are sustainable; this in turn is bound to result in higher participation rates in the older age brackets.", "Many European countries are revising, or need to revise, their public pension systems.", "According to the assessment made in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure by the European Commission released one week ago, 12 members of the European Union have issues concerning the long-term sustainability of their public finances, partly due to pension expenditures.", "For those countries that adopted ambitious reforms it is important not to backtrack on them in the future.", "Already legislated pension reforms will imply in Europe, between 2016 and 2070, an increase in the statutory retirement age of more than two years;16 the impact on labour force participation for the 55-64 age class will be substantial (12 percentage points).", "The increase will be much stronger in Italy, where radical reforms enacted gradually over the past two decades have transformed what used to be one of the least sustainable public pension systems into one of the most sustainable.", "Between 1990 and 2016, average age at retirement had already increased from 57 to more than 62; it is expected to have increased by a further five years by 2070.", "Participation rates in the 55-64 age class are projected to be among the highest in large European countries.", "(Let me add that we need to revise the age brackets we typically use: '65+' can no longer be taken as synonymous with 'presumed retired'.)", "One might think that an ageing workforce would be less productive or innovative, or that grey heads keeping their jobs for longer will displace younger workers.", "There can be different points of view on this.", "On the one hand, recent research concerning Italy17 shows that the unexpected increase in the employment of mature workers that took place after changes in public pension rules in 2012 did not reduce employment in other age classes.", "On the other hand, a paper18 to be presented tomorrow finds a negative impact of ageing on dynamism and growth.", "Managing migration is the trickiest challenge of all.", "Good, dispassionate, data-based economic research may help set the stage for an informed public-policy debate.", "One paper that will be presented tomorrow19 on the impact of the regularisation of undocumented migrants on the labour market in Spain is very much in this spirit and provides interesting, nuanced results.", "Education - The improvement in the education level of the European workforce during the past ten years is partly due to targeted policies (though the latter differ greatly across countries).", "For all the progress that has been made, however, there is evidence that European education systems are still struggling to equip workers with the skills they need.", "A recent survey20 shows that, especially in southern European countries, an increasingly large share of workers are both over-educated, i.e., they received extra education not required for the job, and under-skilled, i.e., they lack certain specific task-related abilities.", "This suggests that many European education systems have not quite succeeded in integrating general and vocational education in an efficient, balanced way.", "The former appears to be biased towards purely academic knowledge, and to neglect the adaptable, problem-solving abilities required in the labour market.", "The latter focuses too narrowly on specific skills, which raise employability in the short term, but rapidly become obsolete.", "In respect of education, Italy has a problem of its own.", "Indicators of formal education (years of schooling, levels of educational attainment at specific ages) have long been significantly lower in Italy than in other countries at a comparable level of development.", "For a long time this did not seem to matter much.", "In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy's 'industrial districts' (clusters of small, specialised manufacturing firms) prospered largely on the strength of a peculiar, highly localised form of human capital, acquired in vocational schools, through on-the-job training, and through general social interaction (sometimes called the 'local industrial climate').", "In that context, the returns to formal education appeared to be low.", "Since then, however, the increasing global importance of technologyrelated skills has radically changed the picture; the 'industrial climate', important as it is, is no longer enough.", "In fact, inadequate human capital development is, I suspect, one of the reasons behind the unsatisfactory productivity growth of the country in the past couple of decades.", "Favoured by (piecemeal) reforms, some progress is being made along both dimensions of education: average schooling is up, and international comparisons of skills for young cohorts are now less unfavourable than they used to be.", "However, a gap remains, and in my opinion it receives less systematic public-policy attention than it deserves.", "Increasing flexibility, providing safety nets - Growing empirical evidence shows that greater labour market flexibility, coupled with policies that reduce labour market duality, results in better outcomes.", "For example, countries that entered the Great Recession with more flexible labour markets have generally shown greater resilience.", "Flisi, S., Goglio, V., Meroni, E., Rodrigues, M. and Vera-Toscano, E.
