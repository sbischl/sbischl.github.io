albeit somewhat slower - expansion in global activity.", "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.", "Euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.6% in December 2018, from 1.9% in November, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation.", "On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months.", "Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.", "Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.", "Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth moderated to 3.7% in November 2018, after 3.9% in October.", "M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation.", "The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth.", "The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.0% in November 2018, after 3.9% in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3%.", "The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and demand for bank credit continued to rise, thereby underpinning loan growth.", "The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing - in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises - and credit flows across the euro area.", "To sum up, a of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.", "In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities.", "The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential.", "Regarding the Governing Council reiterates the fiscal policies, need for rebuilding fiscal buffers.", "This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions.", "Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.", "Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.", "The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.", "We are now at your disposal for questions."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Inflation", "Monetary policy", "Economic growth", "Interest rates", "External demand", "Risks", "Structural reforms", "Fiscal policy", "Banking union", "Capital markets union"]}
