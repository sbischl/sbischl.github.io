currently, to be sure, suffering a setback (partly because the risks presented by over-elastic international flows were not sufficiently understood or managed) - for harnessing the power of financial integration.", "My overall message today is that we in these islands have much in common as we work within European structures to develop more effective regulatory and policy regimes that will do a better job of handling financial integration than was managed in the first decade of the new millennium.", "It was in Dublin in a speech given in 1933 before an audience of the professional middleclasses that John Maynard Keynes made one of his earliest, most widely quoted and most succinct expressions of doubt about international financial integration.", "\"Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel -

one of the seven great clearing banks, whose English branches later formed part of Royal Bank of Scotland (and now presumably heading to Santander) - with the goal of providing banking services \"across borders\" into Ireland to compete with the monopoly which had been granted there to the Bank of Ireland.", "Right into the twentieth century, the Irish banks collected deposits from rural parts - not least in the wartime years when food prices soared and there was little available in the prevailing international conditions on which to spend the export receipts; and so the savings were placed in the London money market.", "Finance was not \"primarily national\" then, and has not been since.", "The conventional wisdom identifies several dimensions of financial integration which can be ranked by their potential net benefits in terms of growth and stability.", "Exchange rate regimes determine the overall degree of monetary stability and can be designed to achieve price stability -

clearly contrary to the spirit of the single banking market.", "What this seems to come down to is a loss of confidence in the idea that foreign regulators could be relied upon and, perhaps also, a perceived lack of creditworthiness of some sovereigns even within Europe.", "The latter may be seen as not altogether unjustified, given the recent restructuring of Greek sovereign debt.", "Still, it is noteworthy that banking debt has been repaid across Europe despite the pressures that have been placed on sovereigns.", "In this process, there has been a sharp reduction in cross-border banking exposures in the market.", "Thus, both in regulation and in market behaviour, the single banking market has suffered a notable retreat.", "Restructuring and downsizing of European banks has had a similar effect, some of it ironically the consequence if pro-competition measures taken by the European Commission.", "By the early 2000s, the Irish banks had moved from their historic position as exporters of funds to the rest of the world to champion importers of funds to be recycled into finance for mortgages and for property development in the Irish world-beating property and construction bubble.", "Although this boom coincided with Ireland's euro membership, I have argued elsewhere that the link was a tenuous one.", "One indication: the fact that the British banking connection held up well in this period also: the two biggest UK banks were among those leading the headlong charge for property lending.", "Now they, and the local banks (and government), are licking their wounds in terms of heavy actual and prospective loan-loss charges.", "Financial integration generally - not just the euro - fuelled the boom to dizzying heights from which the fall has been painful.", "By now, the Irish banks, faced with a \"sudden stop\", have repaid vast borrowings from the globalised financial system largely using central bank funds to do so -

notably the use by banks in some countries of some of the borrowed funds for the acquisition of government bonds, and the way in which the LTRO has eased the sharp tightening of credit conditions that had occurred in the last quarter of 2011 - the disintermediation of cross-border bank finance in Europe has been quantitatively larger than these other two effects.", "A multi-country zone in which, despite a single currency, credit risk hampers the free-flow of banking finance is not what the inventors of the euro had in mind.", "One approach to correcting the situation is to reduce credit risk by increasing the capital of banks; certainly we need to move and are moving steadily in that direction.", "But when the lack of creditworthiness is entangled with the questions about creditworthiness of the national governments, it is not evident that even increased bank capital will be immediately sufficient.", "I for one have not been expecting the large recapitalisation of Irish banks to enable them to access international capital markets on a large scale ahead of the market re-entry of the Irish sovereign itself.", "The maxim that a sovereign rating normally provides a ceiling on the rating of any other entity has sound foundations.", "Getting away from the pernicious dynamic whereby the indebtedness and contingent exposure of sovereign and banks to each other does have what seems to be a simple solution, though not one which has yet been accepted let alone implemented.", "Using pooled European funding mechanisms directly as a means of recapitalising weak banks and acting as a backstop for future problems is an obvious way of pooling risk and breaking the sovereign-bank linkage.", "When I say directly, I mean without entailing a sovereign indebtedness.", "For example, the \u20ac17 billion injected by the Irish government last year alone, to bring the going concern banks' accounting capital up to the high ratios built into the stress tests conducted in March 2011 as part of the Troika-financed programme, added some 13 per cent of GNP to Ireland's debt.", "(Of course the Irish government also spent a lot more than that paying off creditors in the \"gone concern\" banks.)", "But if a sizable fraction of the sums invested that had been injected directly as capital by the EFSF, debt sustainability would be much less of a concern to the rating agencies and the EFSF could look forward to upside in the recovery by being the owner of two banks with a substantial national franchise.", "Although the Irish case has been exceptionally severe, it is evident that the same formula could be relevant to other countries.", "The Greek debt restructure brought most of Greece's banks under water, and they are being recapitalised by injection of EFSF bonds.", "But once again the Government - in this case the Greek government - is assuming the corresponding debt, and acquiring or increasing its ownership stakes in the banks.", "If there's any European government that doesn't need any more debt, it's the Greek one.", "Another missed opportunity, one might say, in the design of restructuring and resolution policies for European banking.", "While the banking losses for UK banks were on a smaller scale relative to the size and fiscal capacity of the UK economy, looking ahead, policymakers in countries even as large and prosperous as the UK look with some trepidation at the scale of their largest financial institutions - together with the fact that these institutions hunt in packs and do not represent a diversified pool of risks.", "One solution is to shrink the institutions and distance their liabilities from the State.", "In addition, though, especially looking to future risks, a complementary strategy, relying for bank recapitalisation where needed not on one sovereign but on the pooled fiscal resources of a larger and more diversified entity such as the EU needs to be developed.", "It's not hard to see, though, that to get such a degree of cross-border public financial engineering working smoothly at the European level requires an institutional structure that is both more comprehensive and more streamlined than exists today.", "It is clearly something much more ambitious than has ever been attempted by the IMF and World Bank.", "A Banking Union in Europe As you may have guessed, I have used a less familiar route to back into what is increasingly becoming a conventional line of argument, namely that we have found that a monetary union needs to be accompanied by stronger arrangements to ensure what might be called a Banking Union.", "In simple terms, the main elements of a banking union would be a degree of (i) centralised bank regulation, licensing and supervision as well as (ii) central responsibility for resolution and for depositor protection and any public sector solvency support.", "It's not just the spillover effects that warrant centralised supervision.", "\"Keen is the eye of the guest\" (Glo\u0308ggt er gests auga\u00f0) as an Icelandic proverb has it.", "Of course nationals should be involved in supervision: often it is they who pick up the vibes and the market talk.", "And - while I do think that many governments don't want to cede control over bank licensing issues to foreigners, I don't attach as much importance as some to the relevance of national political pressures on the supervisor.", "Thus, it's not just the implicit political protection that a plausible rogue may seek and secure: any national regulator worth their salt should be able to stand against that.", "But in periods of collective national myopia such as that which generated the property bubble in Ireland, the chance of getting somebody whose judgement is not affected is greater, the more distant their base.", "It's time to start the ball rolling in a direction going well beyond the current mandate of the ESRB and the ESAs.", "Let me be clear that centralised supervision should not blindly apply common macroprudential ratios across the whole of Europe regardless of national, regional or sectoral credit conditions.", "Where circumstances warrant it, transitory variations in capital ratios and other macroprudential tools (such as loan-to-value ratios for household mortgages) must be part of the toolkit.", "That is needed today: maximum harmonisation, understood to mean, for example, that minimum capital ratios must never vary by country, is not necessary to retain the advantages of the single market.", "Even when regulation is as centralised as I would wish it to be, the regulators must not hide behind the single market as an excuse for dodging unpopular bubble-bursting measures of restraint.", "A pan-European Deposit Guarantee Scheme is often mentioned as the second key element of any banking union.", "But of course the current guarantees, covering up to \u20ac100,000 per person, do not cover the largest and most mobile funds.", "It is not by paying out on insured depositors that the Irish public finances have been crippled.", "No: the direct fiscal costs of bank failures have always come in large part from indemnifying non-insured depositors.", "No bank senior creditor in the euro area has lost a penny in the crisis and the same is true in the United States -
