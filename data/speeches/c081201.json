the other is our capacity to produce the solid research and analysis that underpins our advice and enables us to influence public sector decisions and private sector behaviour.", "We do not supervise financial institutions for depositor protection - that falls within the realm of OSFI and CDIC.", "Nor do we regulate financial markets for investor protection - a responsibility carried out by the provincial securities commissions.", "To carry out our responsibilities, we monitor trends in financial developments in Canada and abroad, assess their implications for financial system stability, and identify risks to the Canadian financial system so that we can act and convince others to act, to limit damage from economic and financial storms.", "We publish our assessments, based on this monitoring, in our semi-annual Financial System Review.", "The next issue will be published and posted on the Bank's website on 11 December.", "Strengthening resiliency At the beginning of my remarks, I spoke briefly about the need to strengthen the resilience of our financial system.", "As I have already noted, in Canada we have taken many of the correct steps, some beginning 20 years ago, as we worked to strengthen the supervisory system for individual financial institutions.", "The coordination among domestic agencies with an interest in the financial services sector is based on a long history of effective collaboration and on a common understanding of where mandates interact.", "Yet there is still work to do so that we can be even better prepared the next time a crisis crashes onto our shores.", "History shows this is inevitable, given the difficulty investors have in going against the crowd and resisting the extremes of heady optimism in good times, and fear and even panic in bad times.", "Given that inevitability, it is imperative that we address the weaknesses in the global financial system and in the regulatory and supervisory architecture that were exposed by the current crisis, if we are to increase the resiliency of the financial system to shocks and better support economic stability.", "The Financial Stability Forum has examined lessons from the current crisis and made a number of recommendations earlier this year aimed at enhancing market and institutional resiliency.", "Work continues under the guiding principles of the FSF, to encourage a financial system that: operates with less leverage; is immune to the misaligned incentives that contributed to the current crisis; and has stronger oversight and greater transparency so that risks can be more readily identified and dealt with.", "Collectively, we must find ways to improve the transparency of complex products traded in financial markets, so that investors are better able to assess the risks they take on.", "We must also examine how best to strengthen macroprudential regulation (as opposed to institutioncentered microprudential regulation) by: bolstering controls on leverage; encouraging the buildup of adequate capital buffers in good times that can be drawn upon in bad times, thus dampening the credit cycle; developing mechanisms to provide liquidity to core financial markets so that they remain open; and expanding the amount of financial infrastructure that is properly risk-proofed, for example, custodial banks and clearing houses for credit default swaps (CDS).", "Economic outlook Let me close with a few words about the economic outlook.", "The intensification of the global financial crisis has led in Canada to an increase in credit spreads and a tightening in credit conditions generally.", "The global recession is deepening, and with it there have been further declines in the prices of many commodities and a deterioration in Canada's terms of trade, which reduces Canadian incomes.", "The nature of the slowdown in the United States, with the acute weakness in the housing and auto sectors, is particularly problematic for our exporters.", "These factors present serious challenges to Canadian industries, including key Nova Scotia industries in the primary resources, manufacturing, and tourism sectors.", "Thus, while domestic demand in Canada remains relatively healthy and the depreciation of the Canadian dollar will offset some of the declines in external demand, the risks to growth and inflation in Canada identified in the October Monetary Policy Report appear to have shifted to the downside.", "In the face of the crisis, we have already cut official interest rates by half, to 2 1/4 per cent over the past year and have stated that some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term.", "We have avoided the worst effects of the global financial crisis, thanks to a resilient financial sector built on the conservative lending practices of Canadian banks, and to our effective regulation and prudent practices in the sector.", "Still, the crisis is being felt in our economy.", "But we have taken bold steps to re-open financial markets and I can assure you that the Bank of Canada will continue to provide as much liquidity as is needed to encourage the re-establishment of the normal functioning of Canadian financial markets.", "You can also count on the Bank to add its voice to calls for initiatives to strengthen the resiliency of both the domestic and international financial systems."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Financial system resiliency", "Liquidity", "Financial crisis", "Global economy", "Macroprudential regulation", "Credit conditions", "Economic outlook", "Monetary policy", "Financial stability", "Bank regulation"]}
