underwriting standards and a few frauds that (ii) There were emerging signs of underpricing of risks as the real estate prices were spiralling fuelled by ample liquidity and the dominant wealth effect transmittal from the stock market boom.", "There were clear tax incentives at work here which made utilisation of stock market gains into real estate an extremely tax-efficient arrangement.", "(iii) A

increase in bank lending for commercial real estate.", "It was in the above backdrop that it was decided to make it costlier for banks to finance loans backed by real estate.", "It was felt that the usual sector-neutral monetary policy instruments would not be effective without posing significant costs to the economy generally.", "So while the monetary policy instruments were indeed used, the objective of this generalised, gradual tightening was quite different from the requisite stronger action in respect of bank exposures to sectors such as real estate.", "It needs to be appreciated that in the Indian context, the sharp rise in bank credit to the real estate was per se not a clear indicator of any asset price bubble given the inherent demand-supply dynamics in the economy and the genuine needs of an economy on a high growth path.", "There was a confluence of positive factors contributing to the development including a decline in inflation and stable inflationary expectations, resulting in decline in both nominal and real interest rates and availability of ample systemic liquidity, contributed no less by the rising tide of capital flows.", "Concomitantly, there was a shift in funding by the corporates to non-bank sources, including external borrowing, which forced banks to look at diversifying their lending portfolios.", "This shift also helped in meeting the increasing genuine demands on the commercial real estate front, including the office space largely accounted for by the IT boom and gradual expansion of organised retail to Tier II cities.", "The objective, I must underline, was not to address the asset price bubble per se and not to curtail genuine credit needs of the economy but to prepare the banking sector to better manage the potential downsides related to selective sectors.", "In other words we adopted what is now called the \"expected\" as well as \"unexpected\" loss approaches.", "What are the key inferences?", "First, that harmonisation of the monetary policy objectives and prudential objectives can give a more complete picture, which may not be possible if banking supervision is separate from central banks; second that macro prudential policy is no substitute for monetary tightening but should rather act as complement to monetary policy and third, that supervisors need to have the necessary independence and flexibility to act timely on the basis of available information, which may albeit be incomplete.", "Going beyond macro prudential regulation 19.", "As with all ideas which gain currency and wide acceptance in a short period of time, macro prudential regulation runs the risk of being over applied.", "However, there is an equally strong risk of making it too narrow in focus.", "It must be reiterated that macro prudential regulation is just one element of a broader macro prudential approach and needs to be supplemented with other tools to address systemic risk issues.", "Such tools could be in the form of additional prudential measures applied to all institutions with a systemic objective.", "Frankly it would be difficult to make a binary distinction between micro prudential and macro prudential policies - ultimately all macro risks translate into micro risks for financial institutions.", "The critical thing is incorporation of systemic perspective while designing policies.", "A recent survey conducted by the CGFS3 on macro prudential frameworks in various countries found that though conceptions of macro prudential policy aims and objectives were fuzzy, many countries had used various instruments keeping the broad systemic perspective in mind.", "The survey also found far more extensive use of macro prudential policies by policy makers in emerging market economies as opposed to their counterparts in the more advanced nations.", "It has helped enhance financial system resilience.", "The survey clearly shows that the emerging markets were also open to target specific sectors.", "The most widely used instruments have been measures to limit credit supply to specific sectors that are seen as prone to excessive credit growth.", "These included limits calibrated to borrower risk characteristics (caps on LTV ratios or debt/income ratios) as well aggregate or sectoral credit growth ceilings and limits on exposures by instruments.", "Many emerging economies, given their specific context already had placed measures to address specific risks - loan-to-deposit limits, core funding ratios, reserve requirements for liquidity risk and limits on open currency positions or on derivatives transactions for forex risk.", "In the Indian context, I can say that this perspective was writ large on most of the elements of the prudential framework.", "I would like to briefly mention about the key areas: Addressing interconnectedness - In regard to wholesale funding markets, prudential limits are in place on aggregate inter-bank liabilities for banks as a

even small disturbances and increases the criticality of macro prudential safeguards.", "It therefore becomes imperative for the systemic stability perspective to guide other realms of economic policy framework as well.", "I can highlight two specific areas of perceived systemic risk in our context where a macro prudential approach has been used and found useful.", "(i) Volatile capital flows: Excessive volatility of capital flows could impose significant costs to the economy beyond the obvious exchange rate impact.", "There are implications for financial stability in the form of induced risks of asset price bubbles and excessive foreign currency exposures in the financial system and external debt in general.", "Experience shows that the most volatile components of capital flows have been portfolio flows.", "These flows as well as debt flows are also procyclical.", "While capital account regime in India has accorded substantially large freedom to equity flows - both FDI as well as portfolio flows, debt flows have been attempted to be modulated contextually through a regulatory framework with a combination of quantitative and price based measures.", "Calibration of the debt flows into sovereign as well as corporate debt has been the most actively used instrument for this purpose.", "(ii) Management of sovereign borrowings - since the stop to automatic monetization of

to be seen in this context.", "Banks have been permitted to hold this mandated investment as \"held to maturity\".", "Another critical factor, which buffered sovereign balance sheet from vicissitudes of global crisis is that India does not have foreign currency market borrowing and only a limited dependence on foreign investors in respect of domestic currency debt.", "There is a strong domestic

deliberations for improving resolution capacity include limits to complexity of internal structures - preference for standalone subsidiaries, recovery and resolution planning, use of contingent

same entities expected to be bailed out.", "In the US, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act envisages a resolution regime which allows the government to impose losses on

is also the issue of implicit or explicit liquidity support by the banking system to the CCPs in the form of lines of credit or to intermediaries such as brokers and market participants in the form of margins for trades, payment commitments or other forms of guarantees.", "It is likely that the risk of transactions undertaken through CCP sit in banks/regulated financial entities books either directly or indirectly and if so it needs to be ensured that they are subject to all the prudential norms and risks are captured appropriately.", "Ideally, regulators of CCPs should prefer collaterals in the form of liquid securities rather than bank deposits or guarantees.", "However, besides the issue of CCPs, there are equally important issues relating to market practices which have bearing on the financial stability.", "One fundamental issue is the undisputable faith in the benefits of ever increasing volumes and liquidity in all markets.", "Shifting to CCPs is only shifting the risks.",
