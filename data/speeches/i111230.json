achieve macroeconomic goals; and SBP is no exception.", "The nontraditional or promotional functions, performed by the State Bank, include the development of financial frameworks, the institutionalization of savings and investment, the provision of training facilities to bankers, and the provision of credit to priority sectors.", "In this regard, SBP has always endeavored to meet the genuine credit needs of different sectors of the economy, thereby serving as a catalyst to the process of economic development.", "As I have mentioned earlier in my speeches, efforts to bring Microfinance into the mainstream formal financial system started in 2000 & 2001 in the aftermath of the promulgation of the Microfinance Ordinance and, since then, we have witnessed the establishment of new microfinance banks, the transformations of large microfinance institutions, the diversification of funding sources, the development of inclusive financial services, the emergence of alternative delivery channels, and the piloting of \"Microfinance - Credit Information Bureau\" (MCIB).", "Against this backdrop, a Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) Finance Department was established in State Bank of Pakistan in July 2008 to focus on providing an enabling regulatory framework for SMEs, assessing their credit needs, capacity development of Banks and DFIs and for building awareness through seminars and conferences, along with the promotion of financial services for export-led industrial growth.", "Regarding the regulatory approach of SBP, I would like to quote short excerpts here from my speech at the Pakistan Microfinance Country Forum: \"In developing regulations for microfinance, the State Bank has pursued a bottom-up approach, along with use of strong analytical and problem solving skills and industry consultation.", "Since the inception of microfinance banking in Pakistan, our goal has been to determine the proportionality of a regulation before it is put in place.", "Hence, the regulatory approach has remained gradual and in line with the evolution of the sector...\" \"In the new Microfinance Strategic framework 2011-15, SBP has laid out a detailed strategy to promote sustainable growth of the sector.", "The strategy's effectiveness and success hinges on growth dynamism fundamentally coming from microfinance operators themselves.", "The role of SBP is to develop the banking infrastructure, to encourage the use of successful global practices, and to provide the regulatory and supervisory mechanism that enable MFBs to develop viable business models\".", "We shall soon have the pleasure of hearing our distinguished speaker, Professor Banerjee's, thoughts on this subject.", "I am sure his lecture today will introduce us with something special on the topic, not only because of his extensive research on the subject but also because of candidness of his approach.", "Perhaps, not many of us will have witnessed this openness and honesty of thoughts earlier - the kind that is evident from the last sentence of the concluding chapter of his most recent book titled \"Poor Economics\".", "Let me quote that very sentence for you: \"At least we can stop pretending that there is some solution at hand and instead join hands with millions of well-intentioned people across the world - elected officials and bureaucrats, teachers and NGO workers, academics and entrepreneurs - in the quest for the many ideas, big and small, that will eventually take us to that world where no one has to live on 99 cents per day\".", "Now let's turn to our guest

Sloan Fellow.", "He has also been a recipient of the Infosys Prize 2009 in Social Sciences and Economics.", "Dr. Banerjee and his colleagues at J-PAL have worked with a global network of researchers to conduct experiments in the poorest places of the world and have derived conclusions that are believed to have challenged economists' and policy makers' thoughts about impoverished areas.", "Their findings have concluded beyond broad generalizations to show that the poor do not always act in ways that conform to the views and programs of wellmeaning relief agencies, revealing a portrait of poverty as complex as the movements of financial markets.", "Professor Banerjee will be delivering his lecture today on the topic of \"Micro-Credit and Financing of Small Business\".", "Needless to emphasize that it is an important topic, particularly when seen in the backdrop of the challenges faced by the poor in gaining access to formal financial services.", "Although much has been done in this regard, the stage of absolute resolution has yet to be reached.", "Here, we should not forget to mention the names of Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan in Pakistan and Professor Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh for their pioneering work in the subject area - providing a substantial source of assistance to the poor community - and their efforts for the alleviation of poverty and increases in the standard of living.", "I would like to avail this opportunity to thank Dr. Banerjee on behalf of this forum for taking out the time from his extremely busy schedule and taking the trouble to fly from USA to join us here in Pakistan.", "Before I conclude my remarks, I would also like to thank you all for joining us here and for participating in today's knowledge-sharing event.", "I am sure that Professor Banerjee's lecture today will be of immense utility for the audience, since it will enlighten us with the latest thoughts, developments and trends regarding the subject.", "It gives me immense pleasure to introduce and invite Professor Banerjee."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Microfinance", "Small Business Financing", "Central Bank", "Economic Development", "Poverty Alleviation", "Financial Inclusion", "Regulatory Framework", "Research and Development", "Human Development", "Economic Theory"]}
