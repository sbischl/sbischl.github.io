market.", "The unemployment rate has fallen, and reached 7.6 percent in the second quarter, a far cry from the level of about 11 percent in 2003, and this has occurred in the time when the rate of participation in the labor force rose from 54 percent to 57 percent; a very important development.", "Employment is of vital importance both economically and socially.", "Economically, because employment per se contributes to economic growth; socially, since one of the direct ways of dealing with poverty is to place those capable of working in employment.", "That is because there is a clear negative link between poverty and employment.", "In 2006, for example, the poverty rate among families with no wage-earner was about 76 percent; among families with one breadwinner, about 37 percent; and among families with two breadwinners, about 4 percent.", "These figures paint a very clear picture.", "Poverty in Israel, however, is closely related to Israel's demographic features.", "Based on

rates were 57 percent and 58 percent respectively.", "This is linked to the low employment rates in those two sectors, mainly among ultra-orthodox men, and Arab women.", "A closer look at employment among Arabs reveals an even more complex picture.", "An analysis of the figures in the CBS Income Surveys and the Manpower Surveys reveal several findings worthy of attention: 1) The participation rate among Arab women is rising, but it is still lower than that among Jewish women.", "Moreover, the rise in their participation rate is reflected mainly in an increase in unemployment among Arab women, with only a moderate increase in their employment.", "Thus, in 2006 the employment rate among Arab women was about 17 percent, compared with 51 percent among all women in the population. )",

particular relevance to women.", "At the same time it is essential to place education as a high priority, and I mean particularly education and training in professions and skills that will help the

large differentials, with a big sector of the population existing at a very low standard of living.", "It is clear that we must also relate to the removal of labor market and cultural barriers, including anti-minorities discrimination, anti-Arab employment discrimination at all levels, as well as doing business across the sectors.", "The Bank of Israel, for example, after years when no Arabs were employed in professional capacities - economists, accountants, lawyers - is currently making genuine efforts to increase their chances of employment in these jobs.", "We publish tenders for the populations entitled to affirmative action, and in other tenders too the approach to candidates from those sectors is one of affirmative action.", "Tenders are passed directly to several organizations
