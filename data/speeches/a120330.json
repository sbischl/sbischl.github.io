Second - we need to substantially upgrade financial sector supervision; Third - all countries should have deposit insurance; Fourth - all countries should have national crisis management plans; and \uf0b7 Fifth - building on these national plans, we need to formulate a regional crisis management plan.", "Permit me to say a few words about each of these elements.", "In many countries in the region, including my own, financial sector legislation is grossly deficient when compared to what obtains in advanced or emerging market countries.", "We, in Trinidad and Tobago, recently introduced a modern Financial Institutions Act to cover the banking system and new insurance legislation is currently in Parliament.", "Some countries in the region have been upgrading their banking legislation but the situation is not as promising with regard to insurance legislation, which remains woefully outdated in the entire region.", "This must be seen against the background that both the Jamaican financial crisis of the late 1990s and the Clico/BAICO regional crisis originated in the insurance sector.", "In principle, strengthened, harmonized legislation would be the ideal to forestall regulatory arbitrage.", "However, the obstacles faced by the CARICOM Model Financial Institutions Bill clearly demonstrated the potential challenges likely to face any kind of harmonized financial legislation.", "Countries in the region also need to upgrade financial sector supervision, including the introduction of consolidated supervision.", "I am told that a first attempt is currently underway to conduct a supervisory exercise on a systemically important institution, cross-border operations, involving supervisory teams from different jurisdictions.", "This is an important initiative and I hope that over time these kinds of exercises could become routine examples of regional regulatory cooperation.", "More and more countries are adding stress-testing and the use of financial stability reports to their supervisory tool kit.", "Properly used, these could provide early warning signals and improve the assessment of threats to the financial system.", "I know that the preparation of financial stability reports is an important component of the IDB-financed project, and I would like to return to this topic later.", "Deposit insurance schemes could contribute significantly to the maintenance of regional financial stability, as they protect lower-income depositors and prevent bank-runs.", "A harmonized regional deposit insurance scheme would be ideal but the obstacles would be formidable.", "National schemes should still be regarded as an important part of the regional stability infrastructure.", "Because financial instability can sometimes arise without adequate warning, all countries should have a national crisis management plan, to be able to move quickly and to contain the potential cost of a national financial crisis.", "Such a plan invariably requires close coordination between the various national regulatory bodies, the Government and other stakeholders, and should constitute a kind of road map to the process of crisis-resolution.", "The element of certainty that such plans bring, bolsters consumer confidence and facilitates quick crisis resolution.", "A regional crisis management plan is another indispensable part of a regional financial stability, but it is the element that is likely to present the greatest challenges.", "The critical pre-requisites to such regional plan are (i) agreement on what constitutes a systemic threat to the regional financial system; (ii) the existence of information sharing protocols among regional jurisdictions; (iii) agreement on the strategies to be considered in the resolution process and on the guiding principles for cost-sharing in the event that public intervention is deemed necessary.", "A crisis management plan for our region is likely to face several challenges, among which the region;
