both to transport and to the economy as a whole - has come from exports, which are experiencing their weakest recovery since World War II (Chart 2).", "The sluggish recovery of Canada's exports, in turn, reflects a combination of current macroeconomic conditions and longer-term trends.", "First, it reflects the weakness of the recovery in other advanced countries - notably the United States, still by far our largest trading partner.", "But Canada's share of global exports has been declining since the turn of the millennium as we have lost competitiveness and market share to China and other export economies (Chart 3).", "Canada's diminishing competitiveness is the result of disappointing productivity growth together with the considerable strengthening of the Canadian dollar over this period.", "The shift of global growth from advanced economies to emerging economies is tectonic in its scope.", "While it began a few decades ago - stemming from the economic transformation taking place in China and other emerging-market economies - it has become even more pronounced as growth in the United States and other advanced economies has been dampened in the wake of the financial crisis.", "Since the recession, emerging-market economies have accounted for two-thirds of global economic growth - up from just one-third at the turn of the millennium.", "Emerging market economies also account for one-half of the growth in global imports.", "Compare this with the United States where the economy is now well below its pre-crisis path and is likely to remain so even once the economy recovers its cyclical losses2 Clearly, exporters need to refocus their efforts to the fast-growing (Chart 4).", "Current outlook: where we are today The global economy continues to face significant challenges.", "In the major advanced economies, especially the United States and Europe, deleveraging by households and financial institutions and fiscal consolidation continue to weigh on growth.", "In the United States, the protracted dislocation of the housing market has been a drag on the recovery, despite some recent improvement.", "The debt crisis in the euro area, which intensified late last year, triggered a recession there and has had negative spillovers to many other countries, including the United States.", "In emerging market economies such as China, growth is moderating from the rapid pace of recent years, as exports to Europe have fallen off and domestic demand has also cooled.", "However, economic growth is expected to gain momentum over 2013-14, as exports to advanced economies recover.", "Despite these challenges, the profile for global economic growth has improved since the beginning of this year.", "In particular, economic conditions in the United States have improved, with employment gains and better consumer and business confidence.", "The euro area, however, is still in recession, and is projected to show only a modest recovery later this year, although the risks around this projection are high.", "Here in Canada, economic momentum is slightly firmer than a few months ago.", "Since Canada's economic growth has also turned out stronger than expected in recent quarters, we estimate that there is now less slack in the Canadian economy than previously anticipated (Chart 5).", "These growth rates may seem relatively modest, but over the 2012 to 2013 period, they are somewhat above the rate at which the potential of the economy is expanding, estimated at 2 per cent in 2012 and 2.1 per cent in 2013.", "As a result, we expect the Canadian economy to return to full capacity by early next year (Chart 6).", "Most of the growth in the period ahead is expected to come from private domestic demand.", "In particular, that growth relies on continued spending by Canadian households on consumption and housing.", "It also reflects a continued strong rise in investment spending as Canadian firms seek to expand, replace, and modernize their capacity.", "On the other hand, we are still seeing weak growth in Canada's net exports.", "That in turn reflects factors I mentioned earlier: notably the protracted recovery of demand in the United States, Canada's major trading partner, and Canada's weak competitiveness.", "The Bank forecasts that Canada's exports will regain their pre-recession peak only at the end of 2013.", "In contrast, the level of imports has already regained its pre-recession peak.", "This divergence has contributed to a decline in Canada's current account balance, which has dropped from a pre-recession surplus to a deficit of approximately 2 per cent of GDP -

a spread that peaked at about $50 a barrel earlier this year (Chart 8).", "There are many reasons for this, some of which are temporary.", "Growing global demand - especially from emerging-market economies - together with supply disruptions and rising political tensions in the Middle East have driven up the world price of oil that Canada imports.", "At the same time, shale-oil development in the United States, together with other factors, has led to ample supply at Cushing, Oklahoma, where the North American price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is set.", "The Canadian price for Western Canada Select (WCS) has been driven down further by outages in some pipelines and refineries equipped to handle Canadian oil.", "Underlying these divergences is a basic fact: the transport system determines the ability of Canadian producers to move goods such as oil to those markets where it commands a higher price, and thus to benefit from participating in a global market.", "The various aspects of the macroeconomic outlook I have been describing come together in the outlook for inflation.", "Because there is less slack in the economy and gasoline prices are also higher, the profile for inflation is expected to be somewhat firmer than anticipated by the Bank in January.", "Both overall inflation and underlying inflation are expected to remain close to 2 per cent through to the end of 2014 (Chart 9).", "Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent.", "In light of the reduced slack in the economy and firmer underlying inflation, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.", "The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.", "Opportunities for transport and logistics I would now like to touch on the longer-term trends in the global economy and what they mean for your industries.", "In 1902, Charles Melville Hays saw opportunity in the waves of immigrants pouring into the West.", "Prairie agriculture was expanding rapidly.", "Mining and forestry camps were springing up in the North.", "The rate of growth was fast and it was clear that success depended on moving people and goods across this vast land quickly and efficiently.", "Today, we can look across the Pacific Ocean where Asia is urbanizing at a breakneck pace.", "China and India are housing the equivalent of the entire population of Canada every 18 months.", "A massive middle class is being formed, growing by 70 million people each year -
