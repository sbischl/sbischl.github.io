mortgages before the financial crisis, correlated risks from these kinds of trends could have an effect that reaches beyond individual banks and borrowers to the broader financial system and economy.", "As with other financial stability vulnerabilities arising from macroeconomic risks, feedback loops could develop between the effects on the real economy and those on financial markets.", "For example, if prices of properties do not accurately reflect climate-related risks, a sudden correction could result in losses to financial institutions, which could in turn reduce lending in the economy.", "The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.", "Beyond these physical risks,

the world are now reporting climate-related financial exposures to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) under the guidelines of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).", "Based on these disclosures, the CDP estimates that the 500 largest companies by market capitalization are exposed to nearly $1 trillion in risk, half of which is expected to materialize in the next five years.", "A majority of the reporting companies integrate climate risk into their business strategies and their broader risk-management frameworks.", "An essential element of our bank supervision and regulation duties is assessing banks' risk-management systems.", "We expect banks to have systems in place that appropriately identify, measure, control,

need to manage risks surrounding potential loan losses resulting from business interruptions and bankruptcies associated with natural disasters, including risks associated with loans to properties that are likely to become uninsurable or activities that are highly exposed to climate risks.", "Climate Change and Community Reinvestment The Federal Reserve also has important responsibilities in

in order to help inform more effective responses.", "Working with local communities, the Federal Reserve staff have highlighted the ways in which lower-income households and underserved areas tend to be particularly vulnerable to natural disasters.", "With low levels of liquid savings to meet emergency expenditures, these households tend to be less resilient to the temporary loss of income, property damage, and health outcomes they face from disasters.", "In our community development work, we seek to encourage lenders and their local communities to rebuild in ways that will increase their resilience to future risks.", "Advancing Our Understanding The staff across the Federal Reserve System are researching a wide range of topics related to climate risks, including how weather and
