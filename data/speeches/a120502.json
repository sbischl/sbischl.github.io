and only slightly below the current rate of unemployment.", "Interest rates are historically low and underlying prices are stable.", "On the other hand, house prices have, on average, dropped by 20 per cent since the peak in 2007 and fell by 8 per cent in 2011.", "Turnover is low despite the historically low interest rates, and the market seems to be in a deadlock.", "Given the current interest-rate and income levels, house prices should, in Danmarks Nationalbank's view, not be as low as they are at the moment.", "Price falls may be self-reinforcing if buyers hesitate, expecting prices to come down even further.", "So it is difficult to say exactly when the market will turn, but experience from both Denmark and abroad shows that once the market begins to recover, it could move fast.", "An important factor behind the large fluctuations in house prices seen since the mid-2000s is the structure of housing taxes.", "If the property value tax in nominal terms is frozen, as it is now, the effective taxation rate declines when prices go up, and vice versa.", "Combined with deferred-amortisation loans, this has contributed to stronger fluctuations in house prices.", "The same applies to the cap on the increase in land tax.", "As a result, tax on the large increases in value seen during the boom is being phased in now, when prices are falling, making the decline even stronger.", "As regards property value tax, the solution is, in principle, simple.", "Freeze the rate of taxation, not the amount in kroner.", "With the current outlook for the housing market, this will not lead to higher taxes right now.", "But more appropriate housing taxes will help to dampen fluctuations in the market -

the option to raise 3-year loans - has given credit institutions an extra source of long-term funding.", "In many ways, these options match those provided by the ECB for European banks.", "The ECB's 3-year loans have been in high demand.", "800 European banks participated in the most recent operation.", "The first 3-year operation in Denmark will take place tomorrow.", "The second operation will be in September, and I think it would be wise to consider the two operations overall.", "Needless to say, interest will depend on the individual credit institution's situation, as well as developments in the private-sector capital markets.", "It is up to each credit institution to decide whether or not it wants to participate.", "Seen from Danmarks Nationalbank's point of view, there is no reason to turn down this opportunity if it makes business sense.", "A financial crisis has direct costs in the form of e.g.", "credit losses, but also indirect costs in terms of e.g.", "So far, a characteristic of the Danish bank rescue packages has been that the sector itself has borne the direct costs related to these packages.", "This is a good principle, which has helped to reduce the negative impact on government finances.", "Events in Europe over the last year have highlighted the significance of sound public finances.", "It is of fundamental importance to us all that the Kingdom of Denmark has a high credit standing internationally.", "I think we can say that Denmark has addressed the problems as they arose.", "By this I mean that distressed banks have been brought to our attention, and we have found solutions - either winding-up via the Financial Stability Company, mergers with other banks or tailored solutions.", "The result is a banking sector with a number of large banks and many small banks.", "Some Danish banks are still struggling, and the near future will also bring mergers and perhaps resolution of banks.", "But I believe that the problems have now been reduced to a size that is manageable within the existing framework -

by gradually phasing out deferred amortisation for mortgage loans with a view to dampening fluctuations in house prices.", "A cautious approach to deferred amortisation would also support the robustness of both borrowers and mortgage banks.", "Turning to refinancing risk, you have sought to spread the auctions for refinancing adjustable-rate loans over the year as we agreed.", "This means that a smaller bond volume is refinanced at any given time.", "So if an auction is a failure and the number of investors is insufficient, this situation will be easier to manage.", "One mortgage bank has already spread its auctions almost evenly on three dates.", "The rest have initiated the process and have from 2011 to 2012 increased the share of underlying bonds that do not mature at the turn of the year from 14 to 23 per cent.", "But more can and should be done to reduce the refinancing risk.", "For example: - If refinancing is spread over the whole year and refinancing auctions are conducted well in advance, this will reduce the impact of short-term shocks in the financial markets considerably.", "- Use of longer-term financing will reduce the total volume of loans to be refinanced within a given period.", "That will increase robustness.", "In addition, the ability of the individual borrower to bear the refinancing risk can be increased.", "If individual loans are financed using several bonds with different terms to maturity, shortterm market turmoil will affect only a small share of each loan.", "This will strengthen investor confidence, even in a situation with a brief, but strong increase in interest rates.", "I see no urgent need for further specific legislation in these areas as you are seriously addressing the challenges yourselves.", "Let me recapitulate: Solutions may differ, but should serve the following purposes - in random order: - refinancing risk must be reduced, - the need for any top-up collateral must be met before it becomes relevant, - the procyclical impact of home financing should be dampened, - and the vulnerability of homeowners to extraordinary changes in financing conditions must be reduced.", "It will require a huge effort, but you have already come a long way.", "Keep up the good work!", "Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none"], "topics": ["European debt crisis", "House prices", "Financial crisis", "Euro area", "Mortgage market", "Refinancing risk", "Housing market", "Systemically important financial institutions", "Fiscal policy", "Monetary policy"]}
