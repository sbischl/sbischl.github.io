interest rate by 200 basis points, bringing the total reduction since the beginning of 2001 to 375 basis points.", "This substantial monetary easing, together with measures taken by Canadian

business confidence and business investment, which remain weak in many countries, bounce back.", "Here, it is important to note that in Canada we did not have the same degree of overinvestment in

Canada's current view is that economic growth in Canada will be relatively modest in the first half of 2002-between 1 and 2 per cent, on an annualized basis-but that it will accelerate in the second half-to a range of 3 to 4 per cent-and strengthen further in 2003.", "This output profile means that there will be an appreciable amount of excess supply in the economy through 2002.", "Because of

current low levels of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart.", "There is a good chance that when the final national accounts data for Canada come out, we will see positive, albeit modest, economic growth in both the last quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of this year.", "At this point, all available data suggest that final demand in the fourth quarter was stronger than we had
