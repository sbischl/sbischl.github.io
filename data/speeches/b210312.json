to be modest, with uncertainty over when the spread of COVID-19 will subside, it is difficult to project at this stage that the inflation rate will gather momentum toward approaching the 2 percent

Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the 2 percent price stability target.", "This current framework consists of three measures: yield curve control, the purchase of risk assets, and the Bank's public commitment regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.", "In addition to these measures, the Bank has taken the following three actions to address the pandemic since March 2020, as shown in Chart 13: (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) to provide support mainly for corporate financing; (2) an ample and flexible provision of funds to ensure stability in financial markets; and (3) active purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) to lower the risk premia in asset markets.", "I hold the view that these actions taken in response to COVID-19 have thus far contained the disturbance in the financial and capital markets and produced some positive effects on financing, mainly of firms.", "Chart 13 Actions Taken by the Bank to Address COVID-19 (1) Supporting Corporate Financing Program to Support Financing in Response to COVID-19

and significant downside risks, financing, mainly of firms, is likely to remain under stress for the time being.", "To address this situation, the Bank decided at the December 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) to extend the duration of the Special Program by six months until the end of September 2021, thereby continuing to support financing, mainly of firms.", "The Bank will continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and not hesitate to take additional easing measures -- including further extension of the Special Program -- if necessary.", "Moreover, as a forward-looking approach, the Bank has decided to conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing, with a view to supporting the economy and thereby achieving the price stability target of 2 percent.", "Based on the premise that the Bank will maintain the current framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control, it will assess various measures and make public its findings, likely at the March 2021 MPM.", "My View on the Conduct of Monetary Policy I voted for the Bank to take the aforementioned actions in response to COVID-19, but I have continued to dissent from the majority decision on the following two measures: yield curve control and the Bank's commitment regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.", "This was based on my view that it is necessary not only to support financing and provide liquidity but also to implement measures to contain any downward pressure that may be exerted on prices and thereby support Japan's economy to return to a powerful growth path.", "I would first like to present my view on the transmission channels through which changes in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and subsequent public health measures affect economic activity and prices.", "A surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, for example, will lead to the tightening of public health measures.", "This will in turn not only curb private consumption directly but could also dampen private consumption and firms' fixed investment indirectly, through deterioration in consumer sentiment and increased uncertainty over economic and financial conditions.", "These developments will exert downward pressure on prices through deterioration in the output gap toward excess supply.", "Judging from a model that assumes the aforementioned transmission channels and estimating future price developments based on Japan's situation regarding COVID-19 to date, the risk of prices becoming stagnant has increased further.", "If the timing of a turnaround in the output gap toward excess demand is delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19, prices are expected to remain under downward pressure for a longer period, compared with a scenario in which there is no resurgence.", "Moreover, given that the formation of inflation expectations is highly adaptive in Japan, the longer the rate of inflation remains stagnant, the less likely inflation expectations are to rise.", "As I have explained, if there are repeated resurgences of COVID-19, prices are expected to remain stagnant for a protracted period, with both the output gap and inflation expectations being pushed down.", "Based on this recognition, I consider that the Bank needs to strengthen monetary easing in terms of yield curve control and its commitment regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.", "As for yield curve control, with a view to encouraging firms to make investment for growth, such as through active business fixed investment for the post-COVID-19 era, it is appropriate for the Bank to lower short- and long-term interest rates by actively purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs).", "I believe that supporting investment for growth through monetary easing does not necessarily involve a trade-off with the spread of COVID-19.", "In terms of the Bank's commitment regarding the future conduct of monetary policy, in order to avoid Japan's economy returning to deflation, further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy is necessary, and it is appropriate for the Bank to revise the forward guidance for the policy rates to make such guidance more powerful by relating it to the price stability target, so as to enable the Bank to take actions based on concrete conditions.", "As for the assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing, I consider it necessary first and foremost to thoroughly analyze and examine the effects on economic activity and prices in terms of each measure -- namely, yield curve control, the purchase of risk assets, forward guidance for policy rates, and the inflation-overshooting commitment.", "In addition, the Bank needs to take into account the current situation, in which it is difficult to envision the path for achieving the price stability target, with economic activity and prices remaining under downward pressure for a prolonged period due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19.", "On this basis, I believe that it is necessary for the Bank to carefully assess the current measures, and then, together with the findings of such assessment, consider and explain its future strategies.", "As a member of the Policy Board of the Bank, I will continue to do my utmost to achieve and maintain the price stability target."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none",
