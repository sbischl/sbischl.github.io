features of Islamic finance require that financial transactions are supported by an underlying economic activity, thus ensuring that there is a close link between financial and productive flows.",

incentive for the appropriate due diligence to be undertaken by the Islamic financial institutions to ensure that the profits are commensurate with the risks being assumed.", "Aspects of governance
