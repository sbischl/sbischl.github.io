Today, they again provide a venue for us to take a closer look at the issues that confront us, as they relate to the Philippine banking system.", "And, we look forward, perhaps to a broader Asian Summit in the Philippines at an opportune time in the near future.", "Let me therefore now focus on today's agenda.", "I will not give you a litany of numbers to prove that the Philippine banking system has remained strong in contrast to other jurisdictions.", "The positive performance indicators are quite familiar to you.", "For instance, you all know that system resources have been growing, funded by increased balances of deposits and more loans extended to borrowers.", "Let me, however, share with you storylines that are not cited often enough... On the deposits side, growth was faster in the years after the height of the crisis than the years before.", "But from 2007 - at the time that the mortgage crisis was already unfolding in the US - Philippine system-wide deposit balances increased by 13.40% per year all the way to 2011... On the loan side, the numbers are even more dramatic.", "Add to this, the fact that increased loan portfolio was not a case of liquidity chasing after every credit exposure.", "A simple look at the numbers will show that the NPL ratio has actually been falling since the turn of the century just as the coverage ratio has been rising.", "For universal and commercial banks, our latest number is an NPL ratio of 2.06% and a coverage ratio of 135%.", "All of these metrics converge into the capital adequacy ratio which is the central, though not exclusive, metric under the Basel Accord.", "The often-cited statistic is that our banks have consistently maintained, on average, capital ratios well above the regulatory thresholds.", "On a consolidated basis, system CAR is hovering at 17%, of which 14 percentage points pertain to the Tier 1 ratio.", "Most will leave the system review to the measures that I just shared.", "However, it is important for the BSP to make a point about access to the banking market because financial inclusion is much more than just a buzz word to us.", "Today, we have a wider reach not only from the significant increase in physical banking officers (which surged from 21,394 at end 2007 to 26,057 at end 2011) but also through ATMs (which grew from 7,155 to 10,659 over the same period) and the active use of technology through our mobile banking framework.", "Indeed, it can be said that we now have a wider footprint of banking services that caters to the needs of our differentiated public.", "Ladies and gentlemen, all of these positive developments neither happened overnight nor happened on their own.", "We believe that they reflect the enabling environment which we have invested in with the active support of and coordination with market stakeholders.", "While we can itemize each and every circular and policy prescription we have issued, I believe that we can categorize them into six main areas.", "\u2022 I would start with governance.", "This is most critical because without these overarching guidelines, the conflicts of interest inherent in finance would prove to be untenable.", "Risk management comes to mind next because of our deliberate shift from transactions review to a risk-based supervisory framework.", "Microfinance and financial inclusion are advocacies which we have pursued well before it became popular to do so.", "To complement the prudential framework, there needed to be improvements in the delivery of banking services.", "We certainly could not and would not neglect contributing to the development of the capital market.", "As the other facets involved direct improvements of market components, we have not forgotten the needs of the banking public either for redress mechanisms or for financial education.", "Each facet is a critical component without which our prudential framework will have major deficiencies.", "Taken collectively, they represent the foundations upon which we envision a thriving banking market that is responsive to the evolving needs of its public.", "This of course begs the question.", "If we have a prudential framework in place, which appears to have withstood the most intense of global shocks, is there anything else that needs to be done?", "The answer is... definitely, there is still much more that needs to be done.", "And as in the past, we look to those of you in the market to join us in the work ahead.", "There are, however, challenges.", "First, the policy questions before us are evolving.", "Second, conduct and the performance standards that market participants must adhere to are also shifting.", "Then, traditional financial relationships aren't necessarily still true.", "Finally, time-honored policy transmission mechanisms no longer seem to hold in the past.", "In response to these challenges, BSP has had to realign our own policy framework -
