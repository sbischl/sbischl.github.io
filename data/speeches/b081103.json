(2) providing a liquidity lifeline; and (3) enhancing deposit insurance, appears to have some effect in terms of shoring up confidence.", "This has been evident in the recent improvements in the LIBOR-OIS and TED spreads.", "The LIBOR-OIS and TED spreads are viewed as an indirect measure of funds availability in the market.", "A decrease in spreads typically signals an increased willingness to lend.", "A similar slowdown in the widening of CDS spreads in Asia has recently occurred as certain regional central banks also lowered policy rates and injected liquidity to their markets through repurchase facilities.", "These are \"tractions\" that we are seeing in the markets.", "I believe these will eventually constrain markets from doing a \"free-fall\".", "Pockets of the financial markets are slowly adjusting, perhaps in confident response to the recent display of concerted, collaborative and cooperative action from officials of both the major and emerging economies.", "If these tractions continue and broaden in scope, we may begin to see a further unfreezing of credit and a muting of the negative feedback from the financial turmoil to the real economy.", "Having said that, however, much depends on whether the slowdown in the US and other major economies would be shorter or shallower than first expected.. II.", "Impact on the Philippines How do all of these developments impact on the Philippine economy?", "The Philippine financial markets have not been spared from the ripple effect of the worsening global financial strains.", "As I noted in my introduction, the peso has weakened, credit spreads have widened and the stock market has fallen, like in the other countries.", "What concerns us now is that a negative feedback loop from the financial markets to the real economy cannot be fully discounted.", "In the Philippines, the macroeconomic impact of the current turmoil will depend, in part, on the linkages between the Philippine economy and that of the US.", "These linkages are in the areas of trade, remittances and investments.", "There is no decoupling.", "The US accounted for about 17 percent of total RP exports in 2007.", "Although this is lower than the 30 percent in 2000 and has been declining since, the US slowdown poses a downside risk to the country's export earnings as some exports to other countries are subsequently redirected to the US market.", "Remittances are another important channel through which the US economic slowdown could manifest itself in the Philippines.", "More than 30 percent of overseas Filipinos (OFs) were based in the US as of 2007.", "Moreover, more than 30 percent of net foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Philippines came from the US (in 2007).", "Slower US economic activity may, therefore, cause a reduction in inward foreign direct investment.", "The expected slowdown in other advance economies, including those in Europe and Japan, dampens further the country's FDI prospects.", "Sources of resilience of the Philippine economy While the Philippines is not immune to the contagion from the global financial turbulence, underlying strengths or buffers in the economy remain that can help it ride out the storm.", "The Philippines is in a good position to withstand the crisis for the following reasons: First, the country's macroeconomic fundamentals are sound and the economic growth potential remains good; Second, domestic demand remains a major contributor to growth; Third, the external payments position is stable; Fourth, dividends from structural reforms adopted by financial institutions since the Asian crisis have helped mitigate the impact of external shocks; and Fifth, information disclosure practices have improved.", "Let me highlight some of these factors in greater detail...", "Favorable growth dynamics The economy has continued to expand despite a difficult external environment.", "In the second quarter of 2008, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.6 percent on the back of relatively strong performances of manufacturing, agriculture and fishery, trade, private services and construction.", "On the expenditure side, the main drivers of growth have been private consumption and, to some extent, investments.", "Domestic demand has proven to be fairly resilient in previous episodes of global slowdowns and should be helpful once again in buttressing the economy from the fallout of the ongoing global slowdown.", "Stable external payments position The country's external payments position remains favorable.", "The balance of payments - although it is beginning to come under pressure from global developments - has remained in surplus for the first nine months of 2008 at US$1.5 billion.", "The continued strength of the BOP is underpinned by the sustained strong remittances of overseas Filipinos as well as higher services receipts, particularly from business process outsourcing.", "Let me go into some specifics: Remittances.", "Overseas Filipino remittances reached US$11 billion in the first eight months of 2008.", "OF remittances are expected to grow on the back of improvements in the quality of workers deployed.", "In addition, the geographical diversification of our deployments as well as the relatively inelastic demand for our growing deployed workers in the medical related fields, should form a buffer against a global economic downturn.", "Revenues from BPO services also provide some lift (actual revenues for 2007 reached US$5 billion according to the BP Association of the Philippines).", "The BPO industry is poised to grow by 39 percent for 2008 on account of strong demand for back office, engineering and financial services.", "In a period of slowdown, our BPO centers may benefit as they remain cost-competitive relative to the other regional centers.", "The country also continued to build up sufficient international reserves to cover import payments and to service external debt.", "The current GIR level of US$36.7 billion as of endSeptember 2008 covers about six months of imports of goods and payments of services and income and is equivalent to nearly three times the country's short-term external debt based on residual maturity.", "Stable banking system Going to the banking sector.", "You must have heard me say that direct exposure of Philippine banking system to the financial institutions currently in trouble is limited.", "Our banks continue to be innately conservative, domestically-oriented, and have not moved to the business model of \"originate and distribute\", which has propelled the popularity of structured products in the major economies.", "In addition, the reforms implemented to clean up bank balance sheets, strengthen bank capitalization through Basel II, improvements in governance structures, enhancements in risk management systems and adoption of international accounting standards have all come together to create a steadily growing, adequately capitalized, significantly stronger banking system.", "\u2022 Banks remained capitalized at levels above both the BSP-regulatory requirement and the BIS standard.", "This provides a buffer to banks to absorb more \"shocks\" going forward.", "\u2022 NPL Asset-quality has been enhanced -

Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, While the Philippines is not immune to the impact of the financial market turmoil, it is relatively better insulated now to ride out the crisis.", "The continued resilience of the economy and soundness of the banking system, buttressed by gains achieved from purposeful reforms (past and present), puts us in a good position to deal with adversities in the global environment.", "In addition, we are seeing pockets of improvement in the financial markets, which can help to build confidence and prevent a \"free fall\".", "Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency.", "We must continue to be mindful of the risks that could impede the growth of the Philippine economy.", "We can learn a lesson from the little chicken in that children's fable - like the chicken, we must be watchful of our surroundings.", "But, unlike the chicken, we must take courage.", "If, however, we are armed with the correct information and an appropriate plan of action, we should be able to get out of this crisis stronger.", "In this endeavor, the BSP looks forward to the continued support extended by the Consular Corps.", "Your work of promoting the dissemination of correct information about our country takes on a more critical dimension as we try to cope in these very trying times.", "Thank you very much and Mabuhay tayong lahat!"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Philippine economy", "financial market turmoil", "credit tsunami", "macroeconomic fundamentals", "banking system", "policy response", "external payments position", "remittances", "BPO services", "risk management"]}
