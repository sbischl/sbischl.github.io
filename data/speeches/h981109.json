problem is ridiculously simple.", "In the days when computer memory was scarce, programmers got into the frugal habit of using only two digits to write a date, so that 1998 was represented as 98.", "But, as 99 is a higher number than 00, millions of computers simply cannot place the year 2000.", "Instead, they may read the first year of the new millennium as the first year of the century, or as a date that does not exist.", "Even if they pass that test, they still may fail to notice that 2000, unlike most centennial years, is a leap year.", "Thus, at the century-date change or even before - a large number of computer systems, software programs and embedded chip devices currently used will produce errors or will malfunction - unless the date or program logic is modified.", "With regard to

"The Bundesbank - like other EU central banks - is confronted with the Y2K problem in many respects.", "Internal preparatory work for the Year 2000 change started in good time.", "The Bank's

data-processing application procedures will be available in tested year 2000-proof versions.", "An earlier date is not possible, because conversion work for Stage Three of European monetary union is to be completed as a priority.", "In this context, by the way, a lot of preparatory work, mainly in applications for accounting and payment systems, will automatically be included with respect to Y2K.", "With regard to the context of national payment and settlement systems, however, the Bundesbank acts as a key service provider but also as a central co-ordinator for cashless payments.", "The

be conducted.", "In the field of retail payments, the Bundesbank, as the primary \"interface\", provides its customers with the year-2000-compatible processing of payment data.", "It will also ensure that its data-processing procedures are robust enough, should individual customer systems fail to operate in a year-2000-compatible manner.", "As you all know, the Bundesbank is responsible for monetary policy in Germany till the end of this year, but will also continue to form part of the banking supervision authority after the start of Stage Three of European monetary union.", "In his luncheon address, my colleague Mr Edgar Meister, who is in charge of the Bundesbank \u0301s Banking Supervision Department, and chairman of the ECB-Committee on this subject, is going to outline the

are being coordinated by the Ministry of Economics.", "In this position, the ministry is also overseeing the preparatory activities of the industrial sector in Germany.", "Special attention is being given to the readiness of core infrastructure providers because of their major significance for economic activity in general.", "In particular, given the financial sector's heavy dependence on telecommunications, water, energy and transportation, any failure to meet the Year 2000 challenge in any of these sectors could lead to serious disruptions at the national and international levels.", "In addition to that, it would probably adversely affect all contingency plans of the entire economy.", "As you know, our latest Joint Year 2000 Council Bulletin also focuses on this matter, and I hope that we will have an opportunity to attract public attention in this respect at the forthcoming press conference.", "Preparations at the European level At the European level, the Bundesbank, being a member of the ESCB, is taking part in the activities of the ECB to ensure the Year-2000-compliance of ESCB-wide systems and applications.", "The necessity for the ECB and the ESCB to give EMU top priority poses an additional challenge to their activities in connection with Y2K.", "However, all the new payment and accounting systems which will be implemented next year will be Y2K-proof, so that it should be possible to cope with the remaining challenges during 1999.", "In operational terms, the newly developed large-value-payment system TARGET is going to function by joining together
