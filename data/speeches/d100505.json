b. introduce legal and institutional reforms necessary for its democratic, self reliant and efficient functioning; and c. take measures to improve the quality of management.", "It is a matter of satisfaction that 25 States have signed the MoU and progressed towards implementation of reform agenda.", "Although the time period prescribed by the Government for entering into MoU has lapsed, the remaining States may approach the Government in this regard, if they so like, and complete the process.", "The package was rolled out in January 2006 and it was envisaged that all regulatory actions including compliance to Section 11(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to Co-operatives) should be kept in abeyance for three years.", "Three years have already passed.", "However, only 14 States out of 25, which have signed MoU have been able to amend the Co-operative Societies Act.", "This has resulted in slow implementation of the package.", "As the financial assistance under the package has to be released only on the implementation of legal and institutional reforms, as against total estimated financial assistance of Rs.,596 crore envisaged in the revival package, NABARD has, so far (by the end February 2010), released an amount of Rs.,561.39 crore towards Government of India's share for recapitalisation of 41,295 PACS in twelve States, while the State Governments have released Rs..82 crore as their share.", "It is imperative for all the States that have executed the MoU for implementation of the package to carry out necessary amendments to the respective State Cooperative Societies Acts without any further delay.", "Any delay only delays capitalization and make the system further weaker.", "Further, after amendment to the Co-operative Societies Act, all States should follow the spirit behind the amendment whole-heartedly so that the rural co-operative credit structure can operate in a healthy way.", "Legal and institutional reforms have been recommended under the package to bring about improvement in credit discipline and financial management of the cooperative credit structure.", "They are expected to enable and induce rejuvenation of the structure by promoting voluntary, democratic, member-centric, self-governing mutual thrift and credit institutions.", "The State Government's role in this scenario is expected to be not one of intrusive patronage, but one of promoting good and skilled management.", "This process may be slower than one would wish, but it would certainly result in a stronger and healthier structure to serve the needs of the rural people.", "As you are aware, a large number of State Co-operative Banks and Central Cooperative Banks were functioning without a banking license for decades.", "The Committee on Financial Sector Assessment recommended that no unlicensed co-operative banks should be allowed to function beyond 2012.", "Reserve Bank took a decision to license those cooperative banks which have Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CARA) of 4% and above.", "The revival package also helped in this regard.", "I am happy to share with you that within a period of last five months, we have issued license to 8 StCBs and 105 CCBs.", "However, 9 State Co-operative Banks and 191 Central Co-operative Banks still remain unlicensed.", "With recapitalization of these institutions, many of them would be eligible for a license.", "All co-operative banks should endeavour to become eligible to get a license before March 2012.", "Financial inclusion and co-operatives 9.", "The Financial inclusion agenda being pursued vigorously by the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India cannot be accomplished without the involvement of rural cooperative institutions.", "Rather, they have the biggest role to play in this regard.", "Leveraging Information technology is a must for achieving financial inclusion and delivering efficient service to the people.", "Full computerization of all tiers of the co-operative institutions along with use of information and communication technology and issue of biometric cards to members has to be achieved to enable to serve the people.", "You all are aware that all conceivable reform measures have been embedded in the proposed amendments to the Co-operative Societies Acts.", "However, I want to highlight certain issues, which need to be addressed with urgency.", "i. PACS are at the base of the entire short-term co-operative credit structure and their health affects the higher tiers.", "Efforts to be made to make them efficient and profitable.", "We have to go back to good old days of making PACS thrift oriented institutions.", "PACS generally do not make an effort to mobilize deposits but act as a channel for disbursement of loans by availing refinance.", "They should make efforts to mobilize deposits from members in order to become self-sustaining.", "This would also promote savings habit among members.", "Increasing member stake through savings in PACS will result in better involvement of members and a much more alert membership and much better performance of PACS including higher loan recovery.", "Co-operatives should function in the true spirit of co-operation and managed by duly elected members.", "Elections should be held regularly.", "In order to improve the quality of management, Directors and CEOs should be appointed on the basis of professional competence, integrity and merit.", "Administrative interference in day-today management should be stopped.", "The reform package envisages freedom to all tiers of the structure to avail loan from any of the RBI regulated entities at competitive rates of interest.", "I am not sure, if any effort has been made in this regard.", "This must be tried to derive the cost benefit and profitability.", "Freedom should be given for pricing in a fair and transparent manner.", "v.
