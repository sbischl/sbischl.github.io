widely in equities, bonds and real estate.", "This has provided for good returns and risk diversification.", "Interest rates worldwide have fallen to low levels in recent years.", "The prospect of continued moderate global growth means that interest rates may remain low ahead.", "The estimated expected real return on the oil fund has therefore been revised down and is now quite a bit lower than 4 percent.", "In December, Norges Bank advised the Ministry of Finance to increase the equity allocation in the fund.", "Historically, equities have produced higher returns than bonds, but the returns have also been more volatile.", "A lower return on bonds is the price we pay for dampening volatility in the fund's value.", "In recent years bonds have become a more effective, but also more expensive, hedge against volatility.", "Both conditions suggest a somewhat lower allocation to bonds.", "Changes in the Norway's overall petroleum wealth also warrant a lower allocation to bonds.", "Apart from the oil fund, this wealth consists of oil and gas still in the ground.", "There has always been a considerable risk from having a large share of the nation's wealth linked to a single commodity.", "But this share has fallen.", "Only a decade ago, oil and gas reserves made up two-thirds of Norway's petroleum wealth.", "Today that share has dropped to about a third.", "Our aggregate wealth has become more diversified, which means we can tolerate slightly higher volatility in our financial wealth.", "The Government has today announced that it will propose an increase in the equity allocation in the oil fund to 70 percent.", "At the same time, the estimated expected real return on the oil fund is adjusted down to 3 percent.", "The choice of equity allocation is an important decision.", "But an even more important choice is the level of oil revenue spending.", "Fluctuations in the value of the fund present challenges for fiscal policy and for the fiscal rule.", "Let me comment somewhat further on this issue.", "The oil fund and the fiscal rule have long been important pillars of Norwegian economic policy.", "One key goal has been to preserve large parts of our petroleum wealth for future generations.", "There has also been an explicit desire to shield the Norwegian economy from swings in oil prices.", "Allow me to quote from the Revised National Budget for 1995: \"Revenues from the petroleum sector vary more over time than other revenues.", "[...] a fund mechanism [...] makes it easier to decouple annual spending of petroleum revenues from current revenues.\"", "Returns in financial markets also vary more over time than other revenues.", "With the current size of the oil fund, fluctuations in the value of the fund may be considerable from one year to the next.", "Fiscal policy and the Norwegian economy must be shielded from these fluctuations in the years ahead.", "The needed decoupling that was highlighted in the Revised National Budget for 1995 has taken on a new form.", "Chart: Fiscal spending of petroleum revenues Combined with high oil prices and healthy returns, the fiscal rule has brought considerable fiscal leeway.", "This year around a fifth of government spending will be financed by transfers from the oil fund.", "The level of oil revenue spending has reached 8 percent of mainland GDP.", "There will be less leeway further ahead.", "Last year was the first time money was transferred out of the oil fund to finance the non-oil deficit.", "We can no longer assume that the oil fund will continue to grow as a share of the economy.", "With a high level of oil revenue spending, there is a risk of a sharp reduction in the fund's capital.", "This could, for example, happen if a global recession triggers both a decline in oil revenues and low or negative returns on the fund's capital.", "If other government revenues fall, and the expenditure side of the government budget is shielded, the oil fund will have to foot the bill krone for krone.", "Chart: Probability of 50 percent decline in the size of the GPFG The risk of a sharp decline in the size of the fund is further illustrated in this chart, which shows the probability of a 50 percent decline in the fund over a ten-year horizon.", "In the initial year, fiscal spending of oil revenues is around 3 percent of the fund's value - that is to say close to today's level.", "Government expenditure is then assumed to grow in pace with the expected growth of the economy, which means the expenditure side is shielded even in a situation with declining revenues.", "When and if that occurs, the oil fund will carry the cost.", "With a 60 percent allocation to equities, the probability of a 50 percent decline in the fund over a ten-year period is just over 1 percent.", "A higher equity share increases this risk, but the risk is still moderate.", "However, with a higher level of oil revenue spending, the downside risk increases.", "The yellow bars illustrate a scenario where oil revenue spending in the initial year increases to 4 percent - a familiar figure.", "In that case, the risk of having to draw down the fund increases considerably.", "The probability of a 50 percent decline in the fund increases threefold.", "My main message concerning this issue: First, fiscal policy must be decoupled from financial assets subject to considerable volatility.", "Second, it would be unwise to increase petroleum revenue spending from today's level even if the fund continues to grow.", "The period of rising government spending of petroleum revenues should now be over.", "Inflation targeting has funcioned well In 2001, the same year as the fiscal rule was established, Norway introduced an inflation target as part of its monetary policy framework.", "A number of countries had, in the preceding years, abandoned exchange rate targeting in favour of inflation targeting.", "This policy change was a response to the challenges associated with the fixed exchange rate regimes in an increasingly open global economy.", "Since the financial crisis, monetary policy has faced an uphill struggle in many countries.", "The economic consequences of the crisis have been substantial, and the contributions from fiscal policy have been meagre.", "Weakened growth capacity has magnified the challenges.", "At the same time, persistently low interest rates pose challenges to financial stability.", "Yet despite the fact that monetary policy has been stretched far, no country has retreated from the basic rationale behind flexible inflation targeting.", "In Norway, the Ministry of Finance is now considering whether the regulation on monetary policy should be modernised.", "After more than fifteen years, this is only natural.", "It should nevertheless be noted that the system has functioned well.", "Since the introduction of inflation targeting, the Norwegian economy has been exposed to a number of major shocks, most of which have originated beyond Norway's borders.", "In responding to these shocks, flexibility and scope for judgement in the conduct of monetary policy have been significant strengths.",

dampening fluctuations in the real economy.", "As long as inflation is firmly anchored, monetary policy can address other concerns.", "We can seek to counteract the build-up of financial imbalances by
