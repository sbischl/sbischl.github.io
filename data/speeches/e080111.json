committed to pursuing this strategy, as transparent communication is crucial in enhancing the credibility and impact of its policy decisions.", "The participative approach adopted by the Bank has permitted prompt handling of issues affecting the banking industry.", "The Bank hosted seven meetings of the Banking Committee in 2007, a marked departure from the previous quarterly schedule.",

projects.", "As we close 2007, it is with pleasure that I review developments in the economic and financial landscape during this year, and look forward to some of the most important tasks awaiting us in 2008.", "This year has seen a rebound in economic activity with real GDP growth rate forecast at 5.6 per cent compared to an estimated 5.0 per cent in 2006.", "This was mainly driven by the tourism and construction sectors where growth rates are forecast to jump from an estimated 3.5 per cent and 5.2 per cent, respectively, in 2006 to 13.1 per cent and 15.0 per cent this year.", "These high growth rates compensated for (i) the slowdown to 3.5 per cent, from 4.0 per cent in 2006, forecast in Manufacturing despite a significant recovery noted in Textile, and (ii) the contraction of 6.8 per cent forecast in Agriculture, including sugarcane.", "Most economic indicators have improved during the year.", "Capital formation, excluding the purchase of aircraft and marine vessel, accelerated.",

per cent and 13.8 per cent in 2006.", "Inflation, which was at 8.9 per cent at end-2006, climbed to 10.7 per cent in June before gradually trending down to stand at 9.1 per cent in November and is now expected to fall to 8.8 per cent in December.", "On the external front, during the first three quarters of this year, the current account registered a deficit of Rs8,659 million, with the deficit in the third quarter lower than the deficit recorded during the same period last year.", "Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country from January to September, estimated at Rs9 billion, was already higher than the total of Rs7.2 billion recorded in 2006.", "FDI flowed mainly from the United Kingdom and the United States into Tourism, principally the Integrated Resorts Scheme.", "As a result of the improvement in the current account balance, reflecting combined higher surpluses on the services, income and current transfers accounts, and higher FDI and portfolio flows, the overall balance of payments showed a surplus of Rs12,114 million up to September, as against a deficit of Rs4,573 million in 2006.", "Against this background, expansion of the Financial Intermediation sector was sustained with a growth rate of 7.3 per cent forecast this year.", "The banking industry has been particularly dynamic, with the entry of new participants and existing banks carrying on the expansion

respect, the Bank has reviewed the regulations and licensing procedures of money-changers and foreign-exchange dealers to encourage more competition and raise standards.", "In general, the growth in banking stems not only from domestic operations but also from international business.", "In fact, business conducted with non-residents has increased by 30 per cent since last year, indicating that banking is surging beyond geographical boundaries, with our banks able to compete successfully both regionally and internationally.", "It may be highlighted that out of total growth of Rs135 billion in total banking assets during the year, over 80 per cent is attributed to business conducted with non-residents and Global Business Licence holders.", "Banks are growing not only in size to meet the growing demands of a buoyant economy, but also in sophistication.", "Needless to say, increased activity in the sector has heightened competition for skilled manpower, giving rise to lateral staff movement and even staff poaching in many cases.", "Consequently, the sector has seen a sharp rise in salaries at middle-management and higher levels.", "The continuous evolution of the domestic financial environment and the need for domestic banks to keep up with competitors in an increasingly globalised economy has led the Bank to formulate appropriate strategies in various domains to shape the Bank for the future, and review its internal organisation structure.", "In 2007, the Bank implemented a number of changes to its policy-making process and operations.", "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was set up on 23 April.", "Following the amendment of the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004 in August, the MPC is empowered to formulate and determine the monetary policy of the Bank.", "The MPC consists of the Governor as Chairperson, the two Deputy Governors, two Board Directors, and three external persons having recognised experience in the field of economics, banking or finance, one of whom is a Professor of Monetary Economics at the University of Frankfurt, Germany.", "The MPC also benefits from the wide-ranging experience of an Adviser, a former Governor of the Bank of Argentina and the current Director of the Centre for Central Banking Studies of the Bank of England.", "In the current setup, there is a possibility that the Bank's executives may find themselves in a minority position in the MPC.", "The MPC met three times this year to decide on the stance of monetary policy.", "The key Repo rate was increased by 75 basis points at the June meeting as inflation was hovering in the double-digit region, and there were significant upside risks with regards to international commodity prices.", "The two subsequent meetings of the MPC maintained the tight stance of monetary policy taking into consideration domestic developments and the potential downside effects on the US economy of the sub-prime crisis.", "The outlook is that, barring any potential shocks stemming from high oil and commodity prices, inflation will continue on its downward trend.", "An important prerequisite in the fight against inflation is for the central bank to disseminate information effectively on monetary policy issues.", "As provided in the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004, the Bank publishes a Monetary Policy Statement after each MPC meeting to explain the main assessments and findings of the MPC.", "The Statement also discloses the voting pattern of the MPC members.", "In the implementation of monetary policy, the Bank has as far as possible limited its market interventions and allowed free play of market forces.", "In the domestic foreign exchange market, the Bank intervened to sell foreign currencies for an amount of US$48.8 million to alleviate excess demand in the first two months of the year before purchasing an amount of US$252.8 million between February and April as the situation turned around and the rupee stabilised.", "With an appreciation in the rupee exchange rate of about 9.4 per cent against the US dollar from January up to November, the Bank intervened again in early December to purchase Euros 40.5 million from the market.", "In the same vein, the net foreign assets of the Bank are estimated at around Rs51 billion as at end-December, that is, an increase of some 16 per cent since the beginning of January.", "In the domestic money market, this year provided the first occasion to test the new monetary policy framework introduced in December 2006.", "To reduce excess liquidity prevailing in the system and to keep the overnight interbank interest rates within the corridor around the key Repo rate, the Bank conducted a number of reverse repos and issued some Rs14 billion of Bank of Mauritius Bills.", "As participation at the weekly auctions did not always reflect the forecast excess liquidity positions of banks, and there seemed to be a risk that the Bank's intervention would actually lead to more volatile yields, the Bank became reluctant to use reverse repos after May.", "There seemed to be a wedge between effective excessive liquidity, as showed in the bidding behaviour of banks, and liquidity levels forecast by the Bank's models.", "In an attempt to tackle this, a new facility in the form of a Special Deposit was established in November whereby banks were invited to deposit their excess funds with the Bank for a period of 14 days at a rate that was below the lower bound of the corridor.", "It is expected that further adjustments will be required in 2008 to the monetary policy framework to take into account the apparently quasi-permanent excess liquidity conditions in the domestic money market.", "In an effort to enhance market liquidity, improve the price-discovery process, and develop a more effective transmission of policy decisions, the Bank re-introduced over-the-counter sales of Bills and Treasury Notes on 24 July.", "The number of primary dealers was also increased from five to eight to spur more competition in the secondary market.", "A total of Rs306 million of Bills and Notes have been sold over the counter to date.", "For comparison, since January, Bills sold on the Stock Exchange totalled Rs118 million.", "Generally, the outcome of the measures to develop the secondary market has been fairly moderate but it constitutes a basis to build upon in the coming year.", "With a view to assisting the Bank to achieve its objectives, and given that real sector issues play an important part in monetary policy decisions, the Bank embarked in September on a series of consultations with private/real sector stakeholders to gauge their perceptions with regard to specific issues, such as the evolution of the main macroeconomic indicators, labour market developments, access to finance, and to identify the domestic and external constraints they face.", "The Bank intends to maintain regular contact with stakeholders of the real sector as we need to weigh real sector issues more adequately in our policy decisions.", "The implementation of Basel II by the March 2008 deadline constituted another major challenge for the Bank this year.", "Substantial progress was made in 2007 towards the implementation of the standardised approach to credit, market and operational risks.", "The Bank has tried to adapt the Basel II framework to the specificities of the Mauritian banking sector, which is set to benefit substantially from the new capital adequacy framework.", "The Bank adopted a collaborative approach with commercial banks for the implementation of Basel II, with working groups comprising both central bank and commercial bank Officers.", "A special Banking Committee meeting was held in September to review the implementation of Basel II by banks, which seem well poised to meet the set deadline.", "Although we are still at an early stage on this long journey, improvements in the risk management systems of banks have already been noted as the requirements of Basel II are gradually being applied by banks.", "It is expected that Basel II compliance will create the required platform for improving business decisions and increasing competitiveness in the sector.", "In this perspective, and taking into consideration changes in international accounting standards and the legal framework, the Bank has been reviewing its Guidelines to enable a more effective capture of risk management and market disclosure.", "The challenge of Basel II has necessitated the training of staff in Basel II compliance.", "The Bank has deployed the necessary resources to that effect.", "The Bank, jointly with Deutsche Bank (Mauritius) Limited, organised a training course aimed at the Bank's staff as well as staff of commercial banks on Basel II implementation.", "The Bank's staff also attended courses offered by the Financial Stability Institute and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland.", "It goes without saying that such training is on-going to ensure that our staff acquire specialised knowledge for successful implementation of Basel II.", "Still on the supervisory side, and as part of the process of promoting a more structured collaboration and co-ordination between the two domestic regulatory and supervisory bodies, a Protocole D'Accord was signed on 12 July.", "A Joint Bank of Mauritius / Financial Services Commission Co-ordination Committee was set up to activate and expand on the existing Memorandum of Understanding between the two bodies with a view to consolidating the supervision of the financial sector and harmonising the regulatory framework.", "The modernisation of the cheque-clearing system in Mauritius has reached an advanced stage, with the cheque truncation project expected to go live next year.", "Cheque truncation refers to the process by which cheques are cleared electronically without any physical movement.", "Banks can also utilise this technology to facilitate the clearing of cheques over the counter to provide a better service to their customers.", "Cheque truncation represents a paradigm shift in the processing and clearing of cheques and is a milestone in the modernisation of the cheque clearing and settlement process started in November 2002.", "Currently, it takes two days to clear a cheque after its presentation for clearing.", "Some 21,000 cheques for an amount of Rs900 million are presented for clearing every day; this gives an indication of the scope for faster and more efficient cheque clearing.", "In its endeavour to enhance credit quality in the banking sector, the Bank is progressively lowering the reporting threshold for credit facilities at the Mauritius Credit Information Bureau (MCIB).", "The threshold, which stood at Rs100,000 for individuals and Rs500,000 for corporates, was reduced to Rs25,000 for all categories in November, and as from 1 March 2008, the threshold will be abolished altogether.", "In 2008, non-bank deposit taking institutions, in particular leasing companies, the Mauritius Housing Corporation, and possibly insurance and finance companies, will be joining the MCIB to enable a wider capture of credit data for better decision-making.", "It is expected that improving overall credit quality in the financial sector will contribute to lower costs and narrow interest rate spreads, a subject of concern to us.", "As regards the MCIB itself, it should be noted that early this year, the Bank turned down the offer of a reputed rating agency to acquire the MCIB.", "During the year, the Bank has been actively setting the pace for the implementation of Islamic banking services in Mauritius so as to enrich the panoply of services already offered by the industry.", "The Banking Act 2004 was amended in August to accommodate the setting up of Islamic banking.", "In November, the Bank has been admitted as an Associate Member of the Islamic Financial Services Board, an international standard-setting organisation whose prime objective is to promote and enhance the soundness and stability of the Islamic financial services industry worldwide.", "The Bank is presently finalising the regulatory and supervisory framework that will govern institutions offering Islamic financial services.", "Existing banks can opt to offer such services through a window, or alternatively, such services could be provided through a full-fledged Islamic bank.", "Draft guidelines will be issued to the industry for consultation early next year.", "Striking the right balance between regulation, supervision and market discipline is a big challenge for all regulators.", "While overregulation may impede the development of the financial system and slow down growth, deregulation may bring about banking fragility.", "Therefore, it is also the duty of all market players to act in a responsible manner.", "The financial system of Mauritius was evaluated by the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) mission during 2007.", "A first FSAP mission that assessed the overall financial sector in February has already submitted its Aide Memoire as well as an action plan.", "A second mission conducted a thorough examination of the Anti Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework and practices in Mauritius in September/October and has already submitted its draft report.", "The recommendations of the FSAP missions should serve as a basis to foster sound development of the financial sector.", "The Bank has also received Technical Assistance missions from the IMF on Balance of Payments statistics and on the functioning of the foreign exchange market.", "In addition, a \"Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes\" mission of the IMF conducted a review of Mauritius' statistical systems and assessed its data dissemination practices against the prescriptions of the Special Data Dissemination Standards in early December.", "Following discussions with data producing agencies, and responses from data users, the mission has developed a set of recommendations designed to increase our adherence to internationally accepted statistical practices and enhance the analytical usefulness of produced statistics.", "The Bank intends to implement these recommendations early next year.", "One area where progress has been limited during the year relates to the designation of an Officer to be the Ombudsman for banks, as provided by Section 96 of the Banking Act 2004.", "According to the Act, one of the functions of the Ombudsman would be to deal with complaints against financial institutions by their customers.", "Consultations are on-going with the Commissioner for the Protection of Borrowers and the Mauritius

Sub-Regional Committee of the Association of African Central Banks (AACB) was held in Mauritius from 9 to 10 May 2007.", "On that occasion, the chairmanship of the Committee was passed on to the Bank for one year.", "The Bank has also been deeply engaged in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) committees and workshops to achieve macroeconomic convergence, among other goals.", "The Bank holds the permanent chair of the Sub-Committee of SADC Banking Supervisors.", "The relationships with other central banks in the region were further reinforced on the occasion of our 40th anniversary when the Bank had the honour to receive Governor Y.V.", "Reddy from the Reserve Bank of India and Governor P.
