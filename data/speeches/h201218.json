consumer protection; monetary policy; prudential regulation; payments, and so on - have strong interconnections with each other.", "This positions us well to understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic - including through monetary policy, macro prudential tools and supervision.", "A key priority for us is that there are suitable supports in place to help borrowers affected by income shocks caused by the pandemic and that lenders continue to seek to sustainably resolve borrowers' longer term distress.", "We have made our expectations clear on how borrowers should be treated and how lenders should engage constructively with distressed borrowers to ensure appropriate and tailored solutions to the borrower's circumstance are put in place.", "We expect all lenders to have appropriate strategies, the necessary financial and operational resources, and a suite of appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve distressed debt, whether it arose before or as a result of the pandemic.", "We are also continuing to engage with a range of stakeholders on this issue and have been listening closely to borrower representatives such that our work continues to evolve.", "The culture of firms is important in delivering our aspiration of a financial system that sustainably serves the needs of the economy and its consumers.", "The failures of the last decade or so, notably relating to the tracker mortgage scandal, demonstrate this importance and also highlight that more progress is required.", "We expect to see boards taking responsibility for the culture of their firms; overseeing product development and usage; actively promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels to improve decision-making; and ensuring robust internal systems are in place to drive effective cultures, including well developed risk management frameworks.", "Where this does not occur, we will take appropriate supervisory action and where serious or egregious breaches occur we take enforcement action.", "We are also seeking to strengthen the regulatory framework.", "We are currently working with the Department of Finance to progress the Individual Accountability Framework.", "This seeks, among other things, to enhance the accountability of senior individuals in banks.", "For the consumer and the taxpayer, safeguarding financial stability is one of the most important ways in which the Central Bank works to protect their interests -
