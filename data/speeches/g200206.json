\u2022 Sound and stable banking system; and \u2022 Modest fiscal deficit.", "Let me expound on these.", "GDP growth bounced strongly during the fourth quarter, which compensated for the weak expansion registered during the first half of the year.", "The Q4 2019 GDP outturn of 6.4 percent was driven largely by the ramping up of government spending (18.7 percent), alongside sustained robust household consumption (5.6 percent).", "Accelerated government spending was evident as public construction rose sharply by 33.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.", "On the supply side, growth was propped by the 7.9 % growth in the services sector on the back of solid expansion in public administration and defense, financial intermediation, trade, and other services.", "The industry sector also

forecast surveys of private sector analysts - have remained manageable and well within the government's target range.", "Results of the BSP's survey of private sector economists for December 2019

efficient financial system by lowering financial intermediation costs.", "Fifth, another key contributor to the 2019 growth performance was the improving external sector position of the country amid narrower trade deficit.", "The external sector remains a pillar of strength for the economy given the recorded surpluses in the balance of payments (BOP), along with a lower current account deficit in the first three quarters of 2019.", "The reversal was due to higher net receipts of trade in services, personal remittance inflows from overseas Filipinos, and sustained net inflows of foreign direct

months worth of imports.", "The sustained favorable external debt profile, demonstrated by the continued easing of the country's external debt to GDP ratio, supports the external sector position.",

large part of the country's external debt remains in medium-to-long term maturity profile supporting a manageable debt repayment schedule over the medium-to-long term horizon.", "In addition, majority of the foreign borrowings are also fixed interest rate bearing, which makes it unaffected by any future foreign exchange fluctuations.", "Seventh, the national government has ample fiscal policy space to support accelerated public investments.", "The improving fiscal position of the government, supported by the series of fiscal reforms and improved tax administration, provides the government the resources to increase public investments.", "More importantly, the push for infrastructure development is exactly what the economy needs to expand its productive capacity.", "The Philippine

frequency of natural hazards are among the key challenges confronting the economy.", "On the external front, major risks include a synchronized economic slowdown; rising geopolitical tensions; higher

Organization.", "Nonetheless, amid these risks and challenges, I am confident that the Philippine economy will remain as one of the bright spots in the region and we expect it to remain so with the support of critical structural reforms.", "After all, the positive growth story of the Philippines in the past 84 consecutive quarters was not achieved in a risk-free environment.", "The domestic
