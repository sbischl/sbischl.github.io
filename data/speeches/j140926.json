some of the remarkable features of the current global economic environment.", "Divergence in the growth paths among major economies.", "We have seen that in the US there continues to be a

two \"divergences\" have important implications for the speed and manner of global growth rebalancing and policy normalization.", "Divergence in the monetary policy stances among the AEs.", "Major central banks' policy rates have remained at historic lows.", "But while the Fed has kept the phrase \"considerable length of time\" in its statement, it raised its expectations on the future path of the target rate (i.e., those infamous dots).", "It also reiterated its exit plan - stating that depending on data developments, it could raise its target rates sooner than earlier expected.", "My sense is that the markets have taken these statements from the Fed to be of a relatively hawkish tone, and therefore USD supportive.", "Particularly so when the market would contrast these statements against: 1. the ECB action of offering liquidity directly to banks under its TLTRO (which, subsequently received only a weak take-up by banks), and, 2. the BOJ preparing for further QE.", "This apparent divergence in the monetary policy postures among AEs is not necessarily a bad situation.", "It should give you in the market some comfort that global liquidity will not be drying up anytime soon.", "In the BSP, we refer to these as \"countervailing forces\".", "But it should also give us cause to pause... as this sentiment could very well lead to the perpetuation of low volatility in the financial markets.", "For while there is disparity in the expected directions of policy among the AEs, this disparity is transpiring at very, very low levels of interest rates.", "With the forward

reasons behind Our last policy action speaks to this issue.", "Keenly aware of how our domestic market, i.e., your industry associations, is extremely reactive to US rate movements, the BSP acted \"pre-emptively\" against the expected rise in US interest rates.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I have maintained for some time now that, early, measured action is superior to belated, large, discrete

our own forecasts are also now higher.", "While most of the reasons cited for the heightened inflation expectations are due to supply side pressures, elevated expectations need to be addressed sooner rather than later.", "These could fuel second-round effects, which may be more difficult to arrest once they have set in; 4.", "To reduce the possible financial stability impact of extended periods of negative real interest rates.", "Right now because of excess liquidity in the system, the industry doesn't seem to mind much that real interest rates are negative.", "But ladies and gentlemen, when

aimed at helping you manage your own risk appetites.", "Given all these fundamental reasons for the series of BSP actions so far, what can the market expect from the BSP going forward?", "As I have always said, the BSP will remain watchful.", "We will keep our ears to the ground while we have our eyes on our price and financial stability mandate.", "And we will remain flexible to use all available tools in our now enhanced tool kit, including our strong external liquidity position.", "Validating our position of strength Indeed, in addition to: (1) a disciplined monetary policy framework, (2) a deep enhanced policy tool kit, (3) a healthy level of gross international reserves, and (4) ample monetary policy space we have built other buffers that make us confident we would be able to withstand the impact of the \"divergences\" in the external environment that I had just outlined.", "Of significance among these other buffers is our sound banking system.", "We have had

of 23.1%.", "Asset-side accounts have also increased, with Loans growing at an annual rate of 14.3% and another 10.6% for Financial Assets.", "What is most impressive is that universal and commercial banks have continuously strengthened their balance sheet for possible exigencies.", "The Capital Account of U/KBs has increased by around Php156 billion in the past 19 months, driven by improvements in Retained Earnings (Php94 billion) and Paid-In Capital (Php46 billion).", "To top it all, our U/KBs appear to be purposely leaning on the side of caution.", "The account \"Cash and Due From Banks\" has significantly increased.", "Since end 2012, U/KBs have recorded an increase of Php867 billion or a staggering annualized growth of 37%.", "Reforms: How strength can be further enhanced As these numbers validate, there is definitely every reason to believe that we are in a position of strength and finding ways to sustain it.", "This is a feather on our cap.", "But we also must be circumspect enough to accept that strength is neither absolute nor eternal.", "Financial markets continuously evolve and the same position of strength can be a marked weakness at another time and under different market circumstances.", "This is why the BSP has made it clear that we support the principles underlying the espoused global reforms.", "We believe that there is reason to the global reforms.", "But we are open to both the timing and execution of the reform details.", "Bank capital - the very core of banking supervision principles - must always have the capacity to absorb losses from risk taking behavior.", "These are no longer from your plainvanilla credit, market and operational risks.", "Instead, we need to be more cognizant of such issues as liquidity pressures, excessive leverage,

for things that we consider home-grown issues.", "It is a long wish list, and I shall not go through each of them here.", "I am fully aware that your industry associations are in constant conversation with the BSP on these topics through the BSPC.", "For all these to \"work\", we need the plumbing.", "Just like in a house, the financial markets need to have efficient plumbing.", "This is why the BSP is currently reviewing, not just Philpass, but the whole financial market infrastructure as well.", "In market infrastructure, the BSP is a vested stakeholder - for whether it is wholesale or retail payments, securities transactions or the transfer of liquidity from one account to another, the backroom of our banks must ultimately meet at PhilPass to effect final and irrevocable settlement.", "For the BSP this goes well beyond the issue of efficiency.", "For us, it is about ensuring the flow of financial transactions through the appropriate management of liquidity across financial institutions and for the system as a whole.", "Do we really need all these now?", "Ladies and gentlemen, I just went through 5 compacted slides of reforms...", "There is much that is already

crisis and the Philippines figured in several publications as among the \"most likely jurisdiction\" to fall next.", "During those years, changes were also introduced.", "Back then, the question was also raised: Do we have to do these reforms now?", "The point of the matter is that reforms are inconvenient because they introduce change and change needs to be managed.", "The strength that we see around us in the industry is the byproduct of calibrated change.", "And as the Central Monetary Authority, we have every intention to continue enabling the operating environment within the context of a pro-active culture of risk management and financial governance.", "The point, ladies and gentlemen, of all these is that the \"position of strength\" that we so cherish today is the result of reforms.", "This is the reward for introducing the facets of change that we needed, even when it was unpopular to do so.", "But in the end, it cannot be just the standards that have made a difference.", "Instead, we do recognize that the market has - to a large extent although not absolutely always - conducted itself in a prudent and professional manner.", "It is this combination of prudential governance and market conduct that has gotten us this far.", "As a community, we clearly value it.", "It is to our best interest to sustain and also find ways to enhance it.", "At the beginning of my remarks, I said I had TWO words...", "I have only given you one - DIVERGENCE.", "Let me conclude with the second word - CONVERGENCE.", "In this divergent world, where each is driven by his own bottom line considerations, we come to realize that there is no exercise that does not leave us short of breath.", "Whether it is a proactive effort or an intervention to address parochial concern, the intention to make us better requires deliberate effort.", "There is no short cut to this and there cannot be easy wins if it is longer term competitiveness that is our objective.",
