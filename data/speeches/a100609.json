rising, but not at a pace sufficient to sustain overall petroleum production.", "The idea of an oil fund was raised in the beginning of the 1980s3.", "It was intended to be a buffer fund to smooth variations in government oil revenues.", "The Act relating to the Government Petroleum Fund was adopted in 1990 in the midst of the deepest economic downturn in Norway since the Second World War.",

the name of the fund has been changed from the Government Petroleum Fund to the Government Pension fund Global.", "There are prospects that new annual transfers to the fund may be made over the next 10 years or so.", "This implies further growth in the fund, perhaps up to twice the size of today's fund, which corresponds to one and half to two times annual GDP for Norway.", "Public expenditure accounts for about half of GDP.", "Withdrawals from the fund at 4 per cent can therefore finance 15 per cent of public spending in 10 years' time.", "This can continue on a permanent basis without

generated by oil and gas production from petroleum revenue spending.", "An alternative could have been to regulate the production rate, keeping our wealth under the sea bed for a longer period, as was

the case.", "International capital markets play an important role for Norway.", "We drew on borrowing opportunities abroad when the petroleum industry was under development.", "We did the same in

billion4 in 2008, but a market reversal in 2009 has resulted in a positive return of NOK 716 billion over the past five quarters.", "So far, the fund seems to have fared relatively well through the most severe financial crisis for many decades.", "We still consider a real return of 4 per cent as realistic over time.", "This is based on the assumption that investment in sound government securities in the market can provide a reliable real return of about 21\u20442 per cent.", "At the same time, the fund can reap a return of 2 to 21\u20442 per cent in the long term from the

to emphasise that the oil fund does not stand in the way of corporate investment.", "The government can choose the composition, required rate of return and risk profile for its investments without considering the funding requirements of Norwegian enterprises.", "By the same token, Norwegian companies can choose their debt and equity structure independently of the government's financial investments.", "There is a capital market between the government as investor and corporate capital needs.", "The government's foreign savings plans do not therefore affect Norwegian companies' access to capital and required rate of return on their investments.", "There are sound arguments for investing in infrastructure, better schools and state-of-the-art research.", "But this should be possible anyway given the increase in expenditure that is provided for by the fiscal rule.", "The profitability of government investments is based on a discount rate of 4 per cent.", "This secures about the same required rate of return as the government can expect to achieve on its oil fund investments over time.", "A question that might be raised is whether there is a queue of sound and profitable projects that have to wait because of an excessively tight fiscal policy.", "It is difficult to find support for this.", "In the National Transport Plan for 2010-2019, which can perhaps be considered

calculations capture time saved and reduced costs related to accidents and the environment.", "Investment costs and future operating costs are deducted.", "The projects show a total loss of NOK 20 billion.", "There seems to be few road projects that are economically profitable.", "A rare example is the Finnfast tunnel project that connects the mainland to the beautiful island group here in Ryfylke.", "When projects cannot be expected to increase the future revenue base in society, it is important that the investments are financed from current government revenues within a long-term and sustainable framework.", "Alternatively, projects that involve a large number of users can be financed by user fees.", "A road, infrastructure or research reports for that matter can provide benefits and satisfaction over time, but they are not liquid and do not generate a flow of returns that can be used for spending.", "If the investments are made at the expense of the savings plan for the sovereign wealth fund, future generations will have to bear the cost.", "The adventures of Askeladden are often tales of success.", "Askeladden embraces every challenge and always comes out ahead.", "It is too early to draw conclusions as to how successful Norway has been in managing its oil wealth.", "In ten years or so, when petroleum production falls markedly and the oil fund is no longer increasing in size, the cost level in Norway will have to be reduced relative to other countries.", "This process may be painful, even though Norway has its own currency and a floating exchange rate.", "Our welfare state may also have become too large and the adjustment required here may also prove to be very demanding.", "Nonetheless, there are aspects of our oil wealth management that have
