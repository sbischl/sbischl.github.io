namely, Germany, Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Estonia - have fiscal space for additional discretionary measures according to the Stability and Growth Pact rules.", "What then is the way forward?", "It has been emphasized on many occasions that for countries without fiscal space, fiscal policy can still support demand by altering the composition of the budget.", "In particular, they point out that consideration should be given to cutting distortionary taxes and unproductive expenditure and increasing investments that improve total factor productivity over the medium term.", "Investment and structural reforms that increase the growth potential of the economy create fiscal space by raising future government revenues.", "It should be noted that some of these measures will require political resolve and social support as they are likely to affect social entitlements.", "Some analysts have remarked that these measures will not have much impact in the short term.", "Should there be a re-thinking of the monetary policy framework?", "In a recent blog in April 2016, Bernanke has argued that: under certain extreme circumstances - [such as] sharply deficient aggregate demand, exhausted monetary policy, and unwillingness of [fiscal authorities] to use debt-financed fiscal policies - [money-financed fiscal programs, colloquially known as helicopter drops] may be the best available alternative\" and that \"it would be premature to rule them out\".", "Earlier in this vein, in 2003, Bernanke had recommended that Japan fight deflation through an expansionary fiscal policy financed by permanent purchases of government debt by the central bank.", "The permanency of central bank purchases of public debt rules out that the new debt will ever be placed on the market, thereby eliminating Ricardian equivalence effects and preventing new public debt accumulation.", "However, an essential aspect of money-financed fiscal programs is that it involves revocation or suspension of central bank independence.", "Precisely for this reason and because governance of money-financed fiscal programs is inherently difficult (since it creates perverse incentives for legislators to facilitate tax cuts or spending when such actions no longer make macroeconomic sense), this option is not something that central banks in general are discussing or even considering.", "In the euro area, the principle of central bank independence is one of the cornerstones of the economic policy constitution enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.", "A fundamental expectation is that monetary-fiscal policy coordination will be achieved with different institutions acting independently within their mandates.", "To preserve this framework, the focus should be on improving the governance structure so as to ensure that the euro area does not gradually slide into a regime of fiscal dominance.", "Within the constraint of its given mandate, the ECB has moved towards improving the policy mix through the expansion of its balance sheet aimed at stimulating economic activity.", "It is my sincere hope that the seminar will provide a useful springboard for moving forward with bolder policy actions and reforms that will help put the Eurozone on a path of strong sustained growth and price stability."], "classifications": ["none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "fiscal dominance", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Monetary-fiscal policy coordination", "Fiscal policy", "Monetary policy", "Price stability", "Economic growth", "Fiscal space", "Sustainability", "Central bank independence", "Helicopter drops", "Governance"]}
