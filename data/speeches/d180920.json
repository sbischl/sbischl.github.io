rates.", "19 years and one transparency revolution later, the same survey earlier this year suggested around 6% of the general public had heard of the MPC.", "The failure to boost understanding of the economy and central banks among the general public helps explain why trust in central banks proved more fragile than expected after the crisis.", "It is for these reasons I have spoken about central banks facing a \"twin deficits\" problem - a deficit of public understanding and a deficit of public trust.", "These twin deficits are clearly complementary and mutually-reinforcing.", "These twin deficits have not, so far at least, had especially serious consequences for central banks.", "There has been no de-anchoring of inflation expectations.", "There has been no rolling-back of central bank responsibilities nor systematic retreat from central bank operational independence on monetary and regulatory matters.", "If anything, central banks' sets of responsibilities have recently been added to.", "At the same time, more questions are probably being asked about the role and powers of central bank than at any time in a generation.", "That is in part a reflection of the increased

may be needed to close the understanding and trust deficits and bridge the transparency and accountability gaps.", "Doing so would, I believe, leave central banks even better-informed and

example, poor levels of financial education have been shown to have large and lasting effects on individuals' health - financial, physical and mental.", "Financial illiteracy is a recipe for debt,

measures of uncertainty have been found to be important for explaining the investment behaviour of companies over time.", "David Tuckett and co-authors have constructed measures of the popular narratives used by participants in financial markets.", "They find that these narratives can play an important role in explaining asset price dynamics, over and above the impact of macro-economic fundamentals.", "In a similar spirit, the work of Michael Bailey and co-authors has found, using Facebook data, an important role for shared social narratives in explaining behaviour in the housing market.", "At a macroeconomic level, the work of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller has looked at the popular narratives which emerge during periods of boom and bust.", "Using words extracted from newspapers, they find the prevailing popular narratives about the economy have played a significant role in accounting for the heights of the peaks and depths of the troughs during macro-economic booms and busts.", "Public expectations, embedded in the stories they tell, are a key macro-economic driver.", "The common theme in all of this research is the importance of the public's \"narratives\" in shaping their - hence \"popular narratives\" - behaviour.", "That is true individually but especially collectively with shifts in collective expectations helping account for the width and depth of macro-economic fluctuations.", "As well as begun using these \"narrative\" contributing to this research, the Bank has approaches itself to help understand behaviour.", "Let me give you a topical example.", "The Bank's around the UK have a wide network of company contacts who they visit regularly to discuss the economy.", "These visits are then written up.", "These write-ups enable a semantic search to be carried out to identify the key themes or narratives emerging in companies' conversations.", "You will be unsurprised to hear that a key theme among companies over recent quarters has been uncertainty surrounding Brexit.", "Figure 1 plots a word cloud extracted from those company write-ups.", "The size of each word connotes the frequency of its use in relation to mentions of \"uncertainty\".", "For a word that did not exist as recently as five years ago, it is striking how Brexit is now dominating companies' conversations.", "Currently, it crops up 10 than

uncertainty by a factor of around 3 since the referendum.", "While mentions of Brexit have fallen from their referendum peak, it is notable that they have picked up sharply over the past few months, with measures of uncertainty following suit.", "This new research strengthens the case for improving public understanding of the economy.", "An improved understanding could result in better-informed popular narratives, and more stable expectations, among the general.", "And that, ultimately, would make for a more stable economy and financial system.", "In practice, there may be structural factors which could be acting in the opposite direction.", "The great trust shift may mean people are less willing than in the past to trust expert opinion (such as through mainstream media) and more willing to trust non-expert opinion (such as some parts of social media).", "Around half of those in the EU use social media as a news source and, among those aged 18-24 in the UK, around a quarter use it as their main news source.", "Yet we know that information from social media sources is typically filtered and personalised.", "That fits people's (personalised, localised) preferences.", "But it also results in news narratives which are more likely to be self-reinforcing and self-referential than in the past.", "The echoes in this chamber are louder, reach further, last longer.", "They are also less likely to be balanced and objective.", "More powerful, but less balanced, popular narratives are a potentially destabilising influence on expectations and the economy.", "This research points in one direction.", "The case for improved public understanding of the economy and financial system has always been strong.", "But in a world where popular narratives are even more important in driving economic behaviour, and where these narratives may be even more susceptible to destabilisation, the case for improving public understanding is significantly reinforced.", "This is one blade of the

benefits of having these new ideas and risks challenged and filtered by a group.", "The benefits of diversity arise as much from interactions within the group, as from the new ideas each person brings.", "But both are important for good ideas to emerge and for bad ideas to submerge.", "And it is this which fattens returns and slims risks, whatever the decision.", "These benefits have been demonstrated in a number of real-world settings.", "In his book The Difference, \"Diversity Trumps Ability\" theorem.", "Scott Page goes a step further with a This states that the highest-performing

that precise; it depends on the path of the economy.", "And pricing interest rates in financial markets was not the main purpose of forward guidance in the first place.", "Its purpose was to support spending in the economy by households and companies.", "That calls for shorter and simpler guidance, focussed on the broad direction and destination of interest rates.", "The MPC first used the words \"limited and gradual\" in 2014 when describing the likely future course of interest rates rises.", "It was short and simple three little words.", "It was guidance aimed squarely at households and companies, offering them an indication (but no promise) of the broad direction and destination of interest rates.", "Surveys suggest this message was understood by a majority of companies and some households.", "By allaying fears about too-rapid a rise in rates, it is likely to have encouraged spending and supported the economy.", "When the MPC did come to raise interest rates, in November 2017

communications appear to have broadened notably the reach of the MPC's monetary policy messages, in particular among a non-expert audience.", "A couple of recent research studies have used experimental methods to look more closely at the impact of the Bank's simpler communications on public understanding and trust.", "For example, in a randomised control trial of over 2,000 members of the general public, a recent study found that use of the visual summaries increased the public's understanding of the Inflation Report's messages by around 25%.", "This is a very substantial gain in public understanding for a fairly modest change in format.", "This study went, however, one step further and asked whether further improvements in understanding were making it more relatable to

public education.", "Many central banks have made efforts in this direction over a number of years, including through school visits, schools competitions and schools materials, including at the Bank of England and Bank of Estonia.", "That does not yet appear to have satiated demand from pupils and their parents, almost 80% of who say they think economics should form part of the curriculum.", "In part in response, earlier this year the Bank of England launched a new education strategy.", "There are a number of elements.", "One is a new set of schools competitions, aimed at reaching a broader range of students.", "A second is a schools ambassador programme, with Bank officials giving 200 talks in schools across the UK this year.", "We are on schedule to hit our target.", "The most ambitious part of our education strategy has been to develop classroom materials on the economy and financial system for use in schools as part of the curriculum for pupils aged 11-16.", "These go by

for school materials on economic and Bank's aim is to reach financial issues.", "We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives.", "A promising avenue would be a younger age range, say 7-11 year olds.", "This will require different materials and possibly a different approach.", "A more challenging market still would be adults, perhaps linked to existing initiatives to

distributed basis, a centralised infrastructure may be far from ideal.", "What is needed instead is a distributed architecture for engagement.", "In response, central banks have over time changed their structures and further change seems likely.", "The Bank of England has had a network of Agents around the UK for around 90 years.", "Today, the twelve regional agencies cover all corners of the UK, with an extensive network that generates around 9,000 meetings with company contacts each year.", "This is a valuable source of intelligence on the economy and financial system.", "Indeed, I would say it is increasingly valuable.", "It provides colour and context to accompany our data and models.", "It offers folk wisdom, the wisdom of the company crowd.", "But companies are only one crowd among many.", "Companies are an important lens on the economy, but far from being the only one.", "Reflecting that, the Bank has recently sought stronger connections with some other crowds, crowds with a different lens on the economy with which it has perhaps had less contact historically trades unions, charities, community organisations and the like.", "For more than a year, I have augmented those Agents' efforts with my own \"Townhall\" meetings across the UK.", "By design, these seek out the views of a wider range of citizens, in a wider range of locations on a wider range of issues around the economy and financial system than has been the case in the past.", "These events have established for me that there is wisdom in these crowds when gauging some of the key issues shaping the economy and financial system.", "The lived experience of everyday people making everyday decisions is what makes the economy tick (and sometimes tock).", "Tapping that lived experience Bank's understanding can add to the of the economy and help it when setting policy to keep the economy stable.", "There is wisdom in crowds of citizens, as there is in crowds of companies.", "The Bank is now

panel, this would give us a non-expert panel of around 300 people.", "This is edging up towards the mid-point of the Wagner/Vinaimont range and just shy of the Athenian boule.", "By using digital technology, we would aim to connect these citizen panels to allow national, as well as regional, deliberation.", "This is deliberative democracy in practice.", "As with the judicial system, it will
