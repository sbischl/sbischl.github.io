expansion of the financial sector will be constrained without the growth of the real sector.", "Thus, priority has been accorded to the productive use of bank credit to the promotion of the real sector and this demands the judicious use of credit and macro-prudential policies.", "As a competitive, efficient and healthy financial system is vital for enhancing growth, ensuring economic efficiency and maintaining macro-economic stability, a reasonable growth of the real economy is equally important to sustain the expansion of the financial services.", "In order to establish
