i.e.", "they funded high levels of investment, rather than government expenditure or private consumption.", "The second general lesson is that it has turned out to be much more complex than it seemed initially.", "Initially, the crisis was seen in relatively simple terms (President Clinton described it as \"a few little glitches in the road\").", "The belief was that exchange rates had become over-valued, these economies had run a bit faster than their productive capacities would allow, and that in some cases (most notably Thailand) the current account had blown out in a way that made them vulnerable.", "The implication was that, with exchange rates floated, they would depreciate modestly, fiscal and monetary policies could be tightened a bit in order to slow growth, and in the process current account deficits would shrink.", "There was a feeling that \"this isn't a problem; it's an opportunity\".", "At least, there was a feeling that after some short-term pain, these economies would emerge stronger than before: the crisis would provide the motivation for institutional improvement.", "These are the generalisations: let's get more specific about the things that might explain the crisis.", "The exchange rate If this was a \"currency crisis\", then exchange rates must be the key factor, mustn't they?", "There are a couple of different aspects of this that need separate discussion.", "First, did some aspect of the initial exchange rate cause the crisis?", "Secondly, what can we learn from the behaviour of exchange rates as the crisis emerged?", "First, did the exchange rate regimes cause the crisis?", "The early diagnosis was that the central problem was exchange rates which were over-valued, and fixed.", "Most commentators assess that the exchange rates were over-valued by something in the order of 10 per cent.", "We know that over-valued exchange rates are vulnerable, so this was clearly an element in the story.", "But these exchange rates are now at levels around half the starting point, or in the case of Indonesia around a quarter.", "Whatever over-valuation there was in the exchange rates at the start, markets have taken them much further in the opposite direction.", "If a 10 per cent exchange rate misalignment in one direction made these countries vulnerable to crisis, where does that leave them now?", "In short, the initial exchange rate over-valuation seems too small, too routine, and the subsequent behaviour too inexplicable, for this to carry the full weight of being the key cause.", "Were fixed rates the culprit?", "Again, fixed rates raise issues of vulnerability, but these countries did not stick to this fixed rate regime out of any perversity - they felt they needed this anchor in their macro policies.", "At the same time, some of their neighbours which have come through the crisis well also have fixed rates - Hong Kong and China.", "It might also be noted by those who believe that exchange rate flexibility would have avoided the crisis that these countries' exchange rates had been under substantial upward pressure during the first half of the 1990s.", "While the policies they pursued have clearly turned out to be unsustainable, the counter-factual - earlier introduction of floating exchange rates - might also have been a very bumpy ride.", "In short, it may be routine to refer to these as currency crises, but the exchange rate movements are symptomatic of something else.", "That said, we can learn something, in a pathological sense, about the behaviour of exchange rates from observing their behaviour in times of crisis.", "The first and most obvious lesson is that when exchange rate regimes shift from fixed to floating, the transition may be quite turbulent, and markets have some trouble establishing a sensible rate.", "It was naive to believe that a modest over-valuation would be smoothly corrected by floating.", "Even in deep, well-established markets, such as Japan and the USA, exchange rates routinely move by 30 per cent or more.", "Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of this is the degree of contagion of exchange rates.", "Just because the Thai baht moved a fair way, why did the rupiah and won have to move also (not to mention the ringgit and peso)?", "Two factors seem to be involved here.", "The first is the \"wake-up call\" argument: the fall of the baht made markets look at other currencies, and find the same matters of concern.", "The second component of the argument is that, once one exchange rate started to move, the others had to move to maintain their competitiveness.", "While we are talking about exchange rates and their extreme behaviour, I should say something about the apparent failure of high interest rates to support these exchange rates.", "Interest rates in these countries have been quite high (both in nominal and real terms) for quite a few years (in fact, this is one of the important causes of the large capital inflows).", "When the crisis arrived, interest rates were put even higher.", "This was appropriate, but what is clear is that they were not put high enough to prevent the depreciation over-shooting.", "Some argue that the only thing that went wrong here was that the authorities were not prepared to put them high enough to do the job.", "There is, however, another side to this story.", "Briefly: extremely high interest rates are not credible: markets expect them to be abandoned quickly; the foreign debt was foreign currency denominated, and higher domestic interest rates would have made foreign creditors even more nervous about the credit risks they faced, and therefore more likely to withdraw their money; very high interest rates raise problems of adverse selection - the only borrowers are those who do not intend to repay.", "Current account deficits and capital flows The large current account deficits incurred by these countries are now seen to have been a major source of vulnerability.", "We noted earlier that these were \"good\" deficits, and in defence of Korea and Indonesia, it should also be noted that neither was running a particularly large deficit over recent years (for Korea 2 per cent of GDP in 1990-96, and 3 per cent for Indonesia).", "But Thailand certainly was - around 8 per cent of GDP.", "What is very clear, ex post, is the vulnerability to extraordinary reversals of capital flows (which we have not, for example, seen in Australia).", "The inflow into these countries was around US$ 40 billion in 1995, more than doubled to nearly US$ 100 billion in 1996, and reversed to an outflow of around US$ 12 billion in 1997.", "It is hardly surprising that a major adjustment is underway in these countries, to adapt to this reversal.", "Before we condemn current account deficits as a manifestation of misguided policies, we should note that these deficits were not only \"good\" (in the sense that they funded investment, not consumption), but were - to a very large degree - the normal working through of market processes.", "These countries experienced very high productivity growth as technology was brought to bear, combined with low labour costs.", "They \"got their act together\" and provided a hospitable environment for commerce and investment.", "It is hardly surprising that there has been, over time, a significant flow of capital from the \"old\" high-saving countries to the \"new\" investment opportunities in East Asia.", "If there was an economic miracle taking place, foreign investors wanted a slice of the action.", "The fast-developing financial infrastructure provided the conduit between domestic borrowers and foreign savers.", "There is, in fact, an earlier example of this.", "Singapore went for two decades with a current account deficit averaging more than 10 per cent of GDP, and most people look back on this era as an extraordinary success.", "In short, if we can identify a critical problem here, it is the potential for reversal of the capital flow, rather than the current account deficit per se.", "This was, of course, exacerbated by two characteristics of the capital flows - their short-term nature and the foreign currency denomination of the debt.", "These were seen, at the time, as natural-enough characteristics of the institutional structure:7 to interfere would be to go against the tide of market-oriented policies.", "But we can now identify them as major sources of vulnerability.", "The financial sector A third key weakness, which was identified early on,9 is that fast-growing financial sectors are very vulnerable, because they inevitably reflect lack of experience, by the commercial bankers, borrowers and prudential supervisors.", "Just as a rapidly-growing balance sheet is a warning sign for an individual financial institution, the same warning signs existed in these countries.", "But even this was hard to foresee as a devastating problem.", "As a country moves away from under-developed financial \"repression\",10 it is both inevitable and desirable that the depth of the financial sector increases - i.e.", "the balance sheets of financial institutions expand faster than nominal GDP.", "That said, of course there is an issue of \"how much faster\"?", "Less excusable are the inadequate efforts to put in place effective prudential supervision.", "Coincidence and compounding I have argued, so far, that none of the elements which are usually put forward is, in itself, all that unusual, or enough to explain the extent of the crisis.", "The fatal flaw was the combination.", "To some extent, the problems were self-reinforcing - when one weak link broke, this put more pressure on other linkages, which collapsed under the extra burden placed on them.", "But it is by no means inevitable that these problems should coincide - I would simply note that Australia in the mid 1980s had an exchange rate fall of the magnitude of Thailand's and Korea's without a major crisis, and had an asset price bust of probably the same order of magnitude (in the late 1980s) without this degree of damage.", "The bumpy international environment made the capital flows more volatile, and help to explain both the exchange rate appreciations and the variation in capital flows.", "The yen/dollar exchange rate moved 20 per cent in the year beginning April 1996, affecting these countries' effective exchange rates, their trade and their capital flows.", "Low Japanese interest rates initially encouraged excess liquidity to flow to these countries, which reversed when markets began to focus on possible interest rate increases.", "An analogy might illustrate the point about compounding causation: in a car crash, who or what is to blame for the injuries?", "Is it speed, some act of recklessness such as intoxication, a poor road surface, an under-inflated tyre, an inadequate guard-rail, a poorly-designed car, or inadequate seat-belts?", "Some of these things are mutually compounding, and others are simply unable to cope with the abnormal strains to which they are subject.", "So it is with the Asian \"currency\" crisis.", "The search for a single key cause - and, by implication, a single key solution to prevent recurrence - will miss the complexity of the task ahead.", "That said, there are clear linkages between the fault lines, and in the Asian case, there was a conjuncture of problems.", "Large capital inflows led, more-or-less inevitably, to excessive credit growth and growth of the financial sector, because it was not possible to sterilise them fully.", "The large flows meant, also, that there was easy funding available for projects (both good and bad), and that asset prices were bid up.", "Similarly, the large capital flows made it difficult to raise interest rates higher (they were already quite high), for fear of inducing even more capital inflow.", "High domestic interest rates, at the same time, persuaded many borrowers to take the risk of tapping into attractively lower foreign currency-denominated borrowing.", "Further, with quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes in these countries, there was little incentive for institutions borrowing in foreign currencies to hedge their debt.", "These issues should have been recognised as sources of vulnerability, but the focus was on growth, without enough concern about resilience in the face of variance in growth.", "This failure to recognise the interaction of elements was a key misunderstanding as the crisis broke.", "With hindsight, it should have been realised that simply freeing the exchange rates would cause them to shift a fair way and this would create enormous problems for a financial sector weighed down by bad debts and large foreign currency-denominated debt.", "This would, in turn, feed back into the exchange rate.", "If we were to identify the crucial combination, it would be the large volatile foreign capital flows, plus fragile financial sectors.", "These two factors, in combination, made these economies extremely vulnerable to changes of confidence.", "We have in our minds financial markets which are constantly digesting and evaluating information to produce a price - an exchange rate - which reflects the \"fundamentals\".", "But we see, here, that the more nebulous concept of \"confidence\", at times, dominates the fundamentals.", "\"In a matter of just a few months, the Asian economies went from being the darlings of the investment community to being virtual pariahs.", "There was a touch of the absurd in the unfolding drama, as international money managers harshly castigated the very same Asian governments they were praising just months before.", "But, as often happens in financial markets, euphoria turned to panic without missing a beat.", "Suddenly, Asia's leaders could do no right.", "\"12 This is not, of course, the first time this has happened.", "Alan Greenspan, describing this reaction in capital flows as \"a visceral, engulfing, fear\", went on to say \"The exchange rate changes appear the consequences, not of the accumulation of new knowledge of a deterioration in fundamentals, but of its opposite: the onset of uncertainties that destroy previous understandings of the way the world works.", "That has induced massive disengagements of investors and declines in Asian currencies that have no tie to reality.", "In all aspects of life, when confronted with uncertainty, people tend to withdraw.", "... At one point the economic system appears stable, the next it behaves as though a dam has reached a breaking point, and water (read, confidence) evacuates its reservoir.", "The United States experienced such a sudden change with the decline in stock prices of more than 20 per cent on October 19, 1987.", "There is no credible scenario that can readily explain so abrupt a change in the fundamentals of long-term valuation on that one day.", "Such market panic does not appear to reflect a simple continuum from the immediately previous period.\"", "Krugman (1998a) has suggested a possible reason for this big shift in confidence.", "Foreign investors thought they were working in a riskless world, and made their investment decisions accordingly.", "Then, quite suddenly, they realised the risk, and underwent a fundamental adjustment in expectations.", "This explanation has some attractions but does not seem to fit the overall reality closely.", "There were not too many explicit guarantees around, leaving aside bank and sovereign debt (which remained guaranteed), so there was not a rational reason for re-evaluation.", "The more intuitively appealing explanation (at least to me) is that investors simply changed their minds.", "They had not known much about the countries (or projects) they invested in to start with, so there was lots of opportunity for them to shift between exuberance and deep pessimism, either based on a modest accretion of news on fundamentals or, more likely, on the basis of what their colleagues in the market were doing.", "Correlated shifts in expectations are the key to understanding what happened.", "The fundamentals (such as when a thing gets cheaper, people buy more of it) were overwhelmed by something akin to panic - if everyone is running in one direction, we should run too (because it becomes increasingly costly not to).", "Of course, once the mood had changed, commentators and investors alike found much in these economies that they did not like, particularly issues which come under the broad rubric of \"governance\".", "There are two relevant time horizons here - what should be done, in the form of \"battle-field dressing\", to cope with the crisis and get these economies back on the rails again?", "Then, in the longer term, what can be done to make them less vulnerable in the face of future problems?", "Early on it was recognised that these crises had many of the characteristics of an old-fashioned banking liquidity crisis - a \"bank run\".", "There had been a massive loss of confidence and withdrawal of money, so what was required - reaching back into the 19th century prescription of Bagehot - was: \"lend freely, but at a penalty rate\".", "The \"withdrawal\" took the form of capital outflow from the country, rather than a domestic shift of funds, but the principle was the same.", "This was, indeed, the diagnosis and the prescription in Mexico in 1995, and most people, with hindsight, regard this as an overall success.", "(More on Mexico in a moment.)", "While this is clear enough in principle, making it operational presents problems.", "The most prominent of these has been concern about \"moral hazard\".", "Moral hazard arises \"when someone can reap the rewards from their actions when things go well but not suffer the full consequences when things go badly\"13.", "In the Asian policy debate, there were lots of left-over arguments from the 1995 Mexican episode, with some arguing that the US$ 50 billion IMF/USA bail-out had been unduly beneficial to fund management institutions, particularly in the USA.", "It has to be acknowledged that all types of insurance have significant elements of moral hazard, and the issue is not to avoid doing anything involving moral hazard, but how to keep it in check.", "The idea that Asian creditors have, in general, been protected is wrong.", "The problem is a narrower one than is usually posed - applying specifically to government debt and bank debt - the first because of its sovereign nature, and the second because of the systemic implications of widespread bank failure.", "In these cases, it is difficult to avoid a degree of \"bailing out\", and it is just as difficult to expect investors to ignore this.", "We will examine, in a moment, what might be done to address moral hazard issues in the longer term.", "But meanwhile, with the crisis on us, moral hazard should not be used as the all-encompassing excuse for inaction.", "Bagehot's prescription worked reasonably well in Mexico, but has not been applied with the same speed and vigour in Asia.", "What about the longer-term reforms?", "Given that the damaging combination seems to have been big foreign capital flows plus fragile financial sectors, this is the place to begin.", "Longer-term reform must include the building of resilient financial sectors, which can withstand substantial shifts in sentiment, and big changes in the exchange rate.", "Part-and-parcel of prudential measures would be to discourage the sort of short-term and foreign currency exposures which occurred, and where they occur in the private commercial sector, to insulate the banks from them.", "A well-functioning banking sector might also act as the stable core of the financial sector which would, to some extent, act as the \"guardian on the gateway to investment\".", "For this to be possible, banks need not only to be well staffed by people with real business experience, but need to be free from the pressures of \"connected\" or \"command\" lending pressures, which have been all-too-apparent in these countries in the past.", "The difficulties with moral hazard have to be acknowledged, and the crises dealt with in ways that ensure that those who were involved in failed investments are financially penalised.", "But if, when all other measures are taken to improve transparency and disclosure, these international capital flows remain flighty and volatile, even those who are searching for market purity will have to either accept restrictions on such flows, or the existence of some lender-of-last-resort.", "The damaging externalities of the reversal of these capital flows cannot simply be left to run their course, with markets \"sorting it out\" in the way we are observing currently in Asia.", "No-one has yet come up with any clever ideas on how to back up the international lender-of-last-resort by prudential rules to address the moral hazard problem.", "Just as disclosure is an important part of any prudential framework, it will have a role to play -

US$ 81\u20442 billion; Korea - US$ 13 billion; and Indonesia - US$ 3 billion.", "one reason why Mexico received a quick disbursement of assistance to offset the capital flight was the nature of the foreign debt.", "It was largely sovereign debt (Tesobonos), and there was little debate (at least beforehand) that it should be paid out in full.", "The USA/IMF money made this possible.", "When it came to Asia, none of the short-term debt was sovereign, so there was, initially, no specific plan to pay it off.", "The hope was that the announcement of the packages would, itself, instil new confidence so that creditors would roll over their debt;20 these countries may well be headed for the same sorts of negative growth rates that Mexico faced in the first year after the crisis.", "If so, the deceleration in the growth rate is significantly greater, because Mexico had been growing at around 3-4 per cent, whereas these countries grew at 7-8 per cent; Mexico had the advantage of being next to the large and growing US market, whereas Asia's crisis comes at a time when the US growth is at the mature phase of the cycle, and Japan is still stagnant; \u2022 as in Mexico, these countries have very quickly (almost immediately) corrected their current account deficits, by reductions in imports stemming largely from the slowing of GDP; Mexico began with a much more clearly over-valued exchange rate; if Asian exchange rates do not recover, these countries seem headed for very substantial inflation (particularly Indonesia).", "Mexico was probably more able to handle this, as it had had plenty of recent experience with inflation.", "The Asian countries have had relative price stability for many the unfinished business of rescuing the financial systems of Thailand and Indonesia have already absorbed the sorts of money Mexico used to support its financial sector (i.e.", "more than 10 per cent of GDP), and they are \"still counting\".", "This is neither surprising (in Scandinavia, something around 6-8 per cent of GDP was used, and even in the relatively minor case of the American S&Ls, something like 2 per cent of GDP was required), nor is this particularly alarming -

like so many other miracles - turns out to be some sleight of hand, or not sustainable over time.", "One of the original sceptics of the miracle - Paul Krugman - might seem vindicated in his likening of these countries to the early years of the Soviet Union, where fast growth was achieved artificially and in a way that could not be sustained in the longer run.", "Even among the countries themselves, the basis of the miracle - free markets and increasing exposure to the outside world - is now under serious question.", "In the face of these doubts and the current crisis, should we abandon this new paradigm and return to some version of the old, low-growth, view of these countries?", "The most powerful reason for not doing this is that the forces which drove growth in the past are still there - the poorer of these countries are still well back from the technological frontier and the application of capital to still-cheap labour, and improvements in organisation and governance mean that fast growth is still achievable.", "The fact that they are still relatively poor makes this eminently desirable.", "First priority is to get them back on the rails again.", "Second priority, when the immediate crisis is over, is to get along with those structural and governance issues that we have heard so much about of late.", "If they are as economically important as the current debate implies, the growth potential of these countries should be higher still.", "The countries which can put in place robust, resilient and responsive financial sectors most quickly will be the ones which can return to rapid growth first.", "Horioka (1980), 'Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows', Economic Journal, June, Vol.", "Garnaut, R.
