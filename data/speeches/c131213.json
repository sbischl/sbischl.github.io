alongside quantitative easing in other countries - could lead to a similar outcome.", "Their fear is that all that money creation is eventually going to result in an explosion in inflation.", "The situation now is different from the early 1970s.", "Monetary stimulus today is offsetting the serious and still ongoing downside shocks resulting from the crisis.", "Of course, it is worth asking what will happen when those negative forces abate.", "Could all that additional liquidity fuel inflation then?", "My answer is: central banks will need to drain that extra liquidity from the system at some point, as the economy heals.", "While I don't want to underestimate the challenge of getting that exit exactly right, I am confident that we have the ability to keep inflation from taking off.", "In short, we will remain vigilant.", "We are prepared to remove monetary stimulus when it's no longer needed to offset the forces that currently are pulling inflation below target.", "But, right now, it looks to us like it will take around two years to get inflation back up to 2 per cent.", "Let's switch gears and look at the risk of outright deflation.", "Like out-of-control inflation, deflation can become a spiral, but a downward one.", "Expectations become unanchored on the downside, and people put off their purchases because they expect things to be less expensive later.", "Demand declines with prices, while the weight of debt on the economy grows.", "In the Great Depression, consumer prices in Canada fell 25 per cent, and national output dropped by almost a third.", "The human cost was staggering, with unemployment reaching 20 per cent.", "A milder form of deflationary trap has nagged Japan for the past 20 years.", "What I am describing is an economy-wide process of deflation, which is quite different from individual prices falling because of improved competitiveness in an economy that is still growing strongly.", "Today, the concern is that even though policy-makers were successful in avoiding global deflation in the wake of the 2008 crisis, there is still a risk that inflation could creep down into deflationary territory as the aftershocks of this crisis persist.", "It is, at least in part, to counter that risk that central banks in a number of countries have kept interest rates very low and used unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, to provide additional stimulus to their economies.", "History has taught us that deflation usually comes in the wake of a financial crisis.", "This was true of the Great Depression, and of the Japanese deflation of the 1990s.", "Perhaps the most important lesson of the crisis, then, is that a stable financial system is necessary to keep inflation low, stable and predictable -

as was our experience in the early 1980s, when we tackled runaway inflation.", "Credibility must be employed wisely.", "We think of it as an investment.", "By using credibility to exercise the framework's flexibility, we are working to maintain stable financial conditions that will support the expansion of capacity and return the economy to its full potential.", "As the process unfolds, we anticipate there will be a future payoff of enhanced credibility.", "As we decide policy, we cannot take credibility for granted; we must keep earning it by ensuring, first and foremost, that monetary policy remains focused on keeping inflation on target.", "I've described how we manage a menu of risks in our policy decisions: We look at risks through two lenses.", "We are concerned with the big risks of runaway inflation and deflation and are acting to keep them remote.", "We have learned, the hard way, that financial stability is a necessary condition for low and stable inflation, and we are working here in Canada and around the world to improve the resilience of the financial system.", "Our current monetary policy balances the risk that inflation could drift even further below target against the risks of exacerbating financial system imbalances.", "As central bankers, here in Canada and globally, we are in new territory.", "It brings to mind the sailors of another era who were driven far off course by a nasty storm.", "When things calmed, they found themselves in the southern hemisphere.", "Suddenly the navigational chart that they relied on - the night sky - was completely different.", "We have every reason to believe that, after the experience of the crisis is behind us, central banking will be defined very differently than it was just five years ago.", "We know now that economic and financial stability are intrinsically linked, and we are figuring out as we go how to better integrate the two in our analysis and research, and in our policy.", "On a technical level, we are actively building new models and adding new detail to our existing ones.", "We are spending more time talking to real people making real economic decisions, to understand better the forces we are facing.", "And, we are communicating differently, not just more, but with more transparency, with due regard to the uncertainty around us.", "I am confident that we've got it roughly right, given what we know and especially what we don't.", "Just like those sailors on the open seas, we will adapt and thrive -
