until the fall of 2008 - rather benign macroeconomic environment, rising property prices, high credit growth and a low saving ratio posed a policy challenge - as in many countries.", "A high leverage ratio makes the financial system, and in effect the whole economy, more sensitive to fluctuating asset prices.", "The present downturn in Norway was not triggered by moving asset prices, but rather by the international downturn.", "Still, the effect of the international downturn on our economy is probably stronger than it would have been with a better regulatory framework.", "A consensus is emerging internationally that new tools are needed in order to make the financial system more robust with respect to macroeconomic fluctuations.", "Moreover, the financial system should help dampen rather than amplify or even cause fluctuations.", "The new tools -
