second, demographics; and third, diverging developments in the returns on risky and safe financial assets.", "These three factors are embedded in the textbook economic growth model, which relates the equilibrium rate of interest to economic growth, population growth and the discount rate.", "I will primarily focus on common international trends, even if cross-country differences in these driving forces have important implications for return differentials and international capital flows.,[5] The potential growth rate One fundamental driver of r* is the potential growth rate of the economy: in a high-growth economy, it takes a higher real interest rate to encourage the volume of saving required for the high investment levels needed to sustain a fast-growing economy.", "Although easier to see with the benefit of hindsight, there has been a sustained decline in the potential growth rate of advanced economies in recent decades: it is estimated to be less than half of what it was 50 years ago (Chart 2).", "This pattern also carries over to expectations about future growth performance.", "The decline in potential output growth in turn can be attributed to a decline in total factor productivity growth (Chart 3) and a corresponding decline in labour productivity growth (Chart 4).", "Potential output growth and long-term growth expectations Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, European Commission and Consensus Economics.", "Notes: The euro area data reflect the changing composition of Member States.", "The Consensus long-term growth estimates are for years t+6 to t+10.", "The first observation for Consensus long-term growth expectations is 1999 for the euro area and 1990 for the United States.", "Latest observation: 2021 for euro area potential output growth estimates, 2019 for all other series.", "Total factor productivity growth (yearly growth rates, percentages, five-year moving averages, constant prices) Sources: European Commission AMECO database and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: The euro area reflects data for the original 12 member states.", "Latest observation: 2018.", "Labour productivity: real gross value added per person employed Sources: European Commission AMECO database and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: The euro area reflects data for the original twelve Member States.", "Latest observation: 2018.", "A range of inter-related structural and technological factors have been advanced to explain the decline in the potential output growth rate.", "Assessing the determinants of the rate of technological innovation is beyond the scope of this speech.", "In addition to the pace of frontier innovation, aggregate productivity growth also depends on the rate of technology diffusion.", "There are signs that the diffusion rate has slowed: for instance, the gap between the labour productivity growth of firms operating at the technology frontier in a given sector and that of firms that are lagging behind the technology frontier in that sector (non-frontier firms) has increased over time (Chart 5).", "This pattern is even more pronounced in the services sector than in manufacturing.", "Technology diffusion in manufacturing and services in the OECD and selected euro area (annual labour productivity growth of frontier and non-frontier firms;
