strengthening our economy in the months ahead and to a sustained expansion over the medium term.", "So let me now briefly discuss the Bank's views on the economy and inflation.", "The current economic situation Since our Monetary Policy Report Update in July, inflation pressures in Canada have continued to ease.", "Part of the recent decline in inflation has come from an increase in the amount of slack in the economy.", "The pace of growth in the second quarter of this year was interrupted by a number of near-term factors, especially SARS and trade restrictions on Canadian exports of cattle and beef because of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).", "Growth in the third quarter will also likely remain below the economy's potential because of the remaining trade restrictions on beef and cattle, as well as the effects of the power blackout in Ontario and of forest fires in Western Canada.", "The prices of some services have been temporarily depressed by SARS.", "In addition, there has been a greater-than-anticipated reduction in the prices of a number of goods, such as motor vehicles, clothing, and household furniture and appliances.", "We had expected our core rate of inflation - which strips out the eight most volatile components of the consumer price index, as well as the effect of changes in indirect taxes on the remaining components - to decline below the 2 per cent target.", "In fact, that happened earlier than the Bank had anticipated.", "Our core inflation measure is likely to decline somewhat further in the next few months.", "And we see the trend of inflation remaining below the 2 per cent target for some time.", "As I've said, part of this lower trend in inflation is a result of the slack in the economy that has opened up in 2003.", "In addition, prices of many traded goods have fallen worldwide because of excess supply.", "The rise in the Canadian dollar earlier this year pulled down the price of imported goods, and some retailers have passed on these savings to consumers.", "As well, vendors are lowering prices to clear their inventory, especially in the automobile sector.", "Price pressures that we saw from higher insurance premiums earlier this year appear to be dissipating as the year progresses.", "The total CPI inflation rate has come down from 4.6 per cent in February to 2.2 per cent recently, because of the decline in core inflation and because of smaller increases in energy prices.", "Swings in energy prices remain a risk to our total inflation outlook in the months ahead, although we assume oil prices of about US$27 per barrel in 2004.", "Notwithstanding the temporary factors that have affected the economy in the second and third quarters of this year, we see indications that the conditions are in place for stronger economic growth.", "Growth of final domestic demand has remained robust, and the adverse effects of the shocks that I just mentioned are beginning to dissipate.", "The economic rebound in the United States began earlier, and will be stronger, than previously expected.", "More robust consumer demand and strengthening business investment in the United States should augur well for Canadian exports.", "We are also seeing a strengthening trend in Asia.", "As well, the tone of capital markets remains favourable.", "So, despite current weakness, the accumulation of economic evidence to date reinforces the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004.", "Last week, we lowered our target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point, to 2 3/4 per cent.", "With this decision, policy interest rates will support the return to levels of economic activity that are consistent with an overall balance between supply and demand in the economy.", "Achieving that balance will work to return inflation to the target over the medium term.", "Canadians have been through a lot this year.", "But each shock also represented an opportunity - to learn, to improve our ability to handle a crisis, and to strengthen our sense of community.", "No one can predict what kind of shocks our economy will face in the future, but we know that shocks will occur.", "What's important is that we have a robust economic and financial framework that allows us to deal with those disturbances and to seize opportunities as they arise.", "It is that strong framework that gives businesses and investors the confidence to take risks and to innovate.", "We are making progress in building the framework that supports the confidence dividend.", "During the 1990s, we improved our fiscal and monetary policies.", "Now, as I have described, we're working to make our financial systems more robust and efficient.", "These continuing efforts promote confidence.", "They improve our ability to withstand all types of economic shocks and to capitalize on opportunities."],
