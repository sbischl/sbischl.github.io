investment has increased by about 15 points; the number of those in employment, which has risen by more than 1 million, has hit an all-time high.", "The productive fabric of the country has strengthened, especially in the export sector; the difficulties encountered by the banking system have been alleviated with the improvement in the real economy and the reduction in non-performing loans; the balance of payments has recorded a current account surplus since 2013;
