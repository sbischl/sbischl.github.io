employees to perform daily banking activities.", "Among other benefits of online banking and IBG is that, it offers faster movement of funds compared to payment using cheques.", "For example, the transfer of funds through IBG performed before noon allows a person to receive the funds within the same day compared to cheques that will take a couple of days to three days.", "For a beneficiary who has an account within the same bank with the payer, which is known as Intrabank, the funds will be credited instantaneously.", "The program for today includes the showing of three video clips on

is much higher than 3.9 in advanced countries such as Norway, Finland and Australia.", "It is also worth noting that 92% (or 18.4 million) of the total adult population in Malaysia have banking accounts and of these, about 74% (13.7 million) of bank account holders have Internet banking accounts.", "However, although 74% of the bank account holders have Internet banking access, only 43% (5.9 million) of the Internet banking subscribers are active users in conducting financial transactions.", "In this regard, we have not reached a stage where the masses are familiar or have gained sufficient trust in using Internet banking to conduct their financial transactions.", "It is through educational programs such as this roadshow event that we hope the businesses will take the

transaction fee for IBG conducted via Internet and mobile banking has been reduced from RM2 to 10 sen with effect from 2 May 2013.", "This is to give the public and businesses an 11 month head-start to adopt e-payments before the cheque processing fee of 50 sen is imposed on 1 April 2014.", "The adjustment to the IBG and cheque prices is to align them closer to their cost of production.", "The actual cost of production is about RM3 per cheque and currently consumers pay only 15 sen for the stamp duty per cheque leaf.", "The 11 months delay in the increase in cheque fee was intentional to allow the public and businesses to familiarize themselves with the use of online banking to conduct e-payment transaction.", "In this regard, banking institutions have given their commitment to

(2,121) kiosks have been deployed in 74% of the 2,341 bank branches and it is expected that almost all bank branches will be equipped with the Internet kiosk by end March 2014.", "In addition, the banking industry has developed a framework on payment reference standard that will enable payers to indicate payment transaction details to allow beneficiaries to easily identify the source and purpose of payment and this will facilitate more efficient reconciliation process through e-payments.", "Finally, I would once again like to emphasize that IBG via Internet banking and mobile banking provides significant benefits to the businesses by having the convenience of transacting anytime, anywhere.", "It also lowers the costs of doing business through reduction of cash and cheque handling costs and redeployment of resources for more productive activities.", "In closing, I wish you an insightful and productive engagement at this roadshow event and trust that the discussions today will
