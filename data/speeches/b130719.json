that it is difficult to detect signs of pressure building up in the system in real time, that the financial sector can contain pressure for a longer time than we think possible, and as a consequence, when the inevitable implosion takes place, it can be quite disastrous, or even catastrophic.", "We learnt that it is difficult to predict the precise nature of the implosion.", "For example, in the pre-crisis years, even the few who sensed stress building up in the system, thought there would be a currency crisis; in the event the implosion took the form of a financial sector crisis.", "There were other lessons too.", "That a collection of rational financial institutions does not necessarily make a rational financial sector.", "In other words, rational behaviour at the individual institutional level does not aggregate to collective rationality because of the fallacy of composition.", "Financial institutions are notoriously prone to herd behaviour.", "They have a strong collective tendency to over expose themselves to the same type of risk during an upturn, and become overly risk averse during a downturn which can lead the whole system on a downward spiral of risk aversion, market seizure and instability.", "These lessons from the crisis have triggered a vigorous debate on whether financial stability should be made an explicit mandate of central banks.", "There are powerful arguments for why central banks should be at the centre of safeguarding financial stability.", "Let me list a few important ones.", "(i) Generally, monetary policy and financial stability are mutually supportive.", "This interdependency between the two dimensions suggests that the central bank, with inherent responsibility for monetary policy, should also be entrusted the responsibility for financial stability so that it can take a holistic view of policy options by factoring in costs and benefits in both dimensions.", "(ii) That the central bank should have the responsibility for monetary policy is unquestioned.", "Because banks are the conduits through which monetary policy decisions are transmitted to the real economy, it is synergistic to entrust the responsibility for microprudential supervision of banks also to the central bank.", "And if the central bank is the microprudential supervisor, there is a strong case for it to have responsibility for regulation of systemic risk at the macro level.", "(iii) By far the strongest argument in favour of entrusting the financial stability responsibility to the central bank is that it is unquestionably the lender of last resort (LoLR) for the financial system.", "A central bank can discharge its LoLR function more efficiently if its mandate extends beyond merely monitoring financial institutions to taking preventive action.", "This becomes possible if the central bank is also in charge of financial stability.", "On the issue of financial stability, even as the lessons of the crisis are clear, the policy responses to those lessons are not yet clear.", "There are some common trends, but there are also variations across countries on the precise manner in which they are redesigning their regulatory architectures, the additional responsibilities they are assigning to their central banks and the coordination bodies that they are setting up.", "Are the concerns of EMEs in regard to financial stability any different from those of advanced economies?", "Admittedly, financial instability is costly everywhere, including in EMEs.", "Indeed, financial stability is a necessary pre-condition for securing growth.", "Nevertheless, the cost-benefit calculus for EMEs of tighter regulation in order to safeguard financial stability can be quite different from that of advanced economies.", "This is because EMEs are in a higher growth phase with higher credit elasticity of GDP than advanced economies.", "Increase in the cost of credit on account of tighter regulation can inhibit their pace of growth.", "EMEs therefore need to strike the right balance between preventing financial instability and supporting growth.", "Experience shows that managing this challenge is more a question of good judgement than analytical skill.", "V. Communication as a central bank policy tool opportunities and risks 47.", "Hours after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the US Federal Reserve put out a two sentence statement: \"The Federal Reserve System is open and operating.", "The discount window is open to meet liquidity needs.\"", "Those two seemingly banal sentences had a remarkable calming effect on the US, and by extension, on the global financial markets.", "The \"announcement effect\" was simply stunning.", "Again Mario Draghi's famous words that the ECB will do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro prevented, more than anything else, what many thought was an imminent collapse of the euro.", "Both the above are emphatic examples of the potency of central bank communication.", "Given this power, one would have thought that central banks would have more actively resorted to communication as a vehicle to further their policy objectives.", "On the contrary, they used to be quite reticent, believing that their policies must speak for themselves, and that any overt attempt to communicate could be misleading or distortionary.", "Over the last two decades, however, this overly rigid attitude has gradually yielded to open and transparent communication as central banks have come to realize its positive impact.", "This shift in central bank theology from deliberate obscurity to greater transparency actually reflects a shift in the theory of monetary policy.", "Up until the early 1990s, monetary policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas' argument that monetary policy affected real variables, like growth, only if the policy changes were unanticipated.", "This encouraged obscurity over openness and clarity.", "However, lost in the message was that monetary policy always affected nominal variables like inflation even if fully anticipated.", "In the 1980s, two economists, also Nobel winners, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott, argued that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary policy changes were more efficient and credible.", "This was the beginning of the push towards rules over discretion and greater central bank transparency.", "The most eloquent illustration of this shift towards transparency is the change in the communication strategy of the US Fed.", "Hard as it might be to imagine from today's perspective, prior to 1994, the US Fed was not even announcing the target Fed Funds Rate; the market was expected to infer the rate from the timing, sequencing and magnitude of its open market operations.", "In sharp contrast, today the Fed not only announces the rate but also gives a clear indication of future policy trajectory.", "Indeed, it is standard practice for central banks these days to indicate the policy rates, the rationale behind the policy action, the expected outcomes, and oftentimes forward guidance on future policy actions.", "Sometimes, instead of being a vehicle for policy, communication can be the policy itself.", "This issue came into sharp focus in the debate surrounding the quantitative easing (QE) policies of the US Federal Reserve.", "Against the QE policies, there is an influential view that after the policy interest rate has been brought to the zero lower bound, nothing else needs to be done except for the central bank to say that it will keep interest rates low in the future too.", "It is argued that this communication, just by itself, would encourage people to borrow more and spend, bailing the economy out of recession.", "But this idea of topping up monetary easing with communication may not always work.", "People may not believe that the central bank will keep its promise of low interest rates.", "Even if they believe the central bank, they may not still borrow since what they may be trying to do is to get out of debt rather than get into further debt as is the case today.", "So, how do central banks improve their credibility?", "By tying their promise of low interest rates to specific quantitative real sector variables?", "The US Federal Reserve has recently led the way in this direction by saying that it will keep interest rates low as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 per cent, and in the process, is willing to tolerate inflation slightly above its long-run target.", "Another way of reinforcing this promise of low interest rates is the idea of shifting from targeting inflation to targeting nominal GDP.", "Is communication an equally potent policy tool for EME central banks?", "How effectively are they using communication as a policy tool?", "Although I have not made an exhaustive study, it would be fairly accurate to say that they too are learning to use communication constructively, both as a vehicle for policy and sometimes as the policy itself.", "Let me give an illustration from the crisis period.", "In the pre-crisis years, it was intellectually fashionable to subscribe to the \"decoupling\" hypothesis which held that even if advanced economies went into a downturn, EMEs would not be affected because of their improved policy framework, robust external reserves and resilient banking systems.", "Yet the crisis affected virtually all EMEs, denting the credibility of the decoupling hypothesis.", "EME central banks found that transparently communicating why and how they were affected by the crisis, notwithstanding the decoupling hypothesis, actually helped assuage concerns and revive market confidence.", "In the post-crisis period, the major way in which EME central banks have used communication is in giving forward guidance on monetary policy.", "In the Reserve Bank too, we have started the practice of giving forward guidance on monetary policy.", "Because of its potential impact, we pay much more attention to the language and nuancing of the \"forward guidance\" paragraphs than other parts of the statement.", "Our experience in this regard has been quite positive.", "Nevertheless, we face some challenges.", "Let me give you a flavor of that.", "Forward guidance is always conditional.", "The dilemma then is how precisely the conditionality is to be communicated, and how to ensure that the market does not ignore the conditionality and interpret the guidance as an irrevocable commitment.", "Conversely, how does the central bank ensure that it does not become hostage to its guidance?", "Also, the more uncertain the situation, the greater the need for guidance.", "But also, the more uncertain the situation, the more difficult it is to give definitive guidance.", "For example, when the forward outlook is uncertain, we are not able to precisely define the conditions under which the guidance holds and the conditions under which we may have to deviate from it.", "When we are not forthcoming on specifying the conditions, the market starts speculating on them, thereby raising the \"noise\" to message ratio.", "Despite these challenges, in the Reserve Bank, our experience with greater openness has been quite positive.", "We found that effective communication can be a powerful tool provided the central bank has credibility.", "As their financial sectors get deeper and more sophisticated, EME central banks can usefully leverage on communication to enhance their policy effectiveness.", "To do so however, they have to improve their policy credibility as well as capacity levels.", "Central banks and central bankers have been at the heart of the global financial crisis.", "They have been blamed for policies and actions that got the world into the crisis; they have also been praised for leading from the front in getting the world out of the crisis.", "I believe this is fair critique - central banks have been a part of the problem and a part of the solution.", "As we emerge out of the crisis, central banks have their task cut out for them: to distil the lessons of the crisis, translate them into concrete reform measures and get cracking on implementing them.", "I believe this involves central banks changing in important ways both in terms of what they do and how they do it.", "The challenge of post-crisis transformation is not only different but also sharper for EME central banks because of their different macroeconomic and institutional contexts.", "EME central banks need also to learn to manage policy making in a globalizing environment.", "They need to learn from the best in the world, but adapt that learning to the demands and context of their economies.", "They need to be constantly pushing the envelope, be at the frontiers of domain knowledge, oftentimes reinvent it, but all the time remain sensitive to their core concerns."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary
