decade.", "The latter is potentially the result of the low levels of official interest rates, constraining the ability of banks to lower their deposit rates in order to protect margins (for example, Claessens, Coleman and Donnelly (2017)).", "Another way of slicing the data is to ask how much of the rise in mark-ups is due to a compositional shift over time towards sectors whose mark-ups are already high and how much reflects a generalised rise in mark-ups within each sector.", "Chart 7 shows this decomposition for UK-listed firms.", "Compositional effects do not explain any of the rise in mark-ups in the UK; and even if we do the same exercise at the firm level, compositional shifts towards firms with high mark-ups cannot explain the rise.", "Rather, the rise in mark-ups appears to be reasonably generalised across sectors.", "Although relatively broadly-based across sectors, the rise in mark-ups need not necessarily be broadly based within sectors.", "One way of showing that is by looking at the evolution of the distribution of mark-ups over time (Chart 8).", "This suggests the increase in mark-ups is heavily concentrated in the upper tail of the distribution companies whose mark-ups are in, say, the top quartile.", "Mark-ups among firms in this upper quartile of the distribution have, on average, increased by a remarkable 50 percentage points since 1987.", "By contrast, mark-ups among firms in the bottom three quartiles of the mark-up distribution have scarcely risen over the period.", "This distributional effect can also be seen from the large and widening gap between mean and median mark-ups (Chart 9).", "In 1987, this gap was 7 percentage points.", "By 2016, it had reached 44 percentage points.", "This strongly suggests that the rise in aggregate mark-ups over the past 30 years can largely be accounted for by a subset of high mark-up firms raising their mark-ups and/or market share.", "While the positive unconditional correlation between average firm-level mark-ups and concentration at the sector level shown in Chart 4 is not statistically significant, a regression of individual firm-level mark-ups on market concentration in their sector (at the two-digit SIC level) shows a statistically significant positive relationship when we include firm and time fixed effects.", "For example, Di\u0301ez et al (2018) find that the majority of industries in the US have seen mark-ups rise since 1980.", "Di\u0301ez et al (2018) find that the increase in US mark-ups since 1980 is also relatively broad-based across sectors.", "This fattening of

the upper tail of the distribution is most pronounced in the ICT, transport and storage and manufacturing sectors, each of which is associated with higher average levels of mark-up.", "In understanding the characteristics of these firms, one revealing cut comes from taking into the account the extent to which UK-based firms' sales are domestic or foreign-focussed (Chart 11).", "While both categories have seen their mark-ups rise somewhat, this has been far larger among firms selling predominantly into foreign markets (almost 60 percentage points) than domestic markets (around 15 percentage points).", "Within that, this rise in mark-ups among foreign relative to domestic sales-focussed firms is largest in the manufacturing and ICT sectors.", "Taken together, this evidence is

mutually exclusive.", "For example, Aghion et al (2005) develop a model which generates a concave relationship between competition and investment.", "Within some range, increased market power raises rents and acts as a spur to investment, innovation and productivity.", "But beyond a point, those forces go into reverse.", "Market power is associated with a fall in innovation and investment incentives, with knock-on negative effects for productivity.", "There is some empirical support for such a relationship.", "Jones and Philippon (2016) and Gutie\u0301rrez and Philippon (2017) suggest

the estimated investment curve.", "It suggests that firms with mark-ups above around two tend to be associated with lower investment rates, in line with Di\u0301ez et al.", "With estimated firm-level mark-ups having risen secularly in a number of countries, this is potentially a cause for concern.", "It is important, however, not to overstate the likely impact of this rise in mark-ups on aggregate investment, innovation and productivity.", "The rise in mean mark-ups in the UK over the past 30 years would still leave them below the levels at which investment rates start falling.", "The same is true among global firms.", "Indeed, among our panel of UK-listed companies, the shift in average UK mark-ups since the late-1980s would, using the estimated investment equation, be expected to have raised average investment rates by around 1 percentage point.", "Finally, there is the question of whether any potential negative effects of increased market power on investment and R&D translate into a negative effect on productivity.", "Evidence suggests there could be an effect.", "De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) argue that, once account is taken of the rise in mark-ups, it is possible to account for the slowdown in US productivity growth after 1980.", "And Di\u0301ez et al (2018) find that a firm's - \"reverse the greater the distance to the technological frontier, the lower investment a catch-up\" effect.", "If we look at the relationship between productivity and mark-ups across UK-listed firms, there is evidence of a positive relationship with TFP but no significant relationship with labour productivity (Table 2, columns 3 and 4).", "If anything the relationship with TFP may be convex, with higher mark-up firms being associated with productivity.", "There is some evidence of \"reverse proportionately higher levels of total factor catch-up\" effects, but only at high levels of mark-ups.", "Overall, then, while the theoretical and empirical evidence suggests it is possible higher market power and mark-ups may have come at some cost in lower investment and innovation, the evidence is not overwhelming and certainly would not imply that the aggregate effect is large.", "A

(path and variability) of interest rates less affected than inflation.", "Clearly, this simulation places an upper bound on this shift as it effectively removes shocks to mark-ups.", "In practice, the evidence on how the variability of mark-ups may have evolved is mixed.", "On the one hand, macro evidence suggests a fall in the variability of both output and inflation in many countries recently, a finding that has been attributed by some to a incidence of mark-up shocks (for example, Smets and Wouters (2007) and Kapetanios et al (2017)).", "On the other, direct micro-level evidence on mark-up behaviour over recent years suggests a potential pick-up in their trend and variability.", "To the extent that the historical evidence is consistent with a sequence of larger mark-up shocks, it would be expected to have made the task of monetary policymakers somewhat harder.", "Both output and inflation will have deviated more significantly and persistently from their long-run values.", "And although interest rates will have been adjusted somewhat more often in response, the trade-off inducing nature of these shocks places constraints on the degree of stabilisation monetary policy can achieve.", "The larger proportionate reduction in inflation than in output gap variability arises because mark-up shocks account for a larger proportion of the historical variance of inflation than output.", "The interest rate smoothing term in the COMPASS Taylor rule will also have a role to play here in limiting the extent of the policy response to the mark-up shock.", "The limitations of this

large.", "The slope of the Phillips-curve, \u03ba, is a composite of deep structural parameters in the model.", "In the baseline specification in Gali\u0301 (2008), the slope is: (1 - \u03b8)(1 - \u03b1\u03b8) 1 - \u03b1 \u03c6 + \u03b1 \u03b8 1 - \u03b1 + \u03b1\u03c9 1 - \u03b1) is the degree of price stickiness, is the discount factor in household preferences, is the degree of decreasing returns to labour in production, is the inverse of the elasticity of labour supply with respect to real wages (holding marginal utility of consumption constant), and is the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption.", "Significantly, the elasticity of demand, \u03c9, and hence the mark-up, \u03ba, affect the slope of the Phillips curve.", "The higher the degree of market power and higher the mark-ups firms charge, the steeper the slope of the Phillips curve (or, equivalently, the smaller the sacrifice ratio).", "We can roughly gauge the scale of this effect by calibrating the model.", "Chart 16 looks at the relationship between the slope of the Phillips curve, and mark-ups, \u03ba, for a given parameterisation of the model.", "The relationship is, as we expect, a positive one.", "As a thought experiment, consider the scale of increase in mark-ups seen by the average firm globally since 1980, from around 1.1 to around 1.6.23 Other things equal, this would be expected on this calibration to have steepened the slope of the Phillips curve from just under 0.1 to around 0.2.", "This is a significant change in the parameterisation of a key macro-economic relationship for the setting of monetary policy.", "One way of explaining the intuition behind this steepening of the Phillips Curve is that market power reduces the degree of strategic complementarity in price-setting.", "In a product market closer to perfect competition, firms will be reluctant to raise prices fearful that, with other prices in the economy sticky, demand would fall- away sharply.", "By reducing the elasticity of demand, market power reduces this risk and thus gives rise to greater flexibility in prices and hence a lower sacrifice ratio (for example, Ball and Romer (1990)).", "Let us now put this model into a stochastic setting, by assuming desired mark-ups fluctuate around a trend level according to some stationary stochastic process, \u03bat.", "These would now appear as cost-push disturbances in the Phillips curve: (1 - \u03b8)(1 - \u03b1\u03b8) 1 - \u03b1 \u03b8 1 - \u03b1 + \u03b1\u03c9 This tells us that, when mark-up shocks strike, a greater degree of market power will mean that a larger fraction of the shock will fall on prices than activity.", "A rise in market power, through its effect on the slope of the Phillips curve, will cause the Taylor output/inflation variability (policy possibility) frontier to rotate clockwise, with more of the burden following a shock felt by inflation than by output variability.", "(ii) Impact on IS curve The second way in which a shift in market power could potentially influence macro-economic outcomes is through the IS curve.", "One structural parameter in that relationship is r*, the neutral rate of interest.", "In the baseline model, the path of r* is determined by the path of shocks to households' marginal utility of consumption (x) and (a): = (1 - - (8) \u03c3 \u03c3-1(1 - \u03b1) + \u03c6 + \u03b1 In steady-state, the equilibrium real rate is determined by household discount rates (determining saving) and firms' trend productivity growth (determining investment).", "r\u2217 = - log \u03b1 + \u2206a (9) This suggests that, if there is any impact of market power and mark-ups on productivity, this could in turn have an impact on r*.", "Consistent with that, and taken at face value, there is a positive correlation between estimates of the US natural rate of interest and (the inverse) of global mark-ups since 1980 (Chart 17).", "But whether higher mark-ups might in practice have contributed significantly to the global slowdown in investment and productivity, and hence r*, is far from clear.", "The micro-economic evidence discussed earlier suggests these effects are difficult to detect and, to the extent they do exist, might be relatively modest in the contribution they have made to slowing aggregate investment and productivity growth.", "And if higher mark- ups have, in fact, been the counterpart to a rise of 'superstar' firms, benefiting from network economies, that would, in principle, raise productivity growth and r*.", "A second structural parameter in the IS curve is the interest elasticity of aggregate demand, \u03c3.", "In the simplest baseline model, this is determined by (the inverse of) the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.", "In more general settings, with credit constraints, it may depend additionally on the balance sheet characteristics either of borrowers or lenders or both (for example, Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993)).", "A rise in market power could, in principle at least, affect the balance sheets of borrowers and/or lenders in ways which could influence \u03c3.", "For borrowers, a rise in market power might raise equilibrium profit rates and market valuations.", "It may thus reduce companies' collateral constraints and their reliance on external sources of finance (for example, Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999)).", "For lenders, a rise in market concentration could in principle reduce the speed of pass-through of policy rates to retail deposit and lending rates (Gerali et al (2010)).", "Each of Equation (9) is specific to the Gali\u0301 model presented here, but equation (10) is a more general feature of macro-economic models, where r* is a function of the household discount rate and productivity growth.", "these would tend, therefore, to reduce the interest elasticity of investment demand, \u03c3.", "Whether these effects are significant at the macro-economic level is, however, far from clear.", "Market Power and Monetary Policy Taking this evidence together, we now summarise the various channels we have discussed through which monetary policy might prospectively be influenced by a rise in market power and mark-ups.", "First, if shocks mark-ups have increased over recent decades, this would tend to shift outwards both output and especially inflation variability.", "Because these shocks are trade-off inducing, monetary policy is constrained in its capacity to cushion them.", "In consequence, the path of interest rates (both its level and variability) is affected only modestly by a rise in the incidence of mark-up shocks.", "Second, a rise in market power also has the potential to alter the slope of the Phillips curve, as discussed above.", "This, too, may affect the setting of monetary policy.", "To see that, consider the period loss function for monetary policymakers in the textbook model.", "This can be derived from the utility function of the representative household (Gali\u0301 (2008)).", "It takes the form: Lt \u03c0t \u03baxt where the weight on the output gap is: Under optimal discretionary monetary policy, the policymaker minimises this loss function each period, subject to the Phillips curve, taking expectations as given.", "The optimal targeting rule for monetary policy is: \u03c0t xt This \"Golden Rule\" of monetary policy strategy simply states that the policymaker should let inflation absorb more of the adjustment, after a trade-off inducing shock, either when the relative weight on output in the loss function is high (\u03ba) or when the sacrifice ratio is low (\u03ba).", "If is set to its welfare-optimising level, this gives a refinement of the \"Golden Rule\": \u03c0t xt This tells us that, once the dust has settled, the degree of market power in steady state is all that matters for monetary policymakers in our simple framework when choosing the optimal trade-off between inflation and the output gap.", "Specifically, the greater this degree of market power, the steeper the slope of the optimal targeting rule: the policymaker should let inflation absorb more, and the output gap less, of a trade-off inducing shock.", "The intuition here is simply that market power increases the degree of price flexibility in the model and lowers the sacrifice ratio.", "This makes it optimal to do a greater amount of (now less costly) output-smoothing in the face of trade-off inducing shocks in the optimal policy rule.", "It is possible to calibrate this parameter in the optimal targeting rule.", "Chart 18 plots the relationship between it and mark-ups.", "The rise in average mark-ups globally since 1980 would, on this calibration, be expected to raise the trade-off parameter in the Golden Rule from around 0.1 to 0.4.", "This is a reasonably significant shift in the terms of trade between inflation and output variability.", "Chart 19 seeks to brings all of these points together graphically; it is an empirically-calibrated version of Figure 1.", "Point A is the starting equilibrium, before any rise in the (trend and variability) of mark-up shocks, with the policy possibility curve tangent to the loss function.", "A rise in the (trend and variability) of mark-ups then has three distinct effects.", "First, an increase in mark-up volatility causes an outward shift in the policy possibility frontier (A to B), calibrated here to be equivalent in scale to the outward shift from the counterfactual simulations.", "Second, there is the clockwise rotation of the Phillips curve, and hence in the policy possibility frontier (B to C), calibrated to be equivalent to the mark-up rise among firms globally since 1980.", "And third, there is the shift in the relative weight placed on output stabilisation by the policymaker, calibrated in line with the mark-up shift (C to D).", "The net effect of increased market power is a significant rise in inflation variability but relatively less change in output variability.", "Chart 20 uses the same calibration, but looks at the relationship between inflation and interest rate variability.", "Despite the significant shifts in macro-economic relationships and in policymakers' preferences arising from a rise in market power, the net effect on the (level and variability) of the optimal interest rate path is more modest.", "At root, that is because of the trade-off inducing nature of mark-up shocks.", "Third, the presence of market power and higher mark-ups also has implications for the level of output in the economy which could provide additional incentives to generate inflation.", "Monopolistic competition implies that output is inefficiently low relative to its (perfectly competitive) social optimum.", "For sufficiently small policymakers' loss function can be deviations from the steady state, the re-written to reflect that inefficiency: Lt \u03c0t \u03baxt \u0245xt 1 (1 - \u03b8)(1 - \u03b1\u03b8) 1 - \u03b1 \u03c92 \u03b8 1 - \u03b1 + (\u03c2 + \u03c6)\u03c9 The optimal targeting rule is also then altered to become: = (\u03c3-1 + - (16) \u03c92 1 - \u03b1) \u03c9 The additional constant term reflects the well-known inflationary bias under discretionary policy, first articulated by Barro and Gordon (1983).", "Output at a sub-optimally low level increases the incentives of a discretionary policymaker to run looser monetary policy to push output towards its social optimum, thereby generating an inflation bias.", "In steady-state, this inflation bias is: \u03ba2 + \u03ba(1 - \u03b1) This inflation bias is clearly bigger, the greater is the degree of market power.", "Chart 21 plots the relationship between mark-ups and the inflation bias implied by the model.", "Using our simple model, the rise in mark-ups by global firms since 1980 might have added as much as 20 percentage points to the inflation bias!", "This calibrated effect is implausibly large.", "Nonetheless, the qualitative point remains: a rise in market power may, by constraining demand, generate an added incentive to run loose monetary policy.", "That makes institutional arrangements which resist those temptations such as independent central banks charged with meeting an inflation target - more important than ever (Rogoff (1985), Svensson (1997)).", "Finally, while we find little evidence of mark-ups having a material effect on investment, market power also gives rise to at least the possibility of lower productivity growth, and hence, r*.", "There are a number of other structural forces currently lowering productivity growth (for example, Gordon (2012), Andrews et al (2016)).", "And there are a larger number still of structural factors bearing down on r* (for example, Monetary Policy Committee (2018)).", "To the extent market power is another, this increases the chances of those falls in productivity growth and r* proving long-lasting.", "The empirical link between market power and productivity is not, at present, well-defined.", "But the implications of a persistently lower r* for the setting of monetary policy are reasonably well understood.", "They include the fact that the probability of the zero lower bound constraint binding is likely to be materially higher than it has been historically.", "Recent simulation studies have suggested this probability may be as high as around one-third, if r* remains around current levels (for example, Kiley and Roberts (2017)).", "Implications for Future Research The link between the competitive structure of product markets, the macro-economy and the setting of monetary policy is a relatively under-researched area.", "This paper has only scratched the surface of this important topic.", "But trends in concentration and market power have clear potential to impact on the macro- economy and monetary policy, justifying ongoing research on the topic.", "To that end, we conclude with a few reflections on potentially fruitful future research avenues.", "First, the framework used here to understand the macro-economic implications of increased market power assumes a particular competitive structure monopolistic competition.", "This has limitations, assuming as it does that no one firm is sufficiently large to have a significant bearing on others' behaviour.", "In practice, strategic interactions between firms are likely to be important in many markets, especially network markets Kranton and D'Amours (for example, Bramoulle\u0301, (2014)), with potentially important implications for pricing and the Phillips curve.", "Second, the framework developed here also sidesteps questions about the competitive structure of the market for inputs, especially labour inputs.", "Dominant firms may exercise monopsonistic power over workers, in ways which have implications for profit and labour shares.", "Consistent with that, there is some empirical evidence linking market concentration to a lower labour share (Autor et al (2017)).", "How monopsony power influences wage growth and the slope of the Phillips curve are important areas to consider further.", "Third, there is further work to be done in understanding the balance sheets and decision incentives of so- called \"superstar\" firms.", "This includes their choice of debt versus equity, distributing versus reinvesting profits and intangible versus tangible sources of capital.", "These choices might imply quite different incentives and behaviours for example, about the level of investment and its interest elasticity.", "These are yet to be fully explored, at a micro and macro level.", "Fourth, the emergence of a set of firms with significant degrees of market power clearly raises big questions about the appropriate stance of competition policy (Gutie\u0301rrez and Philippon (2018)).", "These policy issues are clearly outside of the remit of central banks.", "Nonetheless, how these anti-trust issues are tackled could have implications for the structure and dynamics of the economy and hence for the setting of monetary policy.", "This, too, is an area ripe for further research.", "Finally, the apparent puzzle between the secular rise in mark-ups at the firm level on the one hand, and relatively low and stable aggregate inflation on the other hand, could usefully be reconciled.", "Current estimates of mark-ups using firm-level data may suffer from mismeasurement.", "Or other macro-economic factors may have more than offset their impact in order to keep inflation stable.", "How the evidence is reconciled could have important implications for inflation dynamics and the setting of monetary policy.", "'What Explains the Decline of the U.S. Labor Share of Income?", "An Abdih, Y and Danninger, S (2017), Analysis
