presentation, I will give a brief overview of the country's macroeconomic fundamentals going into the crisis, and move on to the policy actions pursued by the BSP, in support of the government's overall strategy, to mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 pandemic on the domestic economy.", "I will also provide you with the measures and reform initiatives that the BSP intends to pursue under

were adequately capitalized and the quality of their loans and assets were maintained.", "These provides sufficient cushions going into the crisis.", "These sound fundamentals have put the Philippines on a favorable footing relative to its peers.", "Earlier this month, the prestigious publication, The Economist surveyed 66 emerging economies and concluded that the Philippines is the 6th most robust country when the health crisis started, as characterized by ample level of foreign exchange reserves and relatively lower debt-to-GDP ratios.", "The health crisis has considerably altered our near-term growth narrative.", "In the first quarter of 2020, real GDP declined by 0.2 percent with full-year GDP projected to contract between 2.0 to 3.4 percent.", "Meanwhile, latest baseline

in global crude oil and non- oil prices and the impact of COVID-19 on global and domestic growth prospects.", "To mitigate the impact of the pandemic and ensure economic recovery post-COVID, the NG laid out its 4-pillar socioeconomic strategy.", "The BSP's contributions to the overall stabilization efforts fall under the third pillar.", "We expect that the economy will recover more strongly once fiscal and monetary stimulus gain traction and workers and firms resume operations.", "On the part of the BSP, our focus is ensuring that we pursue all necessary monetary actions under the third pillar to ensure that we are able to deliver on our mandate of promoting price and financial stability.", "Cognizant of this, we have been decidedly proactive in pursuing policy measures to support credit activity and domestic demand as well as ensure the continuous and smooth functioning of domestic financial markets by easing monetary policy settings and providing liquidity to the financial system as well as relaxing regulatory rules.", "Consistent with a manageable inflation outlook and well-anchored inflation expectations, the Monetary Board undertook an assertive policy response through a reduction in the overnight policy interest rate by a cumulative 125 basis points to cushion the country's growth momentum and uplift market confidence amid stronger headwinds.", "The BSP has likewise provided liquidity boost to the financial system by reducing the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), suspending the term deposit facility auctions for certain tenors, ensuring availability of the overnight lending facility (OLF) to counterparties to cover temporary day-to-day liquidity needs, and scaling down of RRP operations to help provide sufficient liquidity in the interbank loan and government securities markets.", "Meanwhile, global uncertainties owing to the COVID-19 outbreak heightened risk aversion in BSP supervised financial institutions (BSFIs).", "To encourage them to continue their intermediation activities, the Monetary Board approved the granting of temporary regulatory and rediscounting relief measures to these institutions.", "These measures include relaxation

to provide liquidity and ensure an efficient financial system.", "But we know that we are not far enough yet with this fight.", "The uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the pandemic remains quite high and even the long-term growth path may also change in the post-pandemic world.", "What else can the BSP do as the economy reopens?", "Since operational capacity remains constrained even under the general community quarantine phase, the liquidity support and regulatory relief measures will remain, subject to the general conditions of the economy and the financial sector.", "In calibrating future monetary policy stance, the BSP will continue to be guided by the inflation outlook over the policy horizon and the risks surrounding such outlook, as well as data on demand conditions.", "At the same time, when domestic developments warrant a scale-down of policy support as economic recovery gains traction, the BSP will ensure a smooth transition in winding down its time/state-bound measures.", "Exit strategy essentially entails reversion to policies that are consistent with long-run economic growth path.", "Nonetheless, we note that the winding down of support

long-run health of the banking system during and beyond the pandemic.", "Thus, we are gathering data on the actual impact of the pandemic on the banks and on their clients.", "Hence, we will review the use of regulatory buffers.", "The use of these buffers enables banks to absorb losses, expand lending operations and meet the liquidity needs of their clients, including MSMEs and people living in rural communities, without unduly impairing banks' long-term viability.", "Second, to complement our regulatory and supervisory initiatives to mitigate the adverse effect of the CoVid-19 pandemic, the

financial services than conduct face-to-face transactions.", "Hence, we need to adopt measures to quicken the use of digital platforms to deliver financial services.", "To expand the reach of digital transactions, we need to increase contactless payment facilities, such as PayMaya and GCash, which can be expanded to include wet markets, retail stores, and public utility vehicles (jeep, taxis,

continued flow of financial transactions during and post-crisis but will also enhance efficient distribution of financial assistance to beneficiaries aside from furthering the inclusion initiatives of the government.", "Lastly, physical distancing as the new norm, we expect that people would prefer to use electronic payment and financial services than conduct face-to- face transactions.", "Hence, we need to adopt measures to quicken the use of digital platforms to deliver financial services.", "To expand the reach of digital transactions, we need to increase contactless payment facilities, such as PayMaya and GCash, which can be used for transactions in wet markets, retail stores, and public utility vehicles (jeep, taxis, tricycle, bus).", "The adoption of the National QR code standard (\"QR Ph\") must be expedited to enable interoperable payments for person-to-person (P2P) and person-to- merchant (P2M) transactions.", "The scale of the recently launched EGov Pay Facility can be

technologies to support economic activities.", "Second, the immediate challenge is to provide tangible boost to the economy through the right combination of fiscal and monetary measures.", "Having already implemented a host of measures to build upon liquidity and keep companies afloat, the BSP's policy space remains sufficient.", "The BSP has yet to exhaust the conventional monetary instruments in its toolkit to support the economy, should conditions warrant.", "Third, the decision to unwind COVID-19 policy responses must be done in a gradual, prudent and informed manner.", "Complete risk assessment based on all available data must support the decision and timing of unwinding.", "Likewise, appropriate communication must accompany the decision to unwind.", "Finally, we will continue to

the impact of the pandemic on the economy.", "Thank you and good day."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
