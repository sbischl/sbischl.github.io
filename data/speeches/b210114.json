that the equilibrium interest rate is much lower than in the past; and that trend underlying inflation has moved somewhat below 2 percent.", "These developments reduce the amount we can cut interest rates to buffer the economy, weaken inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time if not addressed.", "In response, we have made changes to monetary policy that can be expected to support fuller and broader-based employment than in earlier recoveries, improving opportunities for workers who have faced structural challenges in the labor market.", "In other words, the new framework calls for policy to address employment when it falls short of its maximum level, whereas the previous framework called for policy to react when employment was judged to be too high as well as too low.", "The new monetary policy framework also eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate and instead defines the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal for which a wide range of indicators are relevant.", "Additional changes address the persistence of below-target inflation and the decline in the equilibrium interest rate.", "Research and experience indicate that persistent low equilibrium interest rates increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.", "As a result, actual inflation and inflation expectations will tend to be biased below the 2 percent target, further eroding policy space and exacerbating the effects of the lower bound, risking a downward spiral for actual and expected inflation.", "From the time of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective in January 2012 through the most recent data in November, monthly readings of 12-month personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation have averaged 1.4 percent and have been below 2 percent in 95 out of the 107 months.", "See Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C.

Stanford, Calif., December 1, To address the downward bias, the new framework adopts a flexible average inflation-targeting strategy (FAIT) that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.", "Under a FAIT strategy, appropriate monetary policy aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time to make up for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent.", "These changes could have a beneficial effect on the robustness of employment as well as the economy's potential growth rate.", "In current circumstances, where a strong labor market can be sustained without the emergence of high inflation, the conventional practice of reducing policy accommodation preemptively when unemployment nears its estimated longer-run normal rate is likely to lead to an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many workers.", "The gains in employment may have come sooner and been greater if the new monetary policy framework had been in place throughout the previous recovery.", "The new policy approach, by avoiding the need to tighten preemptively, could support labor market conditions that help to reduce persistent disparities.", "This could, in turn, boost activity and increase potential growth by drawing individuals from groups facing structural challenges into more productive employment.", "Research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.", "At the October 2019 Fed Listens event, Amanda Cage, who now heads the National Fund for Workforce Solutions,
