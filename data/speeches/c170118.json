management.", "Although by no means the sole culprit, the absence of a body with a remit and tools to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole was a major gap in the UK's policy framework.", "In a sense, prior to the global financial crisis, the macroeconomic loss function was incomplete.", "The principal remedy has been the establishment of the independent Financial Policy Committee (FPC) at the Bank, with a remit \"to protect and enhance the stability of the financial system of the United Kingdom.\"", "The Chancellor's remit to the FPC defines this as relating \"primarily to the identification of, monitoring of, and taking of action to remove or reduce systemic risks\", as long as its actions would be unlikely \"to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the UK economy in the medium or long term.", "\"29 To achieve these objectives, the FPC has a range of tools, including the countercyclical capital buffer banks are required to maintain, together with the ability to set limits on mortgage underwriting standards, such as maximum permissible debt-to-income or loan-to-value ratios.", "The FPC is the first line of defence against financial stability risks.", "But the remits recognise that possible \"in which attempts [by the MPC] to keep inflation at the inflation target could circumstances are exacerbate the development of imbalances that the FPC may judge to represent a potential risk to financial stability\".", "In such a case, the MPC \"may wish to allow inflation to deviate from the target temporarily, consistent with its need to have regard to the policy actions of the FPC.\"", "In the event of such a judgement by the FPC, the MPC will have to weigh the appropriate monetary policy response within the context of its inflation target and its secondary objective to support the Government's economic policy objective to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced growth.", "In effect, the MPC's loss function could be modified to include proximate indicators of financial stability (that are considered by the FPC): \u2261 - \u03c0\u2217)2 + - \u2217)2 +

FPC remit can be found here: result that inflation could deviate below target temporarily in order to achieve a more sustainable return to the target and more stable growth beyond the conventional policy horizon.", "The Current Trade-off How do these factors relate to the recent conduct of monetary policy?", "In May, the MPC said that the effects of a vote to leave the EU on inflation would depend on the balance of its effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate.", "Having observed the behaviour of the economy in the period since the crisis, the Committee was aware of the possibility that these effects could, in combination, mean a period of weaker growth but higher inflation and thus create a trade-off for monetary policy to balance.", "The Committee made its first full assessment of these effects in August.", "Over the three-year forecast period, uncertainty was expected to weigh on demand, investment spending by firms in particular, and a period of resource reallocation as the UK's trading relationships were re-configured was expected to weigh on supply.", "At the same time, the sharp fall in the sterling exchange rate following the vote to leave would imply higher imported inflation, meaning upward pressure on inflation.", "The MPC responded to this outlook by reducing Bank Rate by 25 basis points, announcing \u00a370 billion Chart 8: No stimulus

output and a total disregard for higher unemployment.", "Given our remit, that would have been undesirable.", "Moreover, because spare capacity would have persisted in such a scenario, this strategy would have been unlikely to generate a sustainable return of inflation to the target once the effects of higher import prices had become fully reflected in the price level.", "Chart 8 shows how, with the stimulus measures in place, the MPC balanced the trade-off we faced by placing some weight on output stabilisation consistent with the Committee's remit.", "Over the autumn, demand growth remained more resilient than had been expected, particularly consumer spending and to a lesser extent the housing market.", "That contrasted with the less sanguine assessment of financial markets as illustrated by the further, sharp decline in the sterling exchange rate over the autumn.", "Ultimately, the tension between consumer strength on the one hand and the more pessimistic expectations of markets on the other will be resolved.", "In the MPC's November projections, this resolution is expected to occur as imported inflation begins to weigh in coming months on people's real incomes, slowing consumption growth.", "This moderation in household spending reinforces the cumulative effects of a pick-up in uncertainty on investment.", "As a consequence, growth is expected to remain below past averages for the next few years.", "One corroborating indicator of this potential deceleration is that the UK expansion is increasingly consumption-led.", "Evidence from the past quarter century across a range of countries suggests episodes of consumption-led growth tends to be both slower and less durable.", "This is because consumption growth eventually outpaces earnings growth, increasing debt and making demand more sensitive to changes in employment and income.", "At present, households appear to be entirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties.", "The saving rate has fallen towards its pre-crisis lows, and consumer borrowing has accelerated notably.", "In the year to November, total household borrowing rose 4%, and consumer credit rose over 10%, the fastest rate since 2005.", "How household spending evolves, and the inter-temporal trade-off that households strike, will be important considerations over the next year.", "The MPC will continue to monitor these dynamics.", "In November, the MPC reiterated that we were choosing a period of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in exchange for a more modest increase in unemployment.", "But it also noted that there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.", "Those limits depend on the cause of the inflation overshoot, the extent of second-round effects on inflation expectations and domestic costs, the scale of the shortfall in economic activity below potential, and any risks around the development of imbalances that could threaten a sustainable return of inflation to the target.", "Recently, there have been signs of continued solid consumer momentum domestically and a stronger growth outlook globally.", "The MPC will monitor developments in the light of its inflation tolerance, and will explain its assessment and policy stance accordingly.", "It remains the case that the outlook for inflation will depend on the evolution of the prospects for demand, supply and the exchange rate.", "Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.", "Conclusion The people of the UK have chosen price stability as the primary objective for monetary policy, having reason to value inflation control.", "Their preferences have been encoded in the MPC's inflation remit.", "Although those preferences are set in a statute, there remains an element of discretion in how the MPC delivers its inflation objective.", "That is because the people of the UK also have reason to value stable growth, jobs and incomes.", "And in exceptional circumstances, trade-offs between real stability and inflation can arise that monetary policy is required to balance.", "This is now the case given the decision of the people of the United Kingdom to leave the EU.", "In the coming years, the UK will redefine its openness to the movement of goods, services, people and capital.", "The flexibility and dynamism of this economy will help it adjust as its relationship with the EU becomes clearer and new opportunities with the rest of the world open up.", "Over the next few years, the magnitude of the adjustment on the economy's supply potential, domestic demand, and the value of sterling will be somewhat uncertain; and this process will have a significant bearing on inflation.", "Whatever transpires, the MPC will manage monetary policy to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner consistent with the preferences and instructions of the people of the United Kingdom.", "Sen's capability approach emphasises \"capabilities of [people] to lead the kind of - and have reason to value\".", "As lives they value discussed in the text,

output\", if you like), is exogenous (e.g.", "In the simplest monetary models, is determined by TFP alone).", "An expression equivalent to the IS curve above can then be used to define the natural interest rate, \u2217, which is the interest rate that would prevail in the absence of any nominal xt Etxt+1 rt Using this, the IS curve can be re-written in output gap form, using the output gap definition and the definition of the natural interest rate to give: (2) xt Etxt+1 [(it Et\u03c0t+1) rt In other words, the simple model here abstracts from all channels of monetary transmission other
