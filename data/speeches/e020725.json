cent in October 2001 to 6,6 per cent over the same period.", "The acceleration in both these measures of inflation in the last few months, was a consequence of higher rates of increase in the prices

year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production price index slowed down from 10,0 per cent in December 2000 to 7,8 per cent in September 2001.", "It then accelerated sharply to 14,1 per cent
