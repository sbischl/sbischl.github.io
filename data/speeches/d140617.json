Conference.", "The National Microfinance Awards is a special event in the RBF calendar.", "This is when we get the opportunity to pay tribute to the key stakeholders and recognise the valuable contribution that microfinance makes to the national economy.", "More importantly it is about recognizing and supporting our budding micro-entrepreneurs.", "I am pleased to learn from last year's winners, that participating in the Awards has helped them raise their strategies, goals and ways to improve and achieve a better future.", "Furthermore it has inspired their respective communities, highlighting the hard work and discipline that is needed in keeping a small business running.", "At the Reserve Bank we are pleased to learn that as these micro-businesses have grown the business owners often involve their family members.", "This has provided valuable work experience, especially for their young ones.", "The extra income to the family translates into important advantages, including a chance for a better education.", "Micro-entrepreneurs not only create a path to economic self-reliance but they also bring positive social and economic benefits to their local communities

and medium enterprises or MSMEs in Fiji accounting for approximately 12 percent of our GDP or around $800 million.", "MSMEs, when given the right support, have the potential to lift the economy and can contribute strongly to employment, an issue which has been very much at the forefront of our development and growth objectives.", "I am pleased that the Reserve Bank of Fiji has been at the

the lender.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I want to affirm the important role that microfinance plays in creating opportunities for those who most need them, allowing our small entrepreneurs the ability to create a viable business.", "Successful microbusinesses provide jobs as well as valuable products and services to their communities.", "What is clear is that microfinance, and financial inclusion in general, has grown and adapted considerably during its short history in Fiji.", "In 2010 we set ourselves a target of reaching 150,000 unbanked Fijians by the end of this year and we celebrated achieving that target well ahead of schedule in March.", "I hope that our entrepreneurs and service providers will sustain their energetic spirit of innovation and experimentation as they strive to become more self-sufficient and adapt to our ever-changing economy.", "Concluding statements Ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult for one organisation to run these Microfinance Awards on its own.",
