monetary conditions for Switzerland in the event of sudden upward pressure on the Swiss franc.", "We stand ready to enforce the minimum exchange rate, if necessary, by buying foreign currency in unlimited quantities, and to take further measures, as required.", "The target range for the three-month Libor will be left unchanged at 0.0-0.25%.", "Since March, the SNB's conditional inflation forecast has remained almost unchanged, apart from inflation for the current year, which is slightly lower due to a reduction in the oil price.", "The forecast is again based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years.", "For 2013, we now anticipate slightly lower inflation of -0.3%.", "Consequently, inflation in Switzerland will remain very low in the foreseeable future.", "In the first quarter of 2013, the global economy was weaker than expected.", "The recession continued in the euro area.", "In the US, the recovery remained hesitant and in China, economic activity lost strength.", "In Switzerland, real GDP rose significantly in the first quarter.", "However, we expect a perceptible weakening in growth for the second quarter.", "The risks for the Swiss

neighbouring countries.", "The difference is primarily attributable to domestic demand.", "Once again, growth was mainly driven by private consumption and investment in residential construction.", "These demand components benefited from the relatively robust labour market, a continued strong inflow of immigrants and the favourable financing conditions.", "In particular, the supply of credit in Switzerland is currently having a much stronger effect on the real economy than in most European countries.", "In the case of exports, however, there are no indications of a lasting revival.", "Since the beginning of 2011, real exports have been moving sideways.", "They are being held back not only by the high value of the Swiss franc, but also by the subdued momentum in world trade.", "Moreover, investment by Swiss companies is hesitant.", "One reason for this is uncertainty about further developments in the global economy.", "However, further factors dampening investment activity are pressure on profit margins and the continued overcapacity in parts of the manufacturing industry.", "According to information derived from the quarterly survey carried out by SNB regional delegates, this cautious approach will persist in the near future.", "This means that domestic equipment investment in 2013 will probably stagnate.", "On the output side, too, developments were mixed in the first quarter.", "Construction, banking, insurance and health recorded clearly positive growth figures.", "In manufacturing, business activity merely stabilised.", "In this area, the situation in the

challenges.", "In particular, the threat that the Swiss franc could suddenly come under upward pressure again has not been averted.", "In the current low interest rate environment, therefore, the minimum exchange rate remains the focal instrument for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions.", "The financial crisis has shown that for balanced economic development more than just price stability is required; financial stability must also be guaranteed.", "In Switzerland, the fact that the SNB is required to contribute to ensuring financial stability was already laid down in the National Bank Act of 2004.", "Our annual Financial Stability Report is an important instrument in this respect.", "It draws attention to emerging imbalances and the existence of risks which, in our view, could jeopardise the stability of the banking industry as a whole in the medium term.", "In addition, last year a new instrument was created - the countercyclical capital buffer - based on the lessons drawn from the financial crisis.", "At the beginning of the year, the SNB proposed that this buffer be activated, and the Federal Council decided in favour of an activation in February.", "The countercyclical capital buffer will come into effect from the end of September 2013 and will strengthen the resilience of the banking industry.", "Moreover, it will help to counter a further build-up
