volumes of this \"crossing the threshold\" stage in the Hero's journey arch.", "In the real world, we acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose threats to economies and financial systems around the world, including the Philippines.", "The Philippine economy contracted by an average of 10.0 percent in the first three quarters of 2020, following 21 years of uninterrupted growth.", "However, said economic contraction was not reflective of the country's strong fundamentals or prospects moving forward.", "The BSP expects the recovery process to commence sooner as more industries re-open following the gradual easing of restrictions throughout the country combined with stimulus measures rolled out by the government.", "On growth, we expect real gross domestic product to swing from a range of negative 7.0 to negative 9.0 percent for the full-year 2020, to a range of positive 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year and an even faster growth in 2022.", "We anticipate interest

and within the 2.0 to 4.0 percent target range this year and in 2022.", "The strength of the Philippine Peso remains market-driven and supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals.", "The peso

low debt-to-GDP ratio, and a hefty gross international reserve.", "Overseas Filipino remittances are expected to rebound from a contraction of 1.0 percent in 2020 to a growth of 4.0 percent this

the pandemic is still unfolding, the good news is that the Philippine banking system is expected to withstand the impact of the pandemic.", "The financial system is in a strong position to both weather the significant economic effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and support the country's economic recovery.", "The domestic banking system is expected to remain relatively stable in the next two years.", "Majority of the Banking Sector Outlook Survey respondents projected that real gross domestic product growth will return to a range of less than 6.0 percent to 6.3 percent.", "Likewise, 69 percent of the respondent banks projected a stable Philippine banking system.", "Further, majority of the respondent banks projected growth between 10.0 percent and 15.0 percent in their loan

and several years of favorable banking conditions.", "Likewise, the result of our stress tests suggests that banks can continue to lend and prosper through a broad range of adverse scenarios.", "To assess the impact of the pandemic, the BSP rolled out a Comprehensive Baseline Survey in April 2020 and intensified our off-site surveillance of all our supervised financial institutions.", "The results of these proved useful inputs for our Supervision Departments.", "As the financial sector supervisor, the BSP needs to strike a balance between enabling banks to lend to the production sectors, including the micro, small, and medium enterprises sector, on one hand, and ensuring the promotion of safe and sound practices to contain the risk exposures of the industry on the other hand.", "This is the rationale for the time-bound nature of the prudential measures introduced by the BSP.", "This approach provides the BSP with the opportunity to assess whether the relief measures require further calibration, given the health of the banking industry.", "The BSP's relief measures are classified into five (5) main objectives: \u25cf Extension of Financial Relief to Borrowers.", "The BSP supervised financial institutions were given regulatory relief to enable them to grant equivalent financial relief to their borrowers, including micro, small, and medium enterprises, in the

extend cheaper financing to borrowers, including micro, small, and medium enterprises.", "Following these strong, time-bound, and timely measures, the crucial question pertains to how Philippine banks have been holding up through the pandemic.", "Based on our recent assessment, our key findings suggest that: a.", "Core funding remains relatively strong following COVID-19 outbreak; b.", "Bank lending slightly rises; c. Loan quality slightly weakens as borrowers experience cash flow interruptions and sustain losses due to the pandemic; We don't, however, see this trend extending in the long-run.", "d. Financial assets grow but a slower rate as banks opted to reduce Treasury activities to be e. Net income declines as additional provisioning rises.", "However, this is likely to be offset by lower operating expenses and deferment of capital expenditures and non-essential expenses; f. Liquidity and capital buffers remain intact.", "The banking system's credit growth continued amidst the pandemic.", "The banking system's gross total loan portfolio grew year-on-year by 1.2 percent to P10.6 trillion as of end-October From the funding side, the banking system's total deposits rose by 9.5 percent as of endOctober 2020 to reach P14.4 trillion.", "There has been a surge in the use of

Security System's Small Business Wage Subsidy (SBWS) Program.", "This shows that this facility is a viable and efficient means of distributing welfare benefits to indigent citizens.", "Likewise, since its launch in April 2018, InstaPay exponentially grew, registering over 1.5 million percent increase in volume and over 700 thousand percent in value as of November 2020, with the volume rising to 26.3 million from 1,740 transactions and the value growing to P144.4 billion from P19.1 billion.", "The performance of InstaPay for the pandemic year 2020 has also been impressive with a year-to-date growth rate of 446.0 percent in volume, from 4.8 million to 26.3 million transactions, and 325.0 percent in value, from P34.0 billion to P144.4 billion as of endNovember 2020.", "Based on the BSP Lending Rates Survey, quoted annualized bank lending rates of all the 46 universal and commercial banks have been generally declining particularly the lower limit.", "This, in turn, makes loans relative to nominal gross domestic product to rise by October 2020.", "Based on the Baseline Survey, the banking system may grow by 3.6 percent by end-December 2020.", "This expected growth, however, represents the top 20 banks across universal and commercial banks, thrift banks, and rural and cooperative banks.", "As the Philippine banking system continues to support our micro, small, and medium enterprises during these difficult times, we expect loans to this sector to rise further.", "In particular, the banking system's new micro, small, and medium enterprise loans used for compliance with the reserve requirements have averaged P143.8 billion as of the reserve week of 17 December 2020.", "Bank loan quality remained satisfactory amid continued loan growth.", "The non-performing loan ratio was manageable at 3.7 percent as of end-October 2020, although higher than the 2.2 percent ratio as of end-October 2019.", "Loan loss reserves have been generally increasing since the start of

to reassess the quality of their respective loan portfolios.", "The year-on-year growth of financial assets (aside from loans) moved from 15.2 percent in October 2019 to 9.4 percent in December 2019, and up again to 12.0 percent in October 2020 as banks pegged their Treasury activities on liquidity positions.", "Based on the survey, the BSP supervised financial institutions will maintain their strategy as the duration of their investments was reduced to maximize portfolio returns.", "The top universal and commercial banks did not introduce major changes in the composition of their portfolios as they assess liquidity risk.", "Exposures are mostly concentrated in highly-liquid and investment grade instruments.", "As a natural consequence, profitability slides.", "Banking operations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the (annualized) net profit of the banking system shrank by 15.8 percent year-on-year for the semester-ended September 2020.", "We however expect that other operating expenses will likely be reduced due to lower business volume and capital expenditures and non-essential expenses will be deferred.", "Based on the BSP supervised financial institutions' survey, the full year target for net interest income, other fees, operating expenses will drop while provisioning will increase.", "To mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on profitability, banks plan to impose cost-cutting measures (e.g.", "deferred capital spending and freeze hiring of non-critical positions), intensify loan collection activities, be stringent in loan monitoring, exercise prudence in loan releases, reduce cost of funds and boost marketing campaigns for new loans and deposits.", "The universal and commercial banks also intend to reduce their exposures to vulnerable sectors and to increase ancillary or fee-based business while thrift banks, and rural and cooperative banks want to fast track digitization initiatives to reduce operating expenses.", "Moving on, banks remain well-capitalized.", "The capital adequacy ratio of the universal and commercial bank industry hovers at 15-16%, well-above the minimum thresholds set by the BSP at 10.0 percent and the Bank for International Settlements at 8.0 percent.", "Meanwhile, the banking system maintained sufficient buffers to meet liquidity and funding requirements.", "Moving forward, the BSP will prioritize the following supervisory areas to ensure the soundness, stability, resilience and inclusivity of the banking system amid the ongoing health crisis.", "This slide shows the key supervisory areas that we are looking into - \u25cf Involvement of the Board and Management; \u25cf Asset quality; \u25cf Profitability; \u25cf Capital adequacy; and \u25cf Banking operations.", "We also fully support the two major legislations.", "\u25cf The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer (FIST) bill is expected to assist the financial system in performing its role of efficiently mobilizing savings and investments for the country's economic recovery by disposing bad loans.", "This bill has been approved by Congress and is now pending with the Office of the President.", "\u25cf The Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery (GUIDE) Bill aims to strengthen the capacity of government financial institutions - Philippine

important companies.", "We will also continue to push for three major reforms.", "First, pertains to Islamic banking.", "With the passage of Republic Act 11439, the BSP is clothed with clear authority to issue broader set of rules and regulations on Islamic banking.", "Second, the BSP is committed to promote sustainable growth by fostering environmentally responsible and sustainable policies and

systems, strategic objectives and operations.", "These are embedded in the recently-issued Sustainable Finance Framework.", "Several pockets of green initiatives have been launched prior to the

central banks and supervisors organized to enhance the role of the financial sector in managing climate and other environment-related risks and mobilize capital to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.", "This Network for Greening the Financial System membership will strengthen BSP's collaboration with counterpart regulators in building awareness and contributing to the effective management and mitigation of the impact of climate and other environment-related risks in the financial sector.", "Moreover, we have a lot to share with respect to the country's experience

becoming the norm, and more destructive ones may come in the future.", "We have to be critical of our actions and decisions today as they shape the future of this country.", "Finally, the Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap.", "You may have noticed the big shift towards the use of digital payments which started during the enhanced community quarantine and is expected to continue under the \"New Economy\" environment.", "The BSP has designed a three-year digital payments transformation roadmap with twin goals by 2023.", "The first goal is to drive the share of digital payments to at least 50.0 percent of total retail transactions by offering faster, more affordable, and secure payment options that provide greater convenience.", "The second goal is to expand financial inclusion to cover at least 70.0 percent of adult Filipinos by onboarding them to the formal financial system through the use of payment or transaction accounts.", "In closing, allow me to reiterate some key

monitoring of asset quality, declining profitability, liquidity and capital positions.", "\u25cf Financial sector reforms will be important in economic recovery such Islamic Banking, Sustainable
