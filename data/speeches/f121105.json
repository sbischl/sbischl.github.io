of the Celebrant, to ensuring that the country remains an indissoluble and indivisible entity through his committed, engaging and conciliatory leadership style which he bestowed on Nigeria during, unarguably, the most difficult and challenging times of her existence.", "The task \"To Keep Nigeria One\" and his vision of \"a united and prosperous Nigeria\" which he led during the trying period of the nation would have remained a mirage if not for the commitment and doggedness demonstrated by him and other compatriots living or dead.", "In the same vein, it can be said that the economic foundation of modern Nigeria began with his administration's pursuit of infrastructural expansion through the construction of numerous road networks, waterworks, airports, educational institutions, dams and power infrastructure, etc., across the length and breadth of the country.", "Others include the decimalization of the Nigerian currency, the establishment of the National Youth Service Corps Scheme and the judicious spending of the petro-naira, which providence bequeathed on the nation in the early/mid-1970s, to mention a few.", "It is against this background of his achievements in leadership and the current public perception of a disconnect by the leadership with the developmental quests of the country, that I have, with the liberty accorded me by the organizers, chosen

our thoughts on the need to accelerate the process of grooming and development of leadership across the various strata of our society.", "You will agree with me that it is appalling to observe that five decades after Nigeria's independence, our nation has remained beleaguered with the challenges of leadership, particularly, those imbued with selfless and unflinching desire to steer the course of our economic development and national unity.", "Nigerian economic development aspirations 4.", "As you will recall, in the quest to improve the material well-being and welfare of the citizens, various governments have over time embarked upon numerous developmental policies, plans, programmes and projects.", "Notable among these was the First National Development Plan (1962-1968), which was designed to put the economy on the path of accelerated growth by prioritizing agricultural and industrial development as well as training of high-level and intermediate manpower.", "The Second National Development Plan (1970-1974), through to the Third National Development Plan (1975-1980), were devoted primarily to reconstruct and rehabilitate infrastructure that were destroyed during the civil war

the economy and restoring economic growth.", "The National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) of 2004 was a home-grown poverty reduction, value-reorientation and socioeconomic development strategy for the country.", "Let me reiterate the fact that all plans, programmes and visions enumerated above, were to guarantee Nigeria's economic development by altering the model of economic structure of production and consumption pattern, reduce dependence on oil, diversify the economic base, generate employment, create a globally competitive and stable economy.", "Looking back, it is clear that the economy has not actually performed to its fullest potential, particularly in the face of its rising population.", "The Nigerian economy has grossly underperformed relative to her enormous resource endowment and the achievements of her peers/other developing nations with similar characteristics.", "This is, particularly so, because agriculture has remained largely peasant, while the high contributions of the tertiary sector to output suggest that the sector is not really servicing the Nigerian economy but, indeed, other economies.", "Little wonder then that the diversification index remains below 0.4 per cent over the years in spite of the numerous reforms that have been put in place.", "Comparison with countries with almost equal economic standing at Nigeria's 7.", "Nigeria's economic performance has been rather weak and does not reflect its level of resource endowments, especially when juxtaposed with the experiences of some emerging Asian

ladies and gentlemen, it is instructive to also note that the experience of Indonesia offers us a great deal of lessons due to the fact of being a plural society with over 200 languages and ethnic groups and a population of over 250 million.", "Indonesia with a per capita income of about $55 in 1965, has recorded a faster growth by year 2000 compared with other major emerging markets.", "This

of development.", "As a matter of fact, being the largest economy in South-east Asia, the government has introduced wide-ranging reforms.", "These included the pro-poor, pro-growth, pro-employment

of its development procured improved oil-palm and rubber seeds from Nigeria and became the world's largest palm-oil producer/exporter and a major exporter of rubber, with Nigeria having nothing to show for it, but instead has become a major importer of these commodities.", "Perhaps, at this point we must ask ourselves why these countries fared better than Nigeria.", "The obvious answer no doubt points to the leadership question.", "Today, these countries have been able to successfully surmount the economic quagmires that characterized their economies at the early stages of development having transited from poverty, corruption and political imbroglio into a more stable and prosperous nations.", "Therefore, the success stories of these East Asian countries attested to the truism that

frontiers as well as accelerating the pace of economic progress.", "We can, without any fear of contradiction assert that these leaders were nationalists, visionaries and uncompromising leaders in

considerable progress, the accomplishment is far below her realizable potentials given her abundant human and material resource endowment.", "The country is still grappling with numerous challenges, which has continued to militate against the achievement of economic transformation.", "First, from the standpoint of leadership, the country is seriously beset with numerous shortcomings in the leadership arena, be it in the spheres of politics, corporate or at the community level, etc.", "In fact, the case of Nigeria could be rightly classified as leadership decadence across all spectrum of human endeavour.", "The bane of leadership in our environment could conveniently be grouped into the following broad categories.", "Prevalence of executive/legislative/judicial lawlessness and corruption within the body polity as the personal interests of many leaders override collective goals.", "The frenzied quest for wealth over and above all other considerations has rendered leadership most ineffective.", "Abuse and manipulation of ethnic relationship by leaders in authority by way of nepotism, tribalism, favouritism and religious bigotry.", "Lack of leadership education and skills to discharge expected roles and perform leadership duties effectively.", "\u2022 Inadequate motivation of subordinates and followers leading to disconnect in leadership and followership relationship.", "Second, the economy is yet to achieve the necessary structural changes required to jump-start rapid and sustainable economic growth.", "The attitudinal and structural changes needed for economic transformation are still very much lacking.", "This is traceable to the manifestations of structural rigidities occasioned by the apparent weak linkages existing among the primary, secondary and the tertiary sectors of the economy.", "The huge foreign exchange inflows from oil have also not been effectively harnessed to ensure a comprehensive diversification of the economy.", "Third, the economy is faced with widespread dilapidated and dysfunctional economic and social infrastructure.", "This has hindered the growth of the economy, and was the result of decades of neglects, weak technological base and poor maintenance culture over the years.", "It is also a reflection of the low research and development efforts on the part of the government.", "Fourth, corruption has become endemic and has continued to ravage the entire strata of the society.", "In fact, corruption is a direct result of the weak leadership, poor value and reward system in the country.", "According to the Transparency International 2012, Nigeria's position in the Corruption Perception Index for 2011 was 143 out of a total of 183 countries with a score of 2.4/10, which clearly reveals Nigeria as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.", "Fifth, the menace of weak governance constitutes a serious challenge to the various efforts and reforms meant to achieve economic growth for sustainable development.", "Thus, the prevalence of weak institutions, poor governance as well as poor ethical standards in most public and private organizations, constrain the realization of economic policy objectives of the government.", "The effect of all these have permeated the country's regulation and law enforcement, rendering them ineffective.", "Sixth, is the environmental factor, particularly the weak investment climate, owing to the legal and institutional challenges as well as the spate of insecurity, which has continued to constrain massive flow of investment in the key potential wealth-creating and employment generating sectors of the economy.", "Finally, policy incoherence and inconsistencies and occasional policy somersault also pose a major constraint to economic development in Nigeria.", "Though, government policies, plans and initiatives tend to be laudable, they are most often discontinued with any change in regime.", "Thus, regime changes in the past had often truncated the implementation of good projects and programmes.", "Addressing the leadership challenges: what type is ideal for Nigeria?", "Given the various challenges confronting economic performance in the country, one pertinent question to ask is - How do we refocus our energies (political and corporate elites as well as the ordinary citizens) to attain the much desired economic progress and development?", "I am sure you all know the answer - Leadership rejuvenation at all strata of our society.", "This is because leadership is the hub upon which every other thing revolves.", "According to ATG Educational Series, leadership is the process or the ability to motivate others to unite and work towards achieving a common goal.", "From the standpoint of our current situation, Nigeria needs leadership at all the various levels of society to manage the wide spectrum of our socio-economic and political activities.", "As the leader of all leaders, the political leadership is very vital in achieving the total transformation of the economy as seen in the case of the East Asian Economies that were able to transform over a space of fifty years from minor to major players on the world economic stage.", "For Nigeria, it is essential for the political leaders to be visionary and transformational, to be able to see, project and assemble a vision of a desired future for the nation.", "In addition, they should be selfless, engaging and motivational as these are the fundamental prerequisite for mobilizing followership, particularly in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multicultural society like Nigeria.", "As a motivator, leadership vision must be clear, attractive and attainable.", "An engaging leadership would be able to build bridges across divides, and as such be able to foster necessary harmony for collective good.", "Leadership that would be effective in a setting like Nigeria must also be courageous to take radical and progressive decisions/actions.", "Finally, such leadership must be committed, determined and persistent to be able to realize a vision as well as attain the desired goals and objectives.", "As engraved on the plaque on the wall of Ray Kroc an American businessman who was behind the success of McDonald's Corporation: \"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.", "Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with great talents.", "Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.", "Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.", "Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent\".", "In the light of the foregoing quotation, Nigeria would require committed, determined, and persistent leaders in order to be able to realize the collective vision and to take our nation to the \"promised land\".", "Therefore, the attainment of the Vision 20:2020 to be among the top 20 largest economies in the world by 2020 is contingent upon our contributions as leaders in our various callings.", "Concluding remarks 29.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, I will like to close my discourse with a quote that would serve as watchwords in the discharge of our leadership duties and responsibilities.", "These words are golden and would assist us in re-evaluating our ways and actions as leaders.", "According to Phil Dourado, author, Speaker, Leadership Development, Speaker and Journalist, and Creator of the Leadership hub: \"People need to know who you are and what you stand for; before they agree to be led by you.", "Leadership is an agreement.", "If your self-story is not absolutely consistent and based on integrity - who you really are - people will see through it and not give you permission to lead them.", "Most often, they will hide their disagreement and your apparent leadership will be fake\".", "Given the inability of Nigeria to realize its development aspirations during the past 52 years of political independence, and the seemingly forlorn hope for realistic progress by many citizens, it is obvious that the country needs a new kind of leadership.", "Such leadership should be inspiringly creative and resolutely courageous.", "It is this kind of leadership that will be capable of taking the country into new frontiers of development, as has been demonstrated by the Asian countries that I had enumerated earlier.", "Leadership with a different kind of mind- leadership that sees beyond the obvious to spot the unusual solution if we are to realize the aspirations of the Vision 20:2020 document.", "Eminent Personalities, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is on this note that I implore all of us to imbibe the right attributes of leadership in our various endeavours so as to able to reposition our various organizations on a higher pedestal towards advancing the course of our national development and ultimately improve the welfare of our people.", "I thank you all for your
