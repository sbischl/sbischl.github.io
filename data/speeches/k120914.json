results were released in the first quarter of this year.", "A draft report entitled \"The Financial Competence of Low Income Households in Fiji\" was presented to the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce last month.", "I understand that an embargoed copy has been circulated and is now available to all the participants present here today.", "The Report makes interesting reading and I am sure that participants may have further questions.", "I am especially interested in the recommendations on critical issues that are pertinent to our financial system: such as lack of understanding among the low income households about financial products and services, particularly the cost of money; what are some of the innovative ways of disseminating financial literacy training and information; what kind of information do financial service providers need to design appropriate financial products; how can the private sector facilitate financial literacy training ; and, what are solutions that can
