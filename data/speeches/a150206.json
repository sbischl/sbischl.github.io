the Treaty does not allow us to take any decision which would entail funding a government through monetary policy.", "Are Greek banks in danger?", "What conditions do they need to meet in order to

the ECB failed to fulfil its mandate?", "It is true that there is a heightened risk of too prolonged a period of low inflation.", "We have deferred the point in time when we expect a return to inflation of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, which is our monetary policy objective.", "And precisely in order to fulfil our mandate, we took a number of important monetary policy

turning point and that outstanding credit should start to rise again.", "For its part, the most recent survey of banks conveyed more optimism as far as demand is concerned.", "There are also signs of an improvement in consumption as it benefits from conducive structural reforms.", "Another positive development is that we have witnessed a reduction in lending rates to small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been especially noticeable in the most fragile countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain) since September.", "Then there is the decline in the euro and the fact that the fiscal policies of the euro area are becoming more neutral overall.", "Lastly, the fall in the oil price and, of course, our monetary policy decisions themselves will contribute to this positive demand shock.", "All of this is helpful.", "So, it could be argued that there was no urgent need to launch this programme?", "On the contrary, it was imperative to act to prevent inflation

terms of the lending conditions offered, banks are now lagging slightly behind demand.", "There are those that claim our financial asset purchase programme will further reduce their margins, while
