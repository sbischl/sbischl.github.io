property in relation to other capital will generate considerably higher tax revenues, cf.", "When evaluating the tax system, an increase in property taxes will be matched by a reduction in the tax on labour and entrepreneurship.", "As shown in the menu of options in the chart, an increase in property taxes will provide a basis for reducing the tax on ordinary income.", "The cost in terms of reduced government revenues of lowering the rate by one percentage point is NOK 10 billion, while the costs of increasing the basic allowance by NOK 1000 is NOK 0.6 billion.", "The tax rate for ordinary incomes can for example be reduced from 28 to 26 per cent, combined with an increase of NOK 25 000 in the basic allowance.", "Another option would be to use the revenues to remove wealth tax

an investment project can only be calculated correctly when inflation is in line with expectations.", "Accounts tend to be misleading and equity prices uncertain if the purchasing power of money is not stable.", "The tax system, with its rates and thresholds in krone terms, impairs the distribution of resources to a greater extent when inflation is high and variable.", "The value of money and inflation have now been stable for almost 20 years.", "In earlier times, the value of money was more variable, and periods of high inflation tended to be followed by a fall in prices.", "The value of money fell sharply and permanently around the time of the two World Wars and earlier wars.", "In the 1970s and 1980s, the value of money also fell rapidly, but as a result of economic policy.", "The interest rate was kept at a low level and public spending was high in an attempt to achieve very low unemployment.", "Not only in Norway, but worldwide, there was a crisis in the monetary system in the 1970s.", "After the Second World War, the US dollar was pegged to gold while other countries held a fixed but adjustable exchange rate against the dollar.", "But inflation gradually became too high for the dollar to maintain its gold value and at the beginning of the 1970s the system unravelled.", "Inflation increased and was unstable in most western countries until well into the 1980s.", "For a 50 krone note in the 1970s, we could buy ten litres of milk and ten loaves of bread.", "The value of money fell sharply when inflation surged and later in the 1990s - after the period of inflation - we had to pay five 50 krone notes for the same goods.", "The metal standard and fixed exchange rate regime were not able to safeguard the value of money.", "This is why most countries have given the central bank and the interest rate the role of securing low and stable inflation.", "This ensures that money - which is so cheap to produce - retains its value.", "In order to avoid setting aside the objective of price stability, the central bank must be independent in interest rate setting as it may be tempting to seek new objectives and tasks when inflation has been anchored for a time.", "It would not be the first time that there would be excessive optimism with regard to managing the economy.", "In the early 1970s - after 20 years of solid growth - we believed the ghost of unemployment had definitively been laid to rest and new objectives were drawn up.", "We cannot - as in the 1970s - allow the interest rate to remain low over a long period of time in an attempt to achieve permanently higher output.", "This would lead to wide fluctuations and high inflation.", "Seldom are the considerations underlying interest rate setting pulling in such different directions as today.", "In many quarters, it is now argued that the interest rate should be raised rapidly to restrain house price inflation.", "This is understandable in the light of the severe effects that house price inflation and high debt have had on many countries.", "In other quarters, it is argued that the interest rate should be lowered to keep down the krone exchange rate.", "This also seems well founded in view of the substantial challenges facing Norwegian enterprises.", "However, we cannot raise the interest rate and lower it at the same time.", "The interest rate is set to secure low and stable inflation.", "With strong growth in spending on goods and services or with falling demand, the interest rate can at the same time stabilise developments in output and employment.", "In this case, there are no conflicting objectives.", "When inflation expectations are firmly anchored, we can give weight to the path for output and employment when we set the interest rate.", "In the assessment of the outlook for inflation and output, we also look at house prices, total credit and the krone exchange rate.", "In this respect, these variables are taken into account when we set the interest rate.", "Norges Bank only has one instrument, and the interest rate alone is too crude an instrument.", "Hence, financial regulation, the tax system and fiscal policy have to contribute more to promote other economic policy objectives.", "In the past year, very low key rates have been necessary to prevent inflation from falling too far.", "Over the past decade, inflation has remained at around 2 per cent, or close to, but somewhat below the target of 2.5 per cent.", "Division of roles in economic policy The division of roles in economic policy will now be put to the test: Monetary policy steers inflation in the medium and long term and can contribute to smoothing fluctuations in output and employment.", "The central government budget - growth in public expenditure - influences the krone and the size of the internationally exposed business sector in the medium term.", "This is important because the growth capacity of the economy - the fundament for learning, innovation and development - can be undermined if the portion of the business sector exposed to intense international competition is reduced.", "\u2022 Wage formation and economic structures and incentives lay the basis for the effective and efficient use of labour and other real economic resources, and for economic growth.", "With concurrently lower inflation and activity prospects, Keynesian demand management was an appropriate policy response to the crisis in autumn 2008.", "Norway has room for manoeuvre since there is confidence in state finances and inflation expectations are firmly anchored.", "We have been able to draw lessons from both positive and negative outcomes of such a policy in the 1970s and around 1990.", "There may be material here for a \"handbook\" of effective Keynesian use of instruments.", "First, when demand for goods and services and inflation prospects fall, the interest rate is lowered.", "At the same time, the automatic stabilisers in the budgets will work when tax revenues fall and benefit payments increase.", "When the fall in demand for goods and services is so steep that an interest rate close to zero is not sufficient, tax rates are reduced or government measures are applied.", "The measures should not influence long-term public sector priorities such as the size of the welfare state or the permanent tax level.", "When the economy turns, as it now has in Norway, the rule is that fiscal policy should be tightened fairly rapidly.", "This provides room for growth in the business sector.", "When public expenditure has been reduced, the key rate can then be increased to a normal level.", "According to the fiscal policy guidelines, petroleum revenues should be phased in gradually into the economy, approximately in pace with the expected real return on the Government Pension Fund Global, which is estimated at 4 per cent.", "In periods of high or rapidly rising unemployment, petroleum revenue spending can be increased, and inversely fiscal retrenchment is needed during periods of high economic activity and resource shortages.", "It now appears that capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy may return to a normal level in one and a half to two years - and with a somewhat lower unemployment rate than today.", "A different path can be met with an interest rate response.", "Our understanding of the fiscal rule is that the government budget for 2012 or at the latest for 2013 should be planned with a view to bringing down petroleum revenue spending to 4 per cent of the size of the wealth fund.", "This does not seem demanding compared with the situation in the years between 1994 and 1996.", "The tightening at that time started directly after the economy had turned and while unemployment was still high.", "Should policy now be tightened to the same extent that history in retrospect indicates was the case at that time, 4 per cent would be reached in the course of one year.", "It must, however, be added that in real time the tightening was not planned to be that strong.", "After the tax reform, government revenues from the corporate sector were higher than expected.", "But even measures on a par with those planned at that time would now rapidly bring down petroleum revenue spending.", "The rate of petroleum revenue spending - growth in public expenditure - is important for developments in competitiveness, which is also referred to as the real krone exchange rate, in the long term.", "But, in the short term the krone exchange rate can vary widely, and it depreciated in autumn 2008 because capital sought safe havens.", "This helped Norwegian manufacturing in the first phase of the downturn.", "Since then, the krone has appreciated considerably.", "In 2009 and 2010, government petroleum revenue spending shows a substantial increase and foreign investment via the wealth fund a decrease.", "This increases commercial demand for NOK, which directly contributes to an appreciation of the krone.", "More fundamentally, the krone is influenced by the difference in activity at home and abroad and how fast the interest rate has to be increased in Norway to keep inflation low and stable.", "The economic geography of Norway will change over the next 10-15 years.", "The domestic cost level and the real economy crisis abroad will bring pressure to bear on jobs and businesses in manufacturing communities.", "Job losses may have the most severe effects in areas where manufacturing has the highest concentration.", "In the ten most typical manufacturing municipalities Vestre Toten in Oppland, Lund in Rogaland, Fusa in Hordaland, A\u030ardal in Sogn and Fjordane, Ulstein, Hareid, Sykkylven, Stordal and Haram in M\u00f8re and Romsdal and Verran in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, local manufacturing accounts for more than a third of total employment.", "Times will become more demanding for the clusters of oil suppliers in S\u00f8rlandet, Nord-Jaeren, Haugalandet and Stord and for manufacturing in Kongsberg, Grenland, Helgeland, Salten and Ofoten.", "Fortunately, manufacturing districts have shown the ability to adapt.", "Research shows that the degree of geographical and occupational mobility is high for the Norwegian labour force.", "Few people remain permanently outside the labour force after a period of restructuring.", "But the communities are small and vulnerable and may disappear if the industry structure becomes too narrow.", "And as mentioned, the most important, perhaps the only, instrument available to the authorities in addressing this challenge is to restrain petroleum revenue spending in the Norwegian economy.", "The management of petroleum revenues It took a generation from the time the first oil field was discovered in the North Sea until the government began to set aside economic rent.", "The Government Petroleum Fund was established in 1990 and the first transfer to the wealth fund was made in 1996.", "Each year since that time, as a savings plan, the government has transferred a portion of current income from petroleum activities as deposits in the fund.", "Today, the value of the fund is around NOK 2.6 trillion, or slightly higher than annual GDP in Norway.", "There are prospects that new annual transfers to the fund will be made for perhaps a little longer than another decade.", "The fund will in that case continue to grow and may reach twice its current size.", "The actual building up of the fund may span a short generation.", "The fund will thereafter enter into a new phase.", "With lower revenues from oil and gas activities, the fund will no longer receive capital transfers from the government.", "When oil and gas revenues no longer provide the government with economic rent, only the annual real return on the fund can be used on a permanent basis.", "In the mid-1990s, oil prices were around USD 20 per barrel and income was set aside.", "This year the oil price must be over USD 50 to generate sufficient oil revenues to make transfers to the fund.", "We must be prepared for wide variations in oil prices, and the first year without transfers of oil revenues - but rather withdrawals - may be near.", "The government has stated that the annual return on the fund will be close to 4 per cent over time.", "Since its establishment, the average return has been 23\u20444 per cent.", "It is only one year ago that we witnessed the steepest fall in global capital markets in our time.", "By maintaining the fund's risk profile it is fairly probable that the average return will gradually approach 4 per cent again.", "The government can choose the composition, required rate of return and risk profile for its investments without taking into account the funding needs of Norwegian enterprises.", "Norwegian enterprises can choose their debt and equity capital structure independently of the government's financial investments.", "There is a capital market between the government as investor and corporate capital needs.", "The government's foreign savings plans do not therefore influence Norwegian companies' access to capital and required rate of return on their investments.", "The profitability of government investments is based on a discount rate of 4 per cent.", "This secures the same required rate of return as the government expects to achieve on its wealth fund investments over time.", "One question that nevertheless arises is whether there is a queue of sound and profitable projects that have to wait because of an excessively tight fiscal policy.", "It is difficult to find support for this.", "In the National Transport Plan for 2010-2019, which can perhaps be considered representative of government spending, spending on road investments is set at around NOK 140 billion.", "The profitability of about two-thirds of the investments has been evaluated.", "The calculations capture time saved and reduced costs related to accidents and the environment.", "Investment costs and future operating expenses are deducted.", "The projects show a total loss of NOK 20 billion.", "There seems to be few road projects that are economically profitable.", "A rare example is the Finnfast tunnel project that connects the mainland to the beautiful island group in Ryfylke.", "The Bj\u00f8rvika tunnel project is not profitable according to these criteria.", "Since the existing traffic interchange \"Bispelokket\" is so efficient, drivers will not save time when they take the tunnel between the east and west side of Oslo in the future.", "The economic return, as calculated here, cannot be the only criterion for selecting projects.", "The Bj\u00f8rvika tunnel will make Oslo a better city in which to live and work for one million people and create values that are not easy to quantify.", "The same also applies to other government investments that provide benefits and satisfaction beyond an easily measured rate of return.", "On the other hand, when the projects cannot be expected to increase the future revenue base in society, it is important the investments are financed within a long-term and sustainable framework or financed by user fees.", "Infrastructure or research reports for that matter can provide benefits and satisfaction over time, but they are not liquid and do not generate cash returns that can be use for spending.", "If the investments are made at the expense of the savings plan for the sovereign wealth fund, future generations will have to bear the cost.", "This is my twelfth address
