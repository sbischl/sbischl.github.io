has made significant progress since 2008 in actively reforming its financial sector.", "In late 2008, we embarked on a macro-economic reform program with the support of the IMF that provided the platform for fundamental changes in the country's economic and financial landscape of which the establishment of a modern payment system was seen to be a key component.", "Since then, a number of

the identification of possible target groups.", "The survey was the first of its kind to be conducted in the country and will be a crucial element in the drafting of a national strategy for financial education.", "Similarly, a survey was also completed last year under the SME Development project.", "The survey had as objective to provide disaggregated data about SMEs that will be used to review

Information System (CIS) to all lenders not regulated by the Central Bank, including government lending agencies or programs and commercial firms that engage in hire-purchase activities.", "In this regard work is being undertaken with the World Bank to enact a Credit Information System law which would broaden the scope of the CIS in Seychelles to include other entities and activities that are not regulated by the Central Bank.", "Furthermore, with the aim of modernising the national payment system, by broadening the scope of innovative payments schemes and reducing paper instruments as a

need for me to overemphasise that consumer education, consumer empowerment is fundamental across all levels.", "Financially literate and empowered consumers interact more effectively and assertively with financial services providers, ultimately leading to them attaining their financial objectives.", "Essentially, consumer empowerment is instrumental in supporting financial inclusion policies.", "Now, whilst it is important for consumers to assume the responsibility of acquiring the necessary financial knowledge and skills, it is important to reiterate that authorities and financial institutions should devote resources and work towards establishing mechanisms that support financial consumer empowerment.", "Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank AFI for organising such forums as they provide us, policy makers with the opportunities to exchange experiences on the different policy decisions taken in our own jurisdictions.", "Years ago, productivity was attributed
