Literacy Strategy which we are rolling out today on a national basis, and to the second edition of the Bank of Mauritius Thought Leadership Series.", "The theme for the round table discussion that will ensue is 'Financial Literacy in a Digital Era'.", "Our eminent panellists, who are also members of the Bank of Mauritius Advisory Committee, will be providing us with their unique insights on the importance of financial literacy, and how to best implement related strategies in Mauritius.", "I wish to announce that the Bank's Advisory Committee has two new members, namely Mr John Cusack who is an authority on combatting financial crime, and Mr Robert Ophe\u0300le, Chairperson of the Autorite\u0301 des Marche\u0301s Financiers of France and former Deputy Governor of the Banque de France.", "Given the importance of the subject matter, it could not have been more fitting to hold this event in the very year in which the Bank is turning 55.", "The unprecedented environment in which we continue to operate, and which is marked by the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, magnifies the pertinence of today's event.", "I would not do justice to the significance of the financial literacy strategy being launched today if I fail to highlight the dangers of financial illiteracy.", "Indeed, a lack of financial literacy inevitably results in implementation of poor financial decisions, thereby dragging down the quality of life of citizens, and severely impacting the very efficiency of our banking and financial systems.", "Ladies and gentlemen, We cannot speak about financial literacy without taking heed of how past events have played a major part in reshaping the global thinking on this front.", "The effects of the global financial crisis on markets are indeed still fresh

decisions on the subprime mortgages and synthetic instruments used for trading.", "The drive for higher returns, coupled with a lack of visibility on the risk side, prompted many people to invest in these securities.", "These events eventually highlighted the critical importance of financial literacy, prompting its inclusion as a matter of priority on the agenda of policy makers globally.", "In September 2009, at the G-20 Leaders' Summit in Pittsburgh, a pledge was made, I quote, \"to support the safe and sound spread of new modes of financial service delivery capable of reaching the

are often not only the result of financial recklessness, but also of bad planning, and lack of information.", "The implications of these shortcomings can easily spiral beyond control.", "Undeniably,

unfortunately fuel poor spending habits and ballooning debts.", "We are all aware that trust is the cornerstone for the effective functioning and stability of the financial system.", "As the system evolves and becomes more complex, access to financial services also becomes easier.", "What this implies is that there needs to be an appropriate level of financial education to enable customers to

from abuse and make them become judicious users of financial products and services.", "This is precisely the rationale behind the elaboration of our 2022 Financial Literacy Strategy, and the subsequent initiatives that will be rolled out.", "In devising its Financial Literacy Strategy, the Bank has endeavoured to create content that will meet the requirements of a wide target audience, encompassing our youth, active population and senior citizens.", "The strategy is intended for all consumers, and I am pleased to share that consultations have already started with our regulatees in Rodrigues for holding Train the Trainer sessions and financial literacy programmes for the benefit of our Rodriguan brothers and sisters.", "By the way our thoughts are with them in these dire times.", "The programme content focuses on providing consumers with information on banking products and services, their rights and obligations, as well as how they should protect themselves and their hardearned money.", "The strategy also brings to the fore the dynamic and technology-driven banking environment in which consumers of financial products are evolving.", "This being said, I would also like to make an appeal to providers of financial services.", "My call is that you should always act in a transparent manner with your customers by disclosing all important facts.", "Do not focus only on the business side and on the bottom line.", "More importantly, in your communication to customers, do not omit details which, though they may seem insignificant or superfluous, may have a huge impact on the obligations and rights of customers or clients.", "Otherwise, in the short run, the improvement of business may come at a hefty price, be it in terms of rising delinquencies, complaints, law suits or even reputational risks.", "As a central banker and regulator, I need not emphasise that short term gains are not worth a longterm pain.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a sobering reality that the COVID-19 pandemic has tragically claimed the lives of millions of people worldwide.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has not only led us all to rethink our existing practices, but to also factor in unexpected scenarios and reimagine opportunities.", "Whilst technological advances like mobile phones, internet banking and other digital technologies were already present in our daily lives, the pandemic has resulted in an acceleration in the pace of digitalisation of financial services.", "As I fathom the radical changes occurring around us, digitalisation is bound to amplify, both in terms of speed and the dimension of its impact, the transformation of the banking and financial landscape.", "While electronic channels are indeed convenient to the great majority of consumers, we should also be wary of the downside risks that they can bring.", "Threats of unscrupulous agents exploiting loopholes, mis-selling and other legal risks are just some of these.", "I am sure that you need no

not, on its own, a sufficient condition for diffusion among the population.", "Collaboration and support at all levels of the banking industry remain the prerequisites for an optimal implementation.",

international financial organisations and financial literacy promotion entities.", "The Bank is currently benefitting from the support of the Bank for International Settlements to craft a strategic
