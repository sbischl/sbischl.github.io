decade, greater focus has been accorded to domestic sources of growth.", "Increased emphasis has been accorded to promoting the role of consumption demand in the growth process.", "Traditionally, the countries in the region have high savings, relative to other regions.", "ASEAN's saving rate of 35% is nearly double that of NAFTA and one and a half times higher than the EU's.", "There, therefore, remains significant potential for high rates of consumption without resulting in risks to our system.", "The increased consumption demand has been a factor that has reinforced the trend toward greater intra-regional trade in Asia.", "There has also been a trend towards greater intra-Asian investment flows in the region.", "This includes increased reinvestment of the surplus funds back into the

and changes that may occur.", "Building tolerance levels involves enhancing our capacity, strength and resilience to cope with the changed environment.", "Precautionary measures can be taken to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities.", "Despite uncertainties and unstable conditions, initiatives can be taken to achieve sustainable performance.", "In the current environment, the pressure is for greater market orientation and liberalisation on the premise that competition would lead to pricing that would facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources.", "This, however, is not the only objective that is to be achieved.", "Consideration needs to be given to the objective of promoting growth, financial stability and social stability.", "Some of these objectives are conflicting and need to be carefully balanced, taking into account the trade offs.", "Increasing the tolerance level amidst a volatile environment The pursuit of efficiency and competition has to be balanced with the objective of attaining soundness and preserving stability.", "Given the unique characteristics and peculiarities of emerging economies, the transition to a more liberalised environment would demand appropriate sequencing of measures to be taken.", "Factors commonly ascribed as key in achieving and safeguarding financial stability include sound macro-economic management, effective regulatory and supervisory framework, greater transparency and disclosure of information, increased market discipline, dynamic accounting and auditing standards as well as the existence of strong corporate governance.", "For emerging economies, the requirements extend beyond these factors to include other areas, namely the development of the necessary financial infrastructure that supports a strong foundation that is able to provide depth and breadth to the financial system and economy as a whole.", "Of equal importance, is the need to develop alternative sources of funding, such as the equity and bond markets, not simply to ensure a more balanced allocation of financial and economic resources within an economy but more importantly to attain greater diversification within the financial system, hence ensuring the efficient distribution of risks within the system.", "In addition, the integrity and credibility of the payments system and effectiveness of regulation and supervision would require the support of a comprehensive set of legislations, one that would need to evolve in tandem with the developments that are taking place in the financial landscape.", "It is also recognised that good corporate governance reinforces sound regulation and supervision.", "It contributes towards maintaining market confidence, and strengthens transparency and accountability.", "For corporate governance to work, good corporate practices need to be instilled and embedded in all aspects of the operations and at all levels within the organisation.", "To succeed in the new environment, institutions will require qualified board members and management teams that exhibit a high degree of professionalism.", "In addition, transparency and disclosure is essential, particularly in a rapidly changing environment and greater attention is being accorded to make banking systems more transparent.", "While the comprehensive and timely availability of financial information will enhance market discipline in emerging market economies, the disclosure of information must be complemented with the ability of the market players to analyse, digest and appropriately interpret the information to achieve the desired results.", "Closely related to this is the need to strengthen the framework for consumer protection to provide an avenue for redress in cases where consumers are placed in a disadvantaged or unfair position resulting from financial transactions taken due to lack of transparency and understanding.", "The move towards the adoption of the supervised market approach requires continuous efforts to enhance product disclosures and to elevate the level of financial literacy of consumers.", "Dealing with consumer awareness and education require considerable time and commitment.", "While recognising the potential benefits of liberalisation to the domestic financial system, the need to ensure the proper sequencing, and to manage the liberalisation process must be accorded importance.", "Financial systems in emerging economies have and are expected to continue to play a significant role in the economy.", "As such, the process of international integration of the domestic financial system has to be paced with developments in the domestic system so as to ensure that the system is adequately prepared to cope with the challenges arising from the liberalisation process without destabilising effects on the domestic economy.", "The liberalisation process must be managed with respect to identifying the potential sources of risks to the system.", "Experience has shown that the timing for opening up of the financial system will need to be sequenced and guided by the objectives to develop a more diversified economy where the respective sub-sectors and segments of society have access to adequate financial services; and to ensure the enhanced and meaningful contribution by domestic financial institutions to the economic growth and transformation process through capacity building.", "In achieving these objectives, a key trade off is between the need to enhance institutional capacity and the need to phase in competitive forces through the appropriate sequencing of market liberalisation.", "It is therefore, important that the liberalisation process is sequenced and managed effectively, according to the stages of development of the domestic financial system, the inherent risks and the strength of the social safety net as well as the tolerance level of the financial system.", "Successful implementation of this process, including evaluation of the trade-offs involved, will at the same time enable the emerging economies to achieve the overall national objectives.", "It must be emphasised that the tolerance level for the system as a whole will only be as strong as the strength of its components.", "Having robust financial institutions that are able to withstand any potential shocks and that have the agility and adaptability to embrace the future challenges are key to ensuring long-term sustainability and survival in the competitive future as well as the maintenance of financial stability.", "One of the most important aspects in enhancing the tolerance level involves building the capacity and institutional development.", "Wide-ranging strategies have included consolidation, reengineering of business processes and reassessment of business models to fit the new financial landscape.", "Leveraging on advancements in information and communication technology is important to improve business automation and efficiency levels.", "To achieve a higher level of operational efficiency, rationalisation of business networks and outsourcing are gaining greater significance.", "The journey is however never-ending, to adapt to the changing needs of

level of efficiency in doing business.", "The financial institution, as a service provider, relies heavily on human intellectual capital which contributes to the innovativeness and competitiveness of the institution.", "Thus, human capital has been constantly sharpened through continuous development programmes and challenged to maximise its full potential.", "Towards this end, Bank Negara Malaysia

adverse consequences faced by financial institutions during periods of uncertainty.", "Effective risk management systems facilitate the measurement and management of risk exposures, thus minimising potential future losses.", "In addition, robust internal controls which are designed to provide qualitative standards are also necessary to complement the quantitative analysis of risk and provide a check and balance in the overall risk management practices.", "The Malaysian experience Let me now take the opportunity to share with you Malaysia's experience in addressing some of these issues.", "The blue print for the development of the financial sector in Malaysia is outlined in Financial Sector Masterplan that was released about three years ago.", "The Masterplan is all about determining the future directions of the financial system and to define the financial structure that is most appropriate to our requirements as our economy moves to the next stage of development.", "It therefore provides the direction and common purpose for all the relevant parties in the financial sector, the industry, the market participants, the regulators, and the government.", "In emerging economies, the role of the government and the regulator is important in particular to prioritise policy goals, build the infrastructure, provide the legal and supervisory framework, and in addressing market failures.", "The key emphasis of the plan is to move toward a more diversified and balanced financial structure with a strengthened institutional framework, enhanced market infrastructure and practices, and an appropriate regulatory environment in line with the transformation that has taken place.", "The Asian crisis highlighted the vulnerability associated with fragmented financial systems and the risk of excessive reliance on the banking sector.", "Strategies therefore focused on introducing reform measures to strengthen the banking sector and develop and enhance alternative sources of financing.", "The objective is to develop an intermediation structure that will facilitate an economic transformation toward a more diversified economy, namely: Develop the domestic bond market; Develop venture capital industry to support new growth areas such as the ICT and bio-technology sectors; Enhance the framework for financing the small and medium-sized enterprises or SMEs; Develop micro finance services especially micro credit for micro enterprises; and Strengthen the development financial institutions to ensure more effective use of public sector resources in achieving socio-economic objectives and greater complementaries with the banking sector.", "Following the successful financial restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector, efforts have shifted to building the domestic financial infrastructure.", "The industry-wide consolidation exercise for the domestic banking institutions after the crisis saw the 71 banking institutions pre-crisis being consolidated into 10 domestic banking groups.", "The consolidation exercise was a major structural enhancement of the financial system.", "Banking institutions have now attained a minimum capital size

the bond market increased to 16% of the total private sector debt financing (as at end-June 2003) from 9.3% in 1996.", "Another development in our financial landscape is the growing significance of
