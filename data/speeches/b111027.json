compromise of quantifying fiscal soundness without interfering with the budgetary and fiscal policies of sovereign states.", "It aimed to maintain fiscal discipline within EMU.", "Member states adopting the euro had to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria, and the SGP should make sure that they continue to observe them.", "The compromise was also characterized by the strong belief that governments would be reactive to market discipline.", "However there was a lack of political will to commit to sustained stability-oriented fiscal policy.", "The weak commitment was evident when the Stability and Growth Pact was watered down under the pressure of France and Germany in 2003.", "Moreover, the rule book failed to consider the possibility of a financial crisis in the euro area

major weaknesses in the Maastricht Treaty: It was based on a flawed economic paradigm and it did not foresee geopolitical developments before and after the introduction of the single currency.",

pendulum strikes back.", "There is a clear risk that the well founded desire for improved regulation leads to a too tight corset that ultimately might strangulate market dynamics.", "It would be misleading to assume that partial market or regulatory failure in the past means that the government would always provide superior solutions by governments.", "Excessive faith in the state as well as a sprawling public sector lead in the long run into servitude, as argued by the Austrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek and proved by the communist movements of the previous century.", "Only in

public debt with some 119 percent of GDP is larger than that of the UK (80 percent of GDP), the Italian private sector has much stronger balance sheets than the UK private sector.", "This means that the Italian government has stronger private wealth for potential future taxation than the UK.", "Moreover, the consolidation plans of the Italian government are far more ambitious that the British ones.", "Some argue that growth prospects for the UK are more promising as its central bank could depreciate its own currency by a very lax monetary policy.", "By doing so, future growth and tax revenues would be boosted.", "The problem is, however, that the UK economy heavily relies on a huge non-exporting service sector (while in Italy manufacturing plays a bigger role), which does not profit from a weaker currency.", "Indeed, exports in the UK have failed to recover in spite of the great sterling depreciation.", "By contrast, since the end of 2007, the British GDP has contracted cumulatively by 3.4 per cent.", "Moreover, depreciation comes at huge costs: The weaker sterling has made the UK's people poorer in real terms through higher inflation.", "In 2007, the average UK citizen was 30 percent richer than the average Italian; now they are just 5 percent richer.", "Geopolitical changes The Maastricht Treaty was signed on 7 February 1992 by the members of the European

of the Berlin Wall and the communist bloc.", "Laggard countries while catching up in their productivities in traded goods' sectors tend to suffer from higher inflation rates because within the service sector productivity growth rates are restricted but wages still catch up (Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis)5.", "This, of course, poses a potential threat to a currency union with the aim of a stable price level.", "Second, an institutional problem is the indirect result of these developments.", "The intellectual architects of the euro area assumed the member states of the currency area were basically the same who constituted the European Union.", "Only one institution on the union level - the Commission - would then have been necessary to represent the EU and to be in charge of the currency area's rule book.", "Today, the EU comprises 27 countries, the euro area only 17.", "However, with the exception of the field of monetary policy the euro area still lacks a true institution on its own with competencies on the community level.", "A lot has been achieved - responses within the existing Treaty The sovereign debt crisis has revealed that the euro area suffered from serious weaknesses in the fields of financial, fiscal and economic governance on the preventive side and had lacked a crisis resolution mechanism.", "But the current crisis has also been recognized as an opportunity to repair the institutional shortcomings of the \"currency without a state\".", "Europe has always made its greatest steps forward in times of crisis mirroring the words of Jean Monnet:

level of debt and regain competiveness as soon as possible.", "In order to eliminate any doubts on the sufficient fire power of the EFSF, governments of the euro area Member States plan to provide appropriate leveraging of the fund.", "The EFSF will operationally be allowed to intervene in the primary and secondary markets as soon as possible to tackle fundamentally unfounded distortions in the sovereign bonds markets.", "These distortions hamper the smooth functioning of the single monetary policy stance.", "Within the given framework, the implementation gap must be closed to resolve the confidence crisis that the euro area currently faces.", "Most of the above mentioned proposals have been decided already.", "As soon as possible the new governance rules must be applied completely and rigorously.", "Moreover, as stated earlier, factor mobility in particular on labour markets is an important adjustment mechanism.", "Labour mobility within the euro area works rather smoothly at the lower and higher skill ends.", "But the high share of closed public service in Europe, nonportability of pension rights, rigid labour laws and cultural differences make labour mobility a slow

the Werner Plan, a single monetary policy needs support from sound public finances and closer economic policy coordination with an agreed framework for national budgetary policies.", "This could be realized by either be a European Commissioner with special authority or a finance minister (not necessarily with a huge budget), as it has been suggested by outgoing ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, or another, ideally independent body that makes sure that national policies do not generate negative spill over effects which jeopardize the currency union as a whole.", "But in any case, the institutional vacuum that currently exists must be filled.", "I am confident that Europe can also overcome these challenges.", "There can be no doubt, however, that current and future steps for
