including the ECB - use a wide range of models.", "But with such a variety of models, the problem of setting the appropriate monetary policy stance becomes a very difficult task.", "I think that Ben McCallum is perfectly right in that the preferred policy rule should be one that works 'reasonably well in a variety of plausible quantitative models'.", "By the way, this approach can also be applied to the discussion whether monetary policy decisions should be made by a committee or not:2 The variety of views on the functioning of the economy should be larger in a committee.", "If the committee members agree on a decision that is acceptable for all of the different prevailing assumptions of the transmission mechanism, this could prevent monetary policy decisions which are optimal only in one specific model, but lead to negative results if another mechanism prevails.", "In order to determine such a robust policy rule, we have to take two decisions: The first is on the set of models which should be taken into account.", "And the second is how to weigh the results these models present under the range of possible decision rules.", "There are no definite answers to both of these questions.", "As concerns the weighting problem, some argue that minimizing the maximum loss across models is appropriate.", "This would prevent extremely bad results.", "However, others argue that this method may give too much weight to implausible scenarios.", "They propose to weigh the different results of the models according to probabilities over which one has to decide in advance.", "The decision about which set of models to include in this decision process and which models to exclude also turns out to be highly important but difficult.", "The inclusion of an additional model, even if it has a low probability, may strongly influence the resulting decisions.", "Concerning the models to be regarded in the decision making process, I think that at least one from the New-Keynesian school, which currently is employed as a kind of \"work-horse\" in monetary economics, should be included.", "These models are designed to capture short-run fluctuations in output and inflation and consist of an IS curve which represents the economy \u0301s demand side and a (NewKeynesian) Phillips curve which represents aggregate supply.", "Depending on the exact model specification, money can play an explicit role in the determination of output and inflation.", "However, it usually plays only a passive role (if it plays a role at all): Money demand is determined by the other variables of the model but money has no effect on them.", "Given this more or less unimportant role for money in New-Keynesian models, some observers already see money leaving the stage of the academic discussion on monetary policy.", "However, I think that a few qualifications are essential.", "First of all, I would argue that there is an implicit key role for money in the basic New Keynesian Model.", "For instance, implementing a certain path of the short-term interest rate is only possible if the central bank can control the corresponding supply of base money.", "Second, taking New Keynesian Models with a minor role for money on board must not mean that we should leave aside other models with a key role for money.", "On the contrary: The well-established fact that there is a strong relationship between money and inflation at low frequencies urges us not to exclude information from money.", "By the way: Even the Bank of England - which since the switch to inflation targeting has been very critical with respect to the usefulness of monetary indicators - now confirms this strong money/inflation relationship.", "Models that capture this long-run relationship between monetary developments and inflation or that exploit the predictive power of monetary aggregates are -

with hindsight - must be judged as too expansionary.", "As a consequence, the late 1970s and the early 1980s have been characterized by high inflation rates in the USA.", "I believe that the Bundesbank managed to prevent this kind of problems.", "Our research has shown that the Bundesbank did not assign an important role to the level of the output gap which is especially prone to the real-time data problem.", "Instead, we focused on deviations of money growth from target, on deviations of the inflation rate from the price norm and on deviations of the growth rate of real output from the growth rate of potential output.", "This approach is much less subject to measurement errors than one that uses the level of the output gap.", "Based on our previous research on \"How the Bundesbank really conducted Monetary Policy\" we have set up a new project on \"Taylor Rules vs. Growth Rate Targeting\" by Christina Gerberding, Michael Scharnagl, Franz Seitz and Andreas Worms.", "This follow-up project intends to answer the question whether, and if so why, responding to the inflation gap, to the change in the output gap and to monetary developments instead of putting a strong weight on the level of the output gap can be welfare improving in the presence of data uncertainty.", "Our discussion paper \"Money Demand and Macroeconomic Uncertainty\" by Claus Greiber and Wolfgang Lemke which will be presented tomorrow provides another example of a measurement problem.", "This paper uses a variable labelled \"macroeconomic uncertainty\" to capture factors different from the traditional determinants of money demand.", "The authors try to filter out uncertainty from observable developments in financial markets and data on economic sentiment.", "This measure turns out to help establishing a long-run money demand relationship that is able to account for recent monetary developments in the euro area.", "At the same time the study can be put into the perspective of model uncertainty as it explores whether there (still) exists a stable link between money and prices in the form of a money demand function.", "It is therefore an example for the need to improve the models used for monetary policy analysis.", "Or to put it in a nutshell: Models that capture the long-run relationship between money and inflation are always central to central bankers.", "Concluding remarks To close my remarks, let me stress that I think that if there is anything we can be certain about, then it is the fact that uncertainty will remain a key characteristic of monetary policy making.", "It is therefore worth-while to intensify our research efforts on the role of uncertainty for monetary policy and to refine monetary policy analysis along these lines.", "This will eventually put us in a position to make better judgements concerning the state of the economy and give us a better under-standing of \"risks and side effects\" that accompany every monetary policy measure.", "I am certain that this workshop will help us to make some progress in this direction."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Monetary policy", "Model uncertainty", "Data uncertainty", "Money", "Inflation", "Central banks", "Economic models", "Output gap", "Measurement errors", "Monetary aggregates"]}
