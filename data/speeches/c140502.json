emerged in our latest audit, all of which have been communicated to the banks to address.", "The main issues include: \u2022 In some banks, communications with borrowers on proposed sustainable

as part of this review.", "We are communicating the specific issues and actions identified for each bank, including the actions arising in from our wider insights into the effectiveness of the
