aged population requires additional attention both from the society and from the Government.", "More funds need to be allocated for pension, health and other social benefits of the aged people, while declining savings of the aged population could pose a threat in meeting such additional expenditure.", "India is one of the highest savers among the emerging market economies.", "Financial savings however constituted only 47.5 per cent of total household savings in 2006-07.", "Preserving the value of savings Till as late as 10 years ago, we had a fairly long period high inflation and interest rates; many persons planned their savings for old age, assuming that these rates would continue for long.", "The drop in rates after 1998 led to decline in returns for the retired who were dependent on interest income.", "Employers providing defined benefit schemes found that the extent of unfunded portion of the liability was increasing.", "Not all persons realised that they needed to save at rates higher than the inflation rate; inflation could erode the value of their savings and that health care and typical old age expenses could eat into their capital.", "The Reserve Bank's goal of inflation of around 3 per cent in the medium term, as articulated in its monetary policy statements, is thus critical not only for maintaining self accelerating growth and greater integration with global economy, but also to ensure that the value of savings for the old age is preserved.", "The best that Reserve Bank can do for ensuring a sustainable pension system is to accord high priority to price stability, which is precisely what it is doing.", "Financial protection awareness and financial literacy Recent surveys such as those conduced by NCAER1 in conjunction with Max Life show that higher rate of household savings at macro level can be explained in terms of increasing concerns for social security, high cost of education, health and meeting other social commitments.", "Saving for old age is not found to be a dominant factor.", "At the same time an overwhelming 96 per cent of households feel that they cannot survive for more than one year on their current savings in case they lose their major source of household income; yet 54 per cent households feel that they are financially secure.", "Financially-at-risk urban Indians appear to be even more optimistic than their rural counterparts.", "This clearly indicates that Indians do not take a long-term view of their financial security.", "There is therefore, a pressing need for financial literacy for better understanding of financial risks.", "At the global level, Olivia Mitchell2, Wharton professor of insurance and risk management, and chaired professor at Singapore Management University is also of the same view: \"Global ageing makes for a much riskier world, inasmuch as people tend to retire too young, save and diversify too little, and outlive their assets.\"", "Her research shows that many workers are underestimating retirement challenges, including the risk of outliving their assets, the future cost of healthcare and the erosive power of inflation in retirement and she too, therefore, stresses the importance of financial literacy.", "Another compelling reason for financial literacy is the fact that most employers have moved or are moving away from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes, which require employees to be able to better estimate their old age needs and plan accordingly, starting sufficiently early.", "Such schemes also allow workers to take their savings with them when they change jobs.", "In this new environment, where individuals have greater responsibility for determining their own retirement income, factors such as general financial knowledge, an understanding of the retirement saving process become critical to achieving one's retirement objectives.", "A survey showed that only 18 per cent of the people surveyed answered correctly the question as to how much $200 would grow to, at the end of two years, at 10 per cent per annum interest!", "The importance of starting early is illustrated in a case where two persons of same age save Rs 5000 per month at 9 per cent per annum interest.", "One starts early at the age of 25 and the other at 35.", "At 60, the former has Rs 1.23 crore while the latter ends up with only Rs 53 lakh!", "Greater efforts by employers can assist workers in their retirement planning and enable them to achieve their retirement objectives.", "We, in the RBI, offer an excellent retirement planning program for employees; only, it is offered towards the end of one's career rather than an earlier period when time value of money makes all the difference.", "Financial literacy alone is not enough While focus on financial literacy could lead to informed and responsible consumers, it cannot by itself ensure consumer protection.", "There has to be \"responsible\" selling of products; especially to vulnerable sections of society including, among others, senior citizens and low income groups.", "In particular, banks selling insurance, capital market and pension products have to be sensitive to the fact that the essence of financial services is trust.", "A bank accepts deposits on trust and assures a return.", "A bank customer relationship is fiduciary and not based on transaction -it is a long standing relationship and there is every need for banks to act with responsibility.", "As a recent Penn study3 on financial literacy put it, \"Nothing is inherently wrong with consumers or the modern, complex, and ever-changing financial services marketplace, but the interaction between the two creates welfare-impairing outcomes.", "Potential general approaches to improve that interaction include enhancing the resources with which consumers approach the market, changing the financial decision environment, or bringing seller incentives in line with consumer incentives.\"", "Various approaches suggested include providing affordable expert advice, akin to pro bono legal services, having true transparency requiring simplified products where benefits and costs are clearly understood and rules of thumb can be applied, having retirement savings rules with default rules that place consumers into higher welfare enhancing rates of retirement savings; aligning incentives of sellers of consumer financial products to bring them into closer alignment with consumers' best interests.", "According to the study, regulatory interventions must navigate the heterogeneity of consumer knowledge, skills, and behavioral traits, taking care not hinder marketplace changes that would enhance consumer welfare.", "Financial inclusion and financial protection As you are aware RBI and the GOI have been pushing for greater financial inclusion.", "This implies, first of all, providing an accessible and safe place to the people at large for putting their savings which can be withdrawn in case of emergency.", "What RBI is trying, is to see that the un-banked population gets access to bank accounts.", "Such bank accounts are also critical to ensure a safe and reliable payments system for old age pensions.", "Pension payment for BPL families and unorganised sector targeted at nearly 300 million workers, can be paid through bank accounts thereby not only saving the cost of making the payments, but also minimising leakages and pre-empting payments in the names of persons who do not actually exist.", "Bio metric smart cards /mobile technology and use of business correspondents as agents by banks have made \"no frills\" banking accounts accessible to low income families.", "A very successful example of using such accounts for old age pension payments can be seen in the State of Andhra Pradesh, where a pilot carried out in the Warangal district is being upscaled to cover all districts.", "Building up savings in such accounts and provision of small overdrafts facilitates creation of track record and gives confidence to the saver that emergency needs will be met.", "RB now treats such overdrafts upto Rs.,000/- against no frills accounts and credit provided under GCC at rural and semi urban branches as priority sector under indirect credit to agriculture.", "Further, RBI has allowed banks to use exservicemen, retired bank and government employees to be business correspondents to provide doorstep banking to the customers in remote areas that are far from a bank branch.", "use of intermediaries and IT solutions have now made it possible to provide accessible banking facilities to the large parts of the population that were hitherto outside the access of formal banking.", "It is easy to see how critical this payments infrastructure will be for providing old age pensions, besides life, health, weather, asset and livestock insurance especially in rural areas - Insurance is very important as it reduces credit risk and allows greater flow of credit at lower cost.", "Thus there is a huge synergy between financial inclusion and financial protection for achieving a more inclusive financial system.", "Housing, health and life style As is found in surveys, savings in India is mainly for owning a house, meeting emergency needs, education of children and social events such as marriages.", "Compared to the earlier period of high interest rates, owning a house in India has became quite affordable with lower interest rates and tax breaks.", "As share of credit, it moved up to 12 per cent of NBC in March 2007.", "The average interest rate on housing loans has consistently declined from around 16 per cent in 1995-96 to around 8 per cent in 2004-05, though it hardened moderately thereafter (NHB, 2006).", "Reflecting these developments, housing stock in the country had also increased from 148 million units in 1991 to 187 million units in 2001 and is expected to further gone up to 218 million units in 2007 (NHB, 2006).", "While on the one hand, there is an improvement in longevity, on the other hand, cost of good health care facilities is spiralling and there is little social security.", "The availability of affordable health insurance services to senior citizens is limited.", "The Government, on December 6, 2006, launched an exclusive health insurance scheme, Varistha Mediclaim for Senior Citizens, offered by National Insurance Company.", "The Union Budget 2007-08 announced that the other three public sector insurance companies would also offer a similar product to senior citizens.", "There is, however, still a large gap between the supply of health insurance facilities available to older people and demand/requirement for the same.", "The IRDA constituted a committee in April 2007 to look into, among others, issues relating to health insurance schemes for senior citizens, streamlining procedures and suggest possible incentives to the senior citizens for adopting healthier lifestyles.", "The Committee made various recommendations including on proper product designing according to the needs of senior citizens and their capacity to pay, drafting of insurance policies in simple language, uniform definition of terminology and standard terms and conditions for the Industry, portability of covers, sharing of information etc.", "It also recommended that insurers should offer Personal Accident coverage as an optional rider

citizens Banks have been permitted to formulate, with the approval of their Boards, fixed deposit schemes specifically for resident Indian senior citizens offering higher and fixed rates of interest
