strengthening the revenue side of the actuarial imbalance by increasing the property incomes of the private sector pension regime through better management of the reserves (which is being implemented

economic turn-down.", "The low debt level would only bring temporary relief, but acts as an encouragement to delay action.", "The currently favourable situation of the pension regime seems to encourage complacency rather than to be seen as a window of opportunity to set aside large assets.", "This is unfortunate, because the corresponding property incomes would offset the rising costs of generous pension benefits, at least if pension assets were equal to about 150-200% of GDP.", "If the actuarial neutrality of pension promises, unsettled by longevity risk, cannot be mitigated by action on the asset side, like accumulating reserves and managing them more professionally or snow-balling influxes of young foreign workers to prevent rising contributions to threaten competitivity,

goods in order to stay attractive and to provide additional transportation and housing facilities.", "The scoreboard of benefits reform According to the EU Commission 70% of the pressure on public
