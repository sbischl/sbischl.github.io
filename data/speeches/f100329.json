in the early 1990s, this share stood at nearly 70 per cent, but by late 2008, it had fallen to less than 60 per cent (Graph 6).", "The second factor is an increase in the household saving rate; in the early 1990s, around 30 per cent of household income was saved, while today this share is close to 40 per cent.", "China - Household Income and Saving Disposable income Saving ratio Share of nominal GDP Share of disposable income 65 65 35 35 55 55 25 25 1993 1998 2003 2008 1998 2003 2008 Sources: CEIC; RBA In China, as in many parts of Asia, there is now a recognition that policies to promote consumption are likely to play a more important role than was previously the case.", "In the past, strong consumption growth was often seen as something that would follow strong exports, rather than be a driver of the economy itself.", "This view is gradually changing and this is leading to an increased focus on structural reforms to increase the share of national income going to the household sector and to reduce the household saving rate.", "While reforms in these areas can be difficult, they are important if Asia, as a whole, is to continue to grow strongly in the face of subdued demand for exports from the region.", "How things play out in each of these three areas - public-sector debt, capital flows and structural policies in Asia - will have a significant impact on the global environment in which the Australian economy finds itself over the year ahead.", "As the Reserve Bank has spelt out a number of times recently, our central scenario is a relatively positive one.", "The economies in Asia are expected to continue growing reasonably solidly, while the advanced economies are expected to have only a subdued recovery, weighed down by the need to consolidate balance sheets in both the household and public sectors.", "Around this central scenario there are, however, clearly risks, particularly associated with the three issues that I have just touched on.", "Given these risks, one question is how should policy be set?", "The Reserve Bank's general approach has been to proceed on the basis of the central scenario, but be prepared to respond if things turn out differently, as we did in late 2008 when the global outlook took a marked turn for the worse.", "The alternative of waiting to see how the myriad of risks evolves before adjusting policy runs the significant downside of moving too late, particularly given that the economy is starting this upswing with less spare capacity than in previous upswings.", "Fortunately, in Australia we have had the policy flexibility to respond to changing events as they have occurred and this has served us well.", "The Australian economy I would now like to turn more specifically to the Australian economy, where the run of data over the past few months has tended to be on the firm side.", "Employment growth has been robust, business and consumer confidence is above average, the housing market has been strong, and there are signs that the period of business deleveraging is coming to an end (Graph 7).", "Collectively, these outcomes provide us with some confidence that the economy is now in a reasonably solid upswing.", "Unemployment and Business Confidence Unemployment rate Business confidence* -15 -15 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 * Net balance;
