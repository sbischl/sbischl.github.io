percentage points.", "The Italian banking system is now in a position to compete in Europe.", "It is expanding its presence in Central and Eastern Europe.", "Italian banking groups are smaller than the major euro-area intermediaries; the indicators of operating profitability and efficiency are nonetheless better than the average for the banking systems of the area.", "The integration of the groups formed during the last ten years is at an advanced stage as regards corporate structure, operating procedures and information systems.", "Further combinations between large groups within the Italian banking system would entail serious problems in terms of the creation of dominant positions and a substantial reduction in competition in a number of regions and provinces.", "Account must

creditworthiness of customers, especially those of smaller size.", "A recent report prepared under the auspices of the G-10 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors shows that bank mergers and acquisitions mainly involve domestic intermediaries in all the leading economies.", "In Europe most of the few crossborder mergers that occurred were between intermediaries based in countries with institutional, cultural and linguistic affinities or involved a bank in financial distress.", "When intermediaries of different countries are combined, legal and institutional differences and cultural barriers may hamper the transfer of managerial skills from the acquiring bank to the bank acquired.", "In Italy the fruitfulness of collaboration with intermediaries of other countries is attested to by the extensive participation of foreign capital in the Italian banking system, by numerous cooperation agreements for the distribution of financial and credit products and by the significant role played by foreign intermediaries in wholesale banking.", "The Bank of Italy examines every proposal submitted to it for mergers or acquisitions of major equity interests to be carried out by Italian

Italian banks have provided financial support to firms, including large ones and some involved in extensive restructuring.", "They have directed very large volumes of credit to small and medium-sized

local economy.", "For Italian banks, reducing costs and improving internal organization remain key objectives.", "Product innovation and the reduction of unit costs must be to the benefit of firms and households.", "They must be turned into an improvement in the quality of the products supplied and be reflected in the prices of retail services, above all for payment services and asset management.", "In a period of low inflation it is only right for banks to limit the fees charged on retail services.", "Progress in this direction, correct and professional conduct strengthen the relationship of trust with customers and are conducive to the orderly growth of intermediation business.", "In collaboration with the Antitrust Authority, we have launched a fact-finding inquiry with the aim of ascertaining the existence, for some services, of strategies and costs that discourage customers from changing bank.", "Over the last ten years, the banking system has been marked by a process of consolidation and a progressive increase in the average size of individual intermediaries, whereas the industrial and service sectors have experienced further fragmentation, with inevitable adverse effects on the productivity and competitiveness of the whole economy.", "The number of large industrial groups, essential for the spread of new technologies, is limited.", "The system of industrial

sector is particularly low in Italy by comparison with the other advanced economies.", "The proportion of value added by high-technology sectors is very small.", "This affects Italian products' penetration of international markets.", "Italy's share of world exports of goods and services in volume terms was approximately 4.5 per cent in the mid-1990s; in 2004 it fell below 3 per cent.",

the euro area as a whole and in the area's two largest countries, Germany and France.", "In 2004 Italy's index of industrial production showed a slight tendency to decline.", "To a degree, the transfer of traditional production to countries with low labour costs and rapidly expanding demand is normal.", "In Italy the phenomenon has intensified since the mid-1990s; the number of workers employed in foreign companies invested in or controlled by Italian firms has reached one fifth of the total number employed in domestic industry.", "In recent years, the prevalent reason for investment abroad appears to have been to cut costs; direct investment aimed at increasing firms' presence in advanced markets has contracted sharply.", "The strategies that will enable the system to reap the maximum benefit from internationalization need to be identified; better knowledge and thorough analysis of the phenomenon are necessary.", "An economic policy that intends to revitalize Italian industry must necessarily come to grips with the problem of firm size, in part by encouraging mergers and acquisitions.", "There are difficulties, above all in connection with the ownership structure of Italian firms.", "The banking system, which possesses databases and extensive and detailed information on the structure and profitability of firms, can promote mergers and acquisitions, provide the financial assistance and services needed to make the productive system more solid.", "The Italian economy contains instances of excellence in innovative and creative ability, not just in the traditional branches of activity but also in high technology.", "These more dynamic units can act as poles of aggregation for less productive firms.", "It's a challenge in which we cannot fail, in

closing days of last year, as of yesterday the dollar had recouped 6 per cent against the euro.", "Although, as mentioned earlier, the level and structure of yields do not signal risks, a growing imbalance between the demand for and the supply of savings in the largest industrial economy looms over the global financial system.", "A current account deficit in 2004 of $600 billion, a little more than 1.5 per cent of world GDP at current exchange rates, was absorbed with a depreciation of the dollar but without serious strains in the markets, in a year in which the world economy grew by 8 per cent in nominal terms and the demand for financial assets expanded even faster.", "The quantity of dollars as defined by M2 increased by 38 per cent between 1999 and 2004; over the same period the

by 48 per cent over the same five years, and the volume of assets denominated in euros rose to 235 per cent of the area's GDP.", "In Japan, the money supply and securities grew by 35 per cent; their

of the United States for the current year is expected to be of the order of $700 billion.", "The ability of the international markets to finance large imbalances between saving and investment in the major industrial countries has increased markedly in the last few years.", "The world economy will continue to absorb dollar-denominated financial assets; excessive repercussions on exchange rates and yield spreads can be avoided if the expansion of the quantity of dollars is not substantially greater than that of the other main currencies.", "Important factors, in this context, will be the overall balance sheet position of the private and public sectors in the three monetary areas, the growth expectations for the US economy, and the willingness of global financial intermediaries to increase the share of their dollar holdings further, while reducing that of other currencies and their domestic currency.", "A large loss of value by the dollar would be harmful for the orderly functioning of the financial system and the world economy.", "The increase in official interest rates should help to sustain the external value of the dollar during The resolve of the US administration, which it recently reaffirmed, to reduce the budget deficit substantially is crucial.", "But in a long-term perspective, a more balanced relationship between the major currencies cannot come about without a return to faster growth in Europe and Japan.", "In Japan, according to the estimates of the central bank, the increase in GDP will be approximately 2 per cent this year.", "In the emerging areas the pace of growth is likely to slow somewhat but will nevertheless remain very rapid.", "According to the IMF, growth will diminish to 3.6 per cent in Latin America, 7.5 per cent in China and 5.5 per cent in the other emerging Asian economies; at world level, the expansion in GDP is forecast at 4.3 per cent.", "In the euro area, the cyclical indicators weakened during the autumn.", "In November manufacturing output registered its second consecutive decline, reflecting the contraction in activity in Germany and Italy and stagnation in France.", "Indicators of the climate of confidence have not yet signaled a clear reversal of trend in the expectations of households and firms in the main countries, except in Germany, where the last few months have seen an improvement.", "The

per cent.", "According to preliminary estimates, industrial production declined by 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, and appears to have contracted slightly again in January.", "During 2005 the expansion in output is expected to gain pace, as a consequence of an acceleration in exports and in the domestic components of demand.", "A policy aimed at raising the Italian economy's growth
