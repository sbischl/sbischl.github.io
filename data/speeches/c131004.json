for goods and services have grown.", "Countries are not just able to exploit their present comparative advantages but are also able to use technology and innovation to change their comparative

poor.", "Globalisation has also coincided with a marked increase in inequality in most major economies in the world.", "As capital has become more mobile, investors are able to achieve higher returns by investing in new frontier markets.", "On the other hand, the entry of a billion more workers into the global labour force has depressed wages for low-skilled workers.", "The combination of these

"While part of the reason for slow growth relates to the global economy, there are also South African-specific issues that inhibit our ability to grow faster and create jobs.", "Over the past year, the South African Reserve Bank has highlighted some of these issues, even though we ourselves do not have the policy instruments to deal with these issues directly.", "We remain of the view that

hydroelectric potential that can only be tapped in an economically viable manner if we have regional supply networks.", "While South Africa and several of its neighbours are water scarce and hence

beyond.", "It is also natural that, as countries develop, certain industries become less sustainable for higher cost producers.", "Given the different levels of development and per capita incomes in sub-Saharan Africa, a win-win solution could be to develop parts of the supply chain in neighbouring countries to take advantage of lower costs.", "The challenge with many of these ideas and options
