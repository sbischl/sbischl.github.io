end of February 2009, subsequently fell back to a level of 1,270 at the end of June 2009 as the foreign exchange supply and demand conjuncture improved because of the sustained current account

it was possible to take bold monetary and fiscal policy measures to deal with the crisis in contrast to the situation following the foreign currency crisis.", "Korean financial institutions and firms had put themselves on a sound financial footing following the 1997 meltdown.", "Similarly, labor market conditions, which lag economic activity, have improved greatly since the beginning of the

short-term money market has been hovering around zero.", "Major policy tasks Enhancing macro-prudential soundness Spurred on by the financial crisis, a lively debate has sprung up about whether central banks should play an active role not just in maintaining price stability but also financial stability.", "The rationale here is that because central banks maintain close linkages with financial market participants they are in a position to pick up on financial system problems at an early stage while in a financial crisis they carry out the role of lender of last resort.",

outflows do not give rise to a heightening of foreign exchange and financial market volatility.", "This June the Bank of Korea, the government and the financial supervisory authority jointly announced plans for easing the volatility of capital in- and outflows; and this step forms part of the drive to heighten macro-prudential soundness.", "Construction of a global financial safety net In order to avoid any repetition of the financial crisis, individual countries around the world will in future emphasize soundness in their operation of the macro economy and the financial system.", "Under the global economic system in which we live, there are inevitably limits to what any one single country can do and, in this respect, its efforts need to be underpinned by the construction of a global financial safety net.", "\uf0b7 Many countries including Korea maintained sound financial systems and built up their foreign exchange holdings as a buffer against external shock only to experience acute foreign exchange and financial market turmoil right after the financial crisis broke out.", "A global financial safety net can be built drawing on existing international resources including a bilateral dimension such as swap lines between central banks, a regional dimension as represented by the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation, and an international dimension in forms such as the IMF's Flexible Credit Lines. )", "The Bank of Korea sought to engineer foreign exchange and financial market stability by activating currency swap contracts with the US and Japan following the

do occur by supplementing the foreign exchange reserve holdings of individual countries.", "At the Washington meeting of prime ministers and central bank governors this April, Korea successfully put discussion of a global financial safety net on the formal agenda for the upcoming G20 summit in Seoul.", "Consolidating domestic demand In tandem with efforts to prevent further financial crises we should seek to cushion the shock of those that do occur.", "This requires consolidating domestic demand by strengthening platforms for the growth of SMEs, identifying and fostering industries with fresh growth momentum, and rightsizing household liabilities. )", "Strengthening SMEs growth platforms Job creation and an increase in household income can be brought about by fostering SMEs that have high employment generation effects.", "Government support for the fostering of SMEs should put emphasis on new startups that have high growth potential rather than on existing marginal or zombie firms.", "- In the course of tackling the global financial crisis, structural adjustment was delayed, so that the proportion of marginal SMEs whose interest servicing ratio is less than 100% stands at more than 30%. )", "Identifying and fostering industries with fresh growth momentum By fostering the next-generation growth momentum of NT, BT etc.", "from a medium and long-term perspective and heightening the competitiveness of service industries, employment can be improved both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "Such high value added industries are vital in order to solve the problem of youth unemployment, which exhibits a high \"reservation wage\".", "- Although there has been an overall improvement in the labor market in Korea, unemployment among young people stood at 8.3% this July, which was still above its pre-crisis level. )", "Rightsizing household debt As household liabilities have been increasing faster than household incomes, the rightsizing of household liabilities, bringing them into an appropriate relationship with income, should be encouraged to avoid the shrinking of households' consumption capacity.", "Care is necessary as household liabilities may increase excessively when interest rates are low.", "- In the advanced countries there has been considerable deleveraging by the household sector as the financial crisis runs its course, but in contrast in Korea the household debt to income ratio rose from 146% in 2007 to 153% at the end of 2009.", "Korea has won praise as the country that overcame the global financial crisis most successfully.", "GDP growth for this year as a whole will be somewhere very close to 6% and next year it is expected to continue at its potential level.", "This macro economic performance is considered to owe much to the great dynamism of Korean economic agents, both households and firms, together with the timely and appropriate response of the policy authorities.", "While the world economy is not considered to have fully overcome the crisis and there is always the likelihood of ups and downs occurring in economic activity in certain regions, there is judged to be only a slight possibility of a double-dip recession or recurrence of the crisis.", "In this situation the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy appropriately in keeping with our particular economic situation.", "At the same time it intends to seek the further strengthening of international policy cooperation such as the construction of a global financial safety net in order to bring about coexistence and prosperity while warding off renewed crises.", "As the chair country of the G20 meeting, now preparing for the Seoul summit in November this year, we intend to firmly anchor our vision of \"the Korean economy as a model for
