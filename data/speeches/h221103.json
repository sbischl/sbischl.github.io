result, the ECB has accelerated the adjustment of monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with its target.", "Across the last three Governing Council meetings, we have increased our interest rates by 200 basis points.", "This is the fastest rate hike in the ECB's history.", "Looking ahead, the medium-term inflation outlook presents clear upside risks in a general context of extraordinary uncertainty about the future evolution of the European economy.", "Today I will argue that, at present, the direction of monetary policy is clear.", "A further policy adjustment is warranted in order to keep inflation expectations anchored and stave off second-round effects.", "However, the calibration of our stance should not rely on a one-sided view of risks - especially as we continue normalising our monetary policy in a highly uncertain economic environment.", "And it should remain focused on medium-term inflationary developments.", "We need to bring inflation back to our 2% target as soon as possible, but not sooner.", "We might otherwise create unintended effects, achieving little reduction of inflation in the short term, but causing excessive

longer.", "It signals that the central bank will not tolerate a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, reducing the likelihood of such a de-anchoring occurring.", "And it guards against the risk that monetary policy could exacerbate inflationary pressures by stimulating demand.", "[ But while the direction of the adjustment is clear, its calibration is not and its end point depends on the evolving medium-term economic and inflation outlook.", "The neutral interest rate provides limited guidance here.", "It is an asymptotic concept that describes the point when interest rates are neither accommodative nor contractionary in a situation where growth is around potential, inflation is not far from target and no transitory shocks are disrupting the inflation path.", "But that is not the world in which we find ourselves.", "Moreover, the neutral rate is unobservable.", "As I have argued elsewhere,[ estimates of the neutral rate are imprecise and widely dispersed.", "They are subject to considerable uncertainty in a post-pandemic world that has undergone structural change.", "[ Today, I find it more helpful to discuss the target-consistent terminal rate.", "This is the level of the policy rate that - if reached at the end of a short normalisation phase and then held constant - stabilises inflation at target by the end of the policy-relevant horizon in the absence of new shocks.", "I prefer the concept of the target-consistent rate to that of the neutral rate because it emphasises that we can gear our policy to a clear state-contingent reference in order to bring inflation back to target within a clearly defined period.", "Eurosystem staff regularly calculate estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate, which are an input into the preparation of our monetary policy meetings.", "[ But let me stress that these estimates are conditional on the economic and inflation outlook.", "They need to be continually reassessed in the light of incoming

arises when above-target inflation de-anchors expectations, causing excessive wage and price-setting dynamics that eventually fuel further inflation increases (the second-round effects).", "At present, this risk is mostly driven by high energy prices and their pass-through to prices of other items.", "Annual energy inflation is running at around 42%.", "Energy has been the main contributor to headline inflation for the past 18 months (Chart 1).", "Higher energy input costs have contributed to extraordinarily high food inflation.", "They have been a key driver of goods and services

anchored speaks for targeting the upper part of the range of estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate.", "And this range would move higher if upside risks to medium-term inflation

focus on short-run inflationary developments, which cannot be controlled by monetary policy.", "The full impact of our measures will likely reach the economy when activity and inflation are already on a declining path.", "[ This implies that our tightening will need to end when inflation is still above our target.", "Second, we need to factor in global monetary policy spillovers when defining the domestic stance.", "With central banks across advanced economies adjusting their policies simultaneously (Chart 9), they could accentuate each other's policy impacts if they do not sufficiently factor

inflation having a large global component should mean that domestic monetary policy needs to be tightened more forcefully to compensate for this weakened grip on prices.", "But if central banks across advanced economies are simultaneously tightening monetary policy - as is the case today - the opposite is true.", "[ If central banks do not fully factor in the effects of other central banks' policies, the current phase of global adjustment may give way to a more severe slowdown than anticipated.", "In recent decades, episodes of highly synchronised global monetary policy tightening have

such as residential property markets[ - and some types of non-bank financial intermediaries[ ].", "These segments are vulnerable to adverse loops, with falling prices and rising rates feeding into higher debt refinancing costs, especially as falling real incomes make those costs less affordable.", "This market volatility is being compounded by global financial spillovers (Chart 11).", "These come mainly from the United States[ ], but were also visible in the reaction of euro-denominated yields to the recent episode of market repricing in the United Kingdom.", "Global component in yields Correlation of sovereign bond yields in advanced economies, expectations components and term premia (correlation coefficient) Sources: Datastream and Haver Analytics.", "Notes: The sample consists of ten advanced economies (Australia, Canada, Denmark, euro area, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States).", "The bilateral correlation coefficients are averaged across these countries and time periods.", "The term premia and expectations components are the average of estimates from three models (dynamic Nelson-Siegel, rotated dynamic Nelson-Siegel and dynamic Svensson-Soderlind).", "The latest observations are for 21 October 2022 (daily data).", "In the euro area, an additional source of volatility is the risk of financial fragmentation along national lines, which can impair the homogenous transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.", "The current environment therefore requires us to be prudent in adjusting our monetary policy across all instruments.", "There are three key considerations here.", "First, our decisions and communication on the pace of normalisation should avoid amplifying market volatility.", "There is a case for frontloading our policy adjustment given the need to keep expectations anchored, especially in view of the very accommodative stance from which normalisation started.", "But such frontloading should remain commensurate to the benefits and risks it creates.", "When it comes to managing inflation expectations, ECB staff analysis finds that the benefits of surprising markets with bigger-than-expected rate increases is limited in the euro area.", "[ And if these bigger-than- expected increases are interpreted as signalling a higher terminal rate, rather than simply frontloading the normalisation, we could have a stronger impact on financing conditions - and ultimately on economic activity - than intended.", "Additionally, a bigger-than-expected rate increase may heighten volatility and have a stronger impact in the current highly leveraged environment after a decade of very low rates and ample liquidity.", "So when calibrating our stance, we need to pay close attention to ensuring that we do not amplify the risk of a protracted recession or trigger market dislocation.", "[ Second, we must be clear about the sequencing of the normalisation process.", "We should avoid \"cliff effects\", continually monitor the market response to our measures and consider the feedback between our different instruments.", "Currently, our policy rate remains a suitable marginal instrument of normalisation.", "It is the instrument we know best.", "We have a comparatively limited understanding of the effects of reducing the size of our balance sheet.", "[ The size of our balance sheet will be significantly reduced as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) mature and banks likely make early repayments after the decision we took last week to adapt the TLTROs' terms and conditions to the current monetary policy context.", "We should take the necessary time to assess the impact of our rate hikes and of phasing out the TLTROs.", "As we normalise our monetary policy, we should expect bank lending conditions to tighten.", "What we need to avoid, though, is a sudden stop in the supply of credit to the broad economy.", "We should ensure that TLTRO repayments have been absorbed before we stop fully reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under our purchase programmes.", "And when considering how we would then reduce the size of our bond portfolios, a controlled reduction - whereby only redemptions above a cap are not rolled over - is preferable to active sales, which may unsettle markets in an already volatile financial environment.", "[ Third, we must ensure the smooth transmission of our stance as we normalise monetary policy.", "Maintaining ample liquidity in the system will help ensure smooth money market functioning.", "This will allow us to continue tightly steering money markets through changes in our deposit facility rate.", "But preserving smooth transmission also means being ready to intervene in a timely manner to counter unwarranted market dysfunctions, should they arise.", "Our reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme -
