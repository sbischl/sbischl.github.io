{"sentences": ["Honorable, According to Article 3 of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia Act, the Central Bank is responsible for the stability of the domestic currency, the monetary policy and the overall domestic and international payments liquidity in the Republic of Macedonia.", "Furthermore, the National Bank, within its rights and duties, is responsible for providing and preserving sound banking system of the Republic of Macedonia.", "Given such defined legal duties and taking into account achievements in this area, it may be concluded that in 2000 the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, acting in compliance with the given rights, accomplished its legal duties.", "Stability of the domestic currency The stability of the domestic currency may be observed from two aspects: \u2022 Stability of the internal value of the Denar.", "It is expressed through its purchasing power, i.e.", "the price stability in the Republic of Macedonia; and \u2022 Stability of the

2000 / December 1999), measured through the retail prices index equals 10.8%.", "Measured through the costs of living index, as agreed with the IMF arrangement, the inflation in 2000 equaled 6.1%.", "In 2000, compared to the previous several years, the inflation is higher, however it should be underlined that the reason for that is not the monetary policy, but the impact of the non-monetary factors.", "These factors are the following: \u2022 one-time effect of the introduction of the value-added tax on prices; \u2022 increase in the price of oil on the world markets, accompanied with the appreciation of the US \u2022 increase in the price of electricity and maintaining higher tariff for calculation of the price of the \u2022 increase in the prices of particular services which are under direct control of the government However, it is crucial that the potential fundamental generators of inflation such as the monetary policy, the fiscal policy, the exchange rate and the wages remained under control and coordination.", "Therefore, the Central Bank considers that the impact of the non-monetary factors that gave rise to the inflation in 2000 are of temporary character and that in 2001 the inflation will get back to the level from the previous several years.", "Thus, measured according to the costs of living index, the annual rate of inflation in 2001 on December basis (December 2001 / December 2000) is projected to equal 1.2%.", "In that sense, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia will continue with its intention to preserve that inflation rate to low, stable and predictable level, which is in compliance with the empirically confirmed knowledge that the price stability creates the most favorable macroeconomic environment for accelerated, long-term sustainable economic growth.", "The second aspect of the domestic currency stability is preserving the stability of the Denar exchange rate.", "The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia managed to preserve the nominal exchange rate of the Denar against the Deutsche Mark at the targeted level of Denar 31 per 1 Deutsche Mark.", "The exchange rate stability was preserved, despite the developments on the foreign exchange market, where the supply significantly exceeded the demand for foreign currency.", "As a result, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia intervened on the foreign exchange market in order to prevent the appreciation of the domestic currency - Denar.", "From the beginning of the year to December 31, 2000, net-amount of USD 190.1 million was purchased on the foreign exchange market.", "Relating other currencies, the Denar fluctuated according to the changes of the exchange rate of the Deutsche Mark against these currencies on the world markets.", "In 2000, in order to achieve the price stability as its primary objective, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia successfully implemented the monetary strategy of targeting the nominal exchange rate of the Denar against the Deutsche Mark.", "Hence, the Central Bank aimed the money supply at preserving the exchange rate stability as a nominal anchor in the economy.", "Thus, the stock of money supply was sized according to the needs for regular execution of financial transactions in the economy.", "It should be underlined that in the first half of 2000, the money supply registered considerably high annual growth rates, while in the second half of the year they slowed down, due to the high comparison base from the previous year.", "Thus, in June 2000, the money supply M2 - Denar component compared to the same month of the previous year, was by 24.4% higher, while in December 2000, compared to December 1999 was higher by 17.5%.", "At the end of December 2000, the broadest money supply aggregate M4 registered annual growth rate of 21.7%.", "Considerable challenge for the NBRM in 2000, was the high amount of foreign currency purchased by the Central Bank on the foreign exchange market, which exceeded the projections.", "Nevertheless, the close coordination between the monetary and fiscal policy and the high growth of the government deposits with the NBRM adequately sterilized the monetary effects of the Central Bank foreign exchange transactions.", "The higher purchase of foreign currency on the foreign exchange market acted towards increase in the NBRM gross foreign exchange reserves.", "In 2000, the upward trend of the deposits with the banks continued due to the gradual strengthening of the confidence of the economic agents in the banking sector.",

banks' credits in favor of the non-government sector (according to the actual balance) increased by Denar 6,042 million, or by 17.2%.", "A good and close coordination between the monetary and fiscal policy created a room for such an increase in the credits, significant increment in the liquidity of the banks, removal of the credit ceilings by the NBRM and increased banks' deposit potential.",

banks' Denar credits increased by Denar 7,463 million, or by 27.8%.", "The increase was primarily due to the abolishment of the credit limits of the banks' Denar placements at the end of March 2000, which was a period of significant credit expansion.", "It should be underlined that according to the supervisory examinations of the NBRM, the newly extended credits are granted to good clients.", "In December 2000, compared to the same month of 1999, the banks' foreign currency placements to the nongovernment sector decreased by Denar 1,421 million, or by 17.2%.", "The fall was primarily due to the higher attractiveness of the banks' Denar credits due to the higher interest rates.", "At the end of March 2000, the NBRM continued with further reforms of the monetary policy instruments, where the abolishment of the credit ceilings being the most significant one.", "Hence, the transition to indirect market-oriented instruments for monetary regulation has entirely been completed.", "Moreover, the existing monetary instruments have been improved in order to be modern and closer to those used in developed market economies.", "Within the framework of continuous and intensive efforts to lower the banks' interest rates, the NBRM, in April 2000, decreased the discount rate and the Lombard credit interest rate by one percentage points, thus reducing them to 7.9% and 17.5% p.a.", "Domestic and International payments liquidity in the Republic of Macedonia In 2000, the liquidity of the banking system considerably improved.", "In January - December 2000, compared to the

regulation.", "The most utilized instrument will be the CB bills auction, which will serve for dynamic regulation of the liquidity of the banking sector.", "Regarding the changes in the monetary

governance, on one hand, as well as by the continuous strict supervision examination on the banks operations by the Central Bank, on the other hand.", "Foreign exchange reserves, balance of payments In 2001, the Central Bank's net purchase of foreign currency on the foreign exchange market, together with the movements in the government external account with the NBRM and the inflow based on
