the highest rate in more than 30 years.", "This was accompanied by low or moderate inflation and growing macroeconomic stability.", "Then the region was hit by two global economic shocks, the sharp increases in food and energy prices of late 2007 and early 2008, and the onset of the recession later in 2008.", "The crisis came at a time when subSaharan Africa was in a much better shape than it had ever been before, and was resolutely heading for higher growth and faster poverty reduction.", "Although, at the beginning, the effects of the crisis were not felt, given the limited integration of the African financial system with the global financial system, their second round impacted negatively on macroeconomic convergence and regional financial integration efforts.", "This led many to argue that the process of regional financial integration should be delayed or put on hold while awaiting better times.", "This view has been reinforced by the recent geopolitical tensions in the North African region, which has added grist to the mill of the confirmed Africa-skeptics who point out that Africa heads the hit-parade of failed states.", "For the optimists, the crisis brings new opportunity as Ms Antoinette Sayeh, - coming herself from a failed state, and now Director, of the African Department of the International Monetary Fund - said in a speech entitled \"Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges for 2010\" at The Brooklyn Institution (November 2009) : \"...new engines to drive strong growth will be needed in the post-crisis period.", "Measures to improve the business environment, develop well-regulated capital markets, increase labor productivity, and enhance efficiency in the public sector will be crucial\".", "Policymakers therefore face the daunting challenge of coming up with key policies aimed at reducing gaps, inequality and income differences across the region in order to transform it into regional single markets and regional production bases that are fully integrated and more competitive in the global economy.", "Melding the different countries into a regional bloc, with free movement of goods, services, skilled labor and free flow of capital, implies that there will be an increasing flow of funds, or payments, between economic agents in different countries and greater cross-border trading of securities.", "FMIs, that are harmonized, standardized, inter-operable, and inter-linkable, are fundamental requirements to achieve truly integrated markets in the region.", "While I am convinced that this is the way forward for Africa, I am perfectly aware of the many hurdles that that need to be overcome before this kind of ambition can become a reality.", "For example, the efficient functioning of a payments and settlement system, a vital component of FMIs, relies on the appropriate infrastructure being put in place i.e.", "telecommunications, acceptance networks, internet access etc.", "While many countries in the African region have made significant efforts towards implementing RTGS systems, in setting up ATMs, or effecting payments through mobiles, many still lack reliable telecommunications, good road networks, or even electricity.", "Another area that requires attention would be region-wide regulatory frameworks, and adequate supervision to keep pace with the expansion of cross-border banking and other financial services areas.", "Financial market infrastructure in Mauritius That's enough about the continent for this morning.", "Let me tell you a few words on our own efforts to enhance our FMI.", "In spite of the smallness of our economy, the FMI in Mauritius is quite developed.", "It has gone through a series of transformations over the years.", "These were made possible because we could piggy-back on state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure, providing global connectivity.", "As we welcomed global players in our jurisdiction and as our economy developed, the Mauritian financial system became increasingly integrated with international financial markets.", "On the downside, we also became increasingly exposed to the risk of instability, and more vulnerable to external shocks.", "The Bank of Mauritius has the responsibility to ensure the stability and soundness of the financial system of the country.", "While this financial stability role of the Bank is not a new one, it was brought into sharper focus by the legislative changes to the responsibilities of the Bank in 2004.", "In practice, the Bank would look at the robustness of the core financial infrastructure, which includes the payments and settlement system, and identify potential triggers, in times of stress, that could lead to a crisis.", "The safety of the payments and settlement system is a major concern for us not only because of the risks embedded in the system, but also because we are a fully-monetised economy where a small hiccup in the system can rapidly lead to a major economic disruption.", "Also, the payments and settlement system is the channel through which monetary policy is transmitted - failure of the payments and settlement system would translate into a failure of the monetary transmission mechanism and monetary policy would be ineffective.", "The Bank is concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of the payment system.", "As operator of the system, we have influenced its design and evolution.", "We directed our efforts to modernize the system, to make it more efficient, and more resilient to the risk of potential financial market instability.", "What distinguishes our payments and settlement system is that it is an integrated system.", "Our system has become a model for the region - we have been receiving a steady stream of delegations from other central banks in the region interested to look at its intricacies.", "Modernisation of our payments and settlement system The first phase of the modernization of our payments and settlement system started with the implementation of MACSS - the Mauritius Automated Clearing and Settlement System.", "It links electronically all banks operating in Mauritius as well as the Ministry of Finance to the Bank of Mauritius.", "MACSS was designed to use the SWIFT infrastructure as message carrier, instead of a private proprietary network, and was a premie\u0300re in the region at the time of its launch.", "MACSS processes over 2,000 transactions per day to a value of nearly Rs10 billion - or nearly 3% of our GDP.", "Then PLACH - the Port-Louis Clearing House - was automated, with the standardization of cheques using Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology and, in turn, PLACH piggy-backed on the MACSS communication network.", "Well before the global financial crisis had begun to unfold, I had zeroed in on the Payment Systems as a key contributor to financial stability and economic growth.", "I therefore decided - against quite some opposition - to create a division within the Bank, dedicated to payment system issues, as is the practice in most central banks.", "The establishment of the MCIB - Mauritius Credit Information Bureau - under the aegis of the Bank of Mauritius, was a key element of our FMI.", "MCIB is a public registry of borrower information and provides factual information on the creditworthiness of borrowers.", "It improved the provision of credit information.", "It was also instrumental in lowering the ratio of non-performing loans in banks.", "In other words, it improved the quality of banks' loan portfolio.", "While we have been busy warding off pressing unsolicited offers to acquire it from us, we have also been constantly expanding the coverage of MCIB.", "In 2009, we replaced the MACSS software with a new application based on international best practice.", "It is built on a more resilient architecture and supports multi-currency transactions including payment of tax bills in foreign currency.", "Our RTGS is certified \"SWIFT Gold Label\" and we are the only country in the region to have a multi-currency RTGS.", "There was still a missing component in our payments landscape - we did not have a proper automated clearing system for low-value payments.", "These make up the bulk of the payment transactions in our economy.", "Last December, for example, we cleared a record number of cheques: 562,000 of them in an amount of Rs29.4 billion -
