development across the globe.", "Let us first remind ourselves that distributed ledgers at its core, is a computer protocol that allows many participants to record information on a single ledger that is shared among users, so each one sees the same data.", "The best-known application of distributed ledgers is Bitcoin, which is a decentralized digital currency that is an internet-based medium of exchange.", "I want to draw the distinction between this and other forms of Fintech, which is broadly defined as the application of computer programmes and other technology used to support or enable financial services.", "There are three key differences that we need to be cognisant of related to recent innovations in Fintech, compared to prior technological improvements: The first being the fact that today's Fintech is being more heavily driven from outside of the financial landscape, as opposed to being led by the traditional market intermediaries.", "Companies such as Apple and Google via Apple Pay and Google Wallet are responding to customers' demands and aiding the advancement by offering lower transaction costs and more convenient personalised services that leverage the use of smartphones and speedy settlement.", "All of these are closely aligned with the desire for and expectation of instantaneous access to goods and money.", "Whereas historically financial innovation in retail financial services resulted in the traditional banking intermediaries remaining dominant players and adopting the technology to suit their needs, this is no longer the case for some of the new technology, which sets the stage for a definitive shift that no central bank can ignore.", "The second difference is that the invention of distributed ledger technology is now driving the necessity.", "Unlike Plato's saying \"Necessity is the mother of invention\", institutions and firms are now searching for, and discovering new ways by which distributed ledger technology can be applied to their day-to-day operations.", "It is important to also note that not all Fintech innovations aimed at enhancing efficiency are driven by distributed ledger technology.", "The third difference - According

this change likely to be disruptive?", "What is yet to be determined about this new technology?", "Advocates for distributed ledgers suggest that the technology could create disruption within the financial services industry by making processes more efficient, whether related to cross-border payments or digital identities, making it the next biggest innovation since the Internet.", "From a

transactions continue to thrive in the current system, despite the anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism regulations.", "At present, the majority of banking systems are housed on centralized databases, making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks since all the information is stored in one place, and some banking systems are out-dated and susceptible to new forms of cyber-attacks.", "Given that the distributed ledger technology stores, encrypts and verifies every single bit of data in a transaction, any data breach, fraudulent activity, or trades with flagged entities would be made immediately obvious to all parties who have permission to access the data on the ledger.", "This is especially pertinent since data stored on a blockchain is immutable and irreversible therefore the risk of duplication or errors would be greatly minimized.", "Furthermore, regulators would quickly realize the benefits of easily auditing and tracking all financial transactions.", "Various studies have determined that by employing the use of distributed ledger technology for Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, banks would not only reduce operational and compliance costs, but also increase the efficiency of their compliance processes.", "Using the technology, access to KYC data can be shared by banks and accredited organizations would have no need for a duplicated KYC process.", "Ironically, a Goldman Sachs report noted that a 10% reduction in staff could be achieved with the introduction of blockchain technology in KYC procedures, which would equate to US$160 million in annual cost-savings.", "Therefore, the response to that very popular question, \"Does distributed ledger technology represent an Evolution or Revolution?\"", "really

implications for monetary policy, payment execution and net clearing and settlement - are yet to be fully assessed.", "In reality, no one yet knows what the social and economic payoffs to these realities will be.", "It is conceptually interesting to fathom an alternative future, such as one in which there is complete disintermediation of banks and even central banks, with state currencies being replaced by decentralized digital currencies.", "However, the reality is that some form of cash is still likely to be retained, since it allows for reliable 'redundancy' support.", "At a recent forum a very vivid example was provided, \"...even though we have the benefit of LED lights and energy efficient appliances, when the electricity goes off, we resort to candles and flashlights.\"", "The reliance on cash is no different, as we were recently reminded in the face of our regional neighbours' natural disasters, when there was mobile phone connectivity or access to online banking services.", "In short, digital currencies still have a competitive disadvantage as a store of value and medium of exchange, compared to traditional means.", "As such, even though it is foreseeable

and protect Cyber Security Concerns data privacy.", "To address innovation in financial services, there must be active engagement between authorities and the private sector.", "For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore engages in official regulatory sandboxes, where for a predetermined period regulatory requirements are relaxed, to allow an assessment of the impact and inherent risks of start-up companies.", "This level of experimentation with technology-driven entities is aimed at ensuring that economic opportunities are not foregone by creating the space to explore innovation.", "This is something that the Central Bank of Barbados has received a proposal for and is now considering.", "In closing, what is evident today is that: Innovation in Fintech could have a net positive
