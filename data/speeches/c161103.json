financing infrastructure in Asian countries as part of One Belt One Road plan, it is timely to enhance the strategies moving forward.", "I would suggest to look at a few key aspects: 1.", "The first is to increase the stock of renminbi liquidity onshore.", "With a stable and larger renminbi liquidity pool, banks will be able to offer renminbi loans and financing.", "Currently, the RMB deposit

to learn from our baht-ringgit cross currency market framework that we developed with our Thailand counterpart by appointing market makers, which are given certain flexibilities to facilitate doing business.", "A similar framework could also be considered for the renminbi ringgit cross currency markets.", "This will enable the market maker banks to play a larger role in enhancing the renminbi FX activities, not only in the spot market, but also in the renminbi forward and swap markets, which will result in lower foreign exchange transaction cost to the real sector.", "Another area that we are developing is to introduce a flexible hedging framework for residents to hedge their foreign exchange exposures up to a certain limit.", "This framework is specifically made available for the USD/MYR

should be given special attention.", "For corporations which trade predominantly with China, there are many benefits to settle trade in renminbi, in particular, lower foreign exchange conversion costs and greater access to new markets in China.", "In switching to renminbi, corporations should review on the internal changes required, such as invoicing and trade documentation in renminbi, accounting and any other operational procedures, including engaging banks which are able to provide advice and facilitate trade financing in renminbi.", "Banks need to be ready in this area, to develop the system to support the trade financing and to be familiar and current with the rules and regulations of the Chinese authorities.", "Further improvement should be looked into to entice more participation, and efficient ways should be explored to ease trade facilitation in renminbi.", "In another aspect, this space can also capitalise on another work area of the Financial Market Committee in looking at the introduction of a more standardised documentation requirement across industry.", "Coupled with the broader and more flexible trade financing facilities and hedging tools, this will create a more business-friendly market which will in turn amplify participation.", "Last but not least, is to develop investment products in renminbi.", "In the past, the efforts in promoting the use
