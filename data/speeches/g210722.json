The traditional bank intermediation model - The non-bank financial intermediation model implemented by the asset management sector - A so-called \"re-intermediated\" model in which Fintechs and Bigtechs play the role of intermediary for banks, in particular vis-a\u0300-vis retail clients - A completely disintermediated model based on Blockchain technology I will not venture to forecast the weight that the traditional bank intermediation model will have at the end of this transformation.", "This will depend in particular on banks' ability to rise to the challenges they face, notably in terms of profitability and technology, and to adapt the services they offer to the digital era but also on the fight against climate change.", "Nonetheless, this transformation seems to me to clearly imply adjusting our regulatory framework for all activities that will contribute to financial intermediation in the future.", "These transformations will have a positive impact on the efficiency and stability of our financial system, provided they are accompanied by better user experiences and more diversified financing of the economy.", "But they also carry risks, which must be managed.", "This implies reviewing the scope and content of certain regulations to ensure that the regulatory framework is favourable to innovation and neutral with respect to technologies, but also guarantees an appropriate and homogeneous treatment of risks throughout the financial system according to the \"same activity, same risk, same rules\" principle.", "non-bank financial players, technology service providers, issuers and managers of crypto asset trading platforms) Thank you for your attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Financial intermediation", "Bank intermediation", "Non-bank financial intermediation", "Tech companies", "Fintechs", "Bigtechs", "Blockchain", "Financial stability", "Financial regulation", "Risk management"]}
