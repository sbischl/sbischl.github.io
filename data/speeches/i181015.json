it strengthens monetary transmission channels; and it reduces unintended consequences of monetary policy actions.", "But the reverse is also true: a weak financial system can cost monetary policymakers many sleepless nights.", "Second, against the background of a monetary environment that is likely to remain accommodative for some time, we therefore need to further strengthen the global financial system.", "And to do that, we need to further improve the regulatory framework in the coming years.", "I will argue that the financial system is in much better shape than a decade ago, but important risks still remain.", "I will argue that international regulatory authorities firstly need to maintain strict micro- and macroprudential regulation; secondly, must seek further improvements in policy implementation; and thirdly, should adapt to risks shifted outside their perimeter.", "Causes of the crisis and policy responses Let me briefly recall the financial, economic and policy circumstances which allowed the global financial crisis to develop.", "Causes of the crisis In the decades before the crisis, the global financial system changed profoundly.", "This was the result of deregulation, increasing competitive pressures on banks and increasing financial globalization.", "These trends have led to a greater role for market finance and a stronger interconnectedness within the financial system.", "During the same period, the macroeconomic environment underwent important structural changes.", "This happened on the back of accelerating globalization, the emergence of new players like China, and technological progress.", "Against this background, large global flows of savings and investments pushed down long-term interest rates, in the United States and other advanced economies.", "Accommodative monetary policies further allowed for financial risk-taking.", "It has been argued that the \"Great Moderation\" allowed a leverage build-up that ultimately threatened financial stability and hence macroeconomic stability.", "In the regulatory policy sphere, a widespread trend towards deregulation loosened the reins on risk-taking in the financial sector.", "Microprudential supervision was not well equipped to address this increased risk-taking.", "In addition, macroprudential orientation of regulatory policy addressing systemic risk was almost completely absent at that time.", "In this environment, misaligned incentives prompted widespread risk-taking in the financial system.", "In combination with high economic growth, important imbalances developed.", "When the crisis erupted, banks did not have sufficient capital to absorb losses and authorities were not adequately prepared to handle failing banks.", "The imbalances spread almost instantaneously across the global financial system, as a result of the interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets.", "These patterns are not specific to the global financial crisis, as economic historians have documented.", "Typically, financial crises are preceded by booms where factors like high growth, innovation and increased risk taking interact.", "In a very recent paper Ben Bernanke introduces yet another element: the excessive reliance of financial institutions on short-term wholesale funding.", "This new element explains why the global financial crisis was more extreme, and why it had more severe effects on the real economy.", "Policy responses When the crisis erupted we needed new policy toolkits.", "In the last ten years, therefore, a comprehensive reform program has been developed, under the leadership of the G20, the Financial Stability Board, and the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision.", "The reforms have made financial institutions better equipped to deal with future shocks.", "Thanks to these reforms, banks hold significantly more capital, which is more readily and easily available to absorb losses.", "Banks also have stronger liquidity positions and have strengthened their governance and risk management.", "Prudential policies increasingly include a macroprudential orientation with a For a recent analysis of this mechanism, see B.
