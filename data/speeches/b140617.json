has remained at this level ever since.", "The European Central Bank also started a series of reductions of its Main Refinancing Operations (MRO) rate.", "With little or no room for further interest rate reductions, the central banks in developed countries turned their attention to highly unconventional measures, previously regarded as inconsistent with the inflation targeting paradigm.", "The objective of these measures was to maintain financial liquidity and stability.", "However, the move towards longer-term maturities was also designed to flatten the yield curve and stimulate real investment.", "In November 2008 the Federal Reserve started the first round of quantitative easing and began to buy a wide class of assets, including mortgage-backed securities, long-term government debt and bank debt.", "By mid-2010 the stock of these assets at the FED reached 2.1 trillion dollars.", "In the second round, it bought another 600 bln USD.", "Similar non-standard measures have been

spillovers.", "One new line of theoretical research points to positive effects of international spillovers.", "If country-specific shocks have global repercussions and intermediaries in both countries face similar balance sheet constraints (think USA and the Euro area), a policy implemented in one county will help the other one as well.", "However, if these policies are costly, they may lead to a free-rider problem in which both countries wait for the policy being implemented in the other.", "These predictions seem to be confirmed empirically, at least in the US case.", "The first round of QE seems to have substantially reduced bond yields not only in the US, but also in Germany, Japan and the UK.", "It also contributed to the weakening of the US dollar, although the impact on net exports is a bit harder to assess.", "The evidence for ECB policy spillovers is, on the other hand, much weaker.", "This may in part be due to the fact that the European Central Bank focused on reducing
