Insurance Corporation's 2021 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households found that 95.5 percent of all U.S. households were banked, which is the highest level since the survey began in

system, whether from a distrust of the banking system or prior mishandling of a banking relationship being an impediment to account ownership.", "These broader gains in the number of consumers with bank accounts are an important measure of our collective success, particularly in an environment where consumers can access an ever-growing range of financial services.", "While there are a multitude

accounts.", "These accounts are now available at more than 46,000 U.S. bank and credit union branches.", "Like affordable banking services, responsible small-dollar lending products can play an important role in financial inclusion by helping meet immediate credit needs from emergency or unexpected expenses, temporary cash flow disruptions, or unplanned income shortfalls.", "Small-dollar loans are often a critical source of funding when economic stress occurs.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve and other agencies issued updated principles for banks to consider when offering responsible small-dollar loans.", "Successful programs incorporate repayment safeguards and seek to provide outcomes that enhance borrowers' financial capabilities.", "As loan markets continue to evolve, well-designed small-dollar loan products remain an important resource for consumers, helping to encourage positive credit practices and transition into additional financial products.", "I will conclude with a key element of the Federal Reserve's community engagement to broaden access to financial services so that more Americans can participate in the broader economy.",

functions work to advance this goal.", "The Federal Reserve Board's Community Advisory Council offers diverse perspectives on economic circumstances and financial services needs of a range of consumers and communities, with a particular focus on low- and moderate-income populations.", "The Community Advisory Council has benefited from having representation from the Native American Indian community serving on the council and updating the members on current challenges and opportunities facing these communities.", "In addition, in 2021, the Federal Reserve joined the Central Bank Network

education.", "In fact, the St. Louis Fed's Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment program has provided economic and personal finance education for Native communities and organizations
