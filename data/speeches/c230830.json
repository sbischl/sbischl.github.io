whether goods from parts of East Asia or gas from Russia - in order to \"de-risk\" trade.", "However, one should be careful not to over-generalise.", "The fact that they've both involved significant interruptions to the supply of traded goods doesn't mean these two episodes have the same implications for trade policy.", "Nor should we imagine that, just because they're global, the economic consequences of these shocks - for either real income or inflation - have been identical in every country.", "The argument that trade has been over-concentrated - and that governments have a role to play in addressing the problem - is surely reasonable when it comes to Europe's (pre-war) reliance on Russian gas.", "Arguably, the security of energy supply is something for which governments should and do take some responsibility.", "(There are significant increasing returns in the physical infrastructure and therefore an economic case for the involvement of public policy.", "It's also an area in which political risk is ubiquitous: this isn't the first time a monopolistic producer has restricted the supply of energy for political ends[1].)", "And although this reliance was considerable - and clearly not costless to replace - there's nothing intrinsically special (or \"non-substitutable\") about Russian gas in particular: one molecule of methane is much like another.", "It's not clear the same is true of supplies of goods affected by the pandemic.", "The extensive global value chains (GVCs) built up during the 1990s and 2000s have almost certainly increased economic inter-dependence[2].", "There's little doubt either that, at least in the face of this very particular and very severe shock, the dispersed and specialised nature of production worsened the hit to the supply of goods during the pandemic.", "But the shortages and price rises weren't just because of supply problems.", "Covid-19 also led to a material rise in the global demand for goods, as consumers in many countries shifted spending away from services.", "Even a closed economy would have had trouble adapting to a switch in demand on this scale.", "Nor was the pandemic a typical shock.", "Some warn they could become more common in future.", "But over the past, at least, there's little evidence that greater openness has led to greater volatility in economic growth -

we think the process will take longer - and, therefore, that policy will probably have to remain in restrictive territory for quite some time yet.", "Anyhow, having picked off some of the main points in this introduction I'll now fill in some of the details.", "I'll begin with some remarks about trade.", "The second main section is about the effects of the real-income squeeze on domestic inflation and the prospects for a reversal of these \"second-round effects\" now that the real price of imported goods and energy prices has started to decline.", "I close with some remarks about the behaviour of monetary policy in the presence of these sorts of shocks.", "The global supply of traded goods and UK income It's now common knowledge that the huge expansion in world trade, during the latter part of the last century and the first years of this one, then petered out around the time of the global financial crisis (GFC).", "Globalisation gave way to \"slowbalisation\".", "The share of trade accounted for by GVCs, whose growth had been the main engine of the long expansion, levelled out around the same time (Chart 6).", "Unsurprisingly, the same pattern can be observed for many individual countries.", "In the UK, during the fifteen years from the early 1990s until the GFC, the share of imports in domestic spending almost doubled.", "World trade, per cent of world G 1980 1990 2000 2010 Sources: ONS, World Bank Development Indicators, Borin and Mancini (2019) -_as reported in World Development Report (2020) and Antras (2020) and Bank calculations.World trade is defined as the sum of world exports and imports of goods and services as a share of world GDP in value terms, divided by two as a country's import is another country's export.", "Some have blamed the subsequent flattening out in trade shares on more restrictive policy[6].", "That may be true to some extent.", "But the more accurate description is that the rate of liberalisation slowed down, not that policy turned significantly more restrictive.", "Thanks to a succession of regional agreements, progress on multilateral rules and, in 2001, China's accession to the WTO, average tariff rates declined significantly in the years ahead of the GFC.", "In Europe, the EU's expansion, and the creation of the single market, removed many non-tariff barriers (Dhingra et al, 2022) I Perhaps it was always going to be difficult to maintain that rate of progress.", "And, as Antras (2020) argues, many other factors contributed to the expansion of trade and they too were always likely to run out of steam, or at least to decelerate, at some point.", "By dramatically reducing the costs of information exchange and improving the efficiency of supply chains, the ICT revolution also made it easier to disperse manufacturing across different countries.", "Political developments brought significant numbers of people -

compared, at least, with what had come before - the huge dislocations of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, against the backdrop of the UK's departure from the EU's single market and customs union, proved much worse.", "As we saw in the introduction, the jump in import prices between mid-2020 and mid-2022 reduced the consumption value of UK output by over 5%.", "As much as UK incomes had gained from the increased supply of tradable goods over the preceding decades -

is the NAIRU now declining (Chart 15 might suggest that the Beveridge curve has started to shift back to the left)?", "e improvements in real income, while they may help to blunt second-round effects, will also support demand in the economy; taking this into account, and the usual lags involved in monetary policy, will the prevailing level of interest rates be enough to ensure further rises in spare capacity in the economy, including the rate of unemployment?", "None of these questions is straightforward and individual Committee members have differing views about them.", "Collectively, the MPC has been relatively cautious about the first.", "Partly because real import prices have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, we suspect any unwinding of the second- round effects on domestic inflation will be more gradual than their emergence over the past eighteen months.", "On the second, it's hard to tell whether some of these other labour-market indicators have predictive power for wages for a given rate of unemployment.", "There hasn't been enough differentiation in their behaviour, prior to this episode, to tell the difference.", "There are some straws in the wind.", "Chart 19 plots private-sector wage growth against a relatively longstanding survey measure, an index produced by a body representing recruitment agencies.", "This suggests that, at least for new employees, wage growth has declined.", "But as you can see, in the past few months official estimates have been significantly stronger than this survey measure would have suggested, so one can only be cautious in this respect[13}.", "REC indicator of staff permanent staff salaries is mean-variance adjusted to match wage growth over 2002-19.", "REC indicator 12-month lag gives best correlation with 12-month wage growth over 2002-19.", "As for the third, the MPC's latest forecast implies that policy is tight enough to offset the positive influence on demand from improving real income and that spare capacity will widen.", "But here too the proof of the pudding will be in the eating of it: policy will respond to the evidence on spare capacity, and to indicators of domestic inflation, as and when it comes through.", "Summary and conclusion It's sometimes presumed that the economic gains from trade come at the price of greater economic volatility.", "At least as far as aggregate output is concerned it's not clear this is the case.", "In the longer-run UK history, periods of greater openness have generally coincided with lower variance of output growth.", "A more careful recent study finds the same for many countries over the past half-century.", "It's possible that, while it might encourage greater specialisation, and therefore a country's exposure to sectoral disturbances, openness to trade also dampens the impact of those on domestic demand and productivity.", "In an open economy national income depends not just on GDP but what that output can buy on global markets.", "In the UK's more recent history there have been significant shifts in these relative prices.", "In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, a period of rapid globalisation, import costs fell markedly (relative to wages and the price of domestic output), boosting real incomes.", "Over the following few years they then levelled out, mirroring the wider pattern in global trade.", "The early part of this decade, from mid-2020 to mid-2022, saw dramatic rises in import prices.", "The pandemic boosted the demand for tradable goods and impaired their supply; Russia's export cuts led to a ten-fold rise in the price of European gas.", "Against the backdrop of its departure from the European single market and customs union, which itself has raised the costs of trade, these shocks knocked close to 6% from the consumption value of UK output during that two-year period.", "One possible conclusion from experiences is that it's wrong to be so reliant on imported goods - particularly from a single source - to begin with.", "When it comes to Europe's pre-war reliance on Russian energy this makes sense.", "Certainly the fragility of Russia's energy supply, if it wasn't apparent before the war, is clear enough today.", "Thankfully, Europe's energy prices have fallen back sharply since last summer's highs.", "In large part this reflects concerted efforts, including by governments, to replace imports from Russia with liquefied gas from other countries.", "The \"fragility\" of global supply chains, said to have been exposed by the pandemiic, is less obvious.", "The pandemic was as much a story of higher demand for goods as it was one of lower supply.", "The restrictions in the flow of goods were widespread - they existed not just between but within countries - and would have impaired that supply even if production had been less dispersed.", "Judging by the retreat in many of their prices over the past year, global value chains have actually proved relatively robust.", "There may be good political reasons - political imperatives, even - to repatriate production in some strategic areas.", "But it's not clear the experience of the pandemic provides an additional reason for doing so.", "Either way, the experience of an open economy like the UK provides a stark illustration of the cost of a sudden contraction in the supply of traded goods.", "Together with a tight labour market, the resulting squeeze on income is likely to have contributed to the sharp rise in domestic inflation and the consequent tightening of monetary policy.", "Over time, the more recent decline in import prices will alleviate some of this pressure.", "But it's unlikely that these \"second-round\" effects will unwind as rapidly as they emerged.", "As such, monetary policy may well have to remain in restrictive territory for some time yet.", "I've received helpful comments from colleagues at the Bank of England.", "I'd like to thank Shaheen Bhikhu, Aydan Dogan, John Lewis, Ellen Kockum, Doug Rendle, Nickie Shadbolt, Roger Vicquery, Teresa Vukovits-Votzi, and especially Fabrizio Cadamagnani, Simon Lloyd and Rana Sajedi for their help in preparing the speech.", "I'd also like to thank Pol Antras, Solomos Solomou and Alan Taylor for help with data.", "The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England.", "The big rise in oil prices in 1973 was the result of an embargo by OPEC targeted at countries that had supported Israel in the Yom Kippur war.", "Chapter 4 of World Bank (2020) _ has more on the effects of global value chains on cross-country correlations in economic growth and inflation.", "Domestic gas and electricity prices in the UK are set by the regulator (OFGEM) using a formula that depends on the lagged, forward price of gas in wholesale markets.", "This is the case even for suppliers who generate electricity using other sources of energy.", "Retail prices have been capped by government subsidies in recent months.", "But this was no more generous than in other European countries.", "So the greater sensitivity to gas prices has still been apparent and, because of the lags involved in the regulatory formula, the response of retail to wholesale prices has also been more drawn out in the UK.", "In the first quarter of this year, domestic energy utility inflation was 89%yoy in the UK, compared with 16% in the Euro area and 13% in the US.", "The last, hatched bar in Chart 3 exaggerates the scale of this effect as it's calculated on an annualised basis and covers only half a year (2022Q4 and 2023Q1).", "But more recent data indicate that this trend has continued since the first quarter.", "I discuss this point further in the body of the talk.", "My focus today is on aggregate measures rather than distributional questions.", "But, as an aside, we should not imagine that rising income inequality during the 1990s and 2000s, in much of the developed world, was caused primarily by globalisation: most studies attribute more to technological developments.", "In this respect it's notable that the Gini coefficient in the United States has risen by more in the \"slowbalisation\" years, since the 2008 financial crisis, than in the decade or so beforehand (for what it's worth, the Gini coefficient for household income in the UK has been broadly flat throughout the past thirty years).", "Nor should we ignore the more favourable distributional consequences of falling import prices.", "As it happens, these declines, during the hyper-globalisation years, were concentrated in things that were a bigger share of spending of the less well off (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2016 8.", "The strength of productivity growth may itself have been the result of greater openness, to a degree.", "There are many studies that find a positive link between the two (see, for example, Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) Bustos (2011) and Halpern et al.", "The strength of the effect depends on the degree of substitutability, in production, between home and foreign intermediate goods.", "For example, Rodrik (1998) Easterly et al.", "(2003) = and di Giovanni and Levchenko (2009) found that trade increases output volatility.", "Unemployment was supressed in Europe by furlough schemes, designed in keep people from losing jobs.", "The US chose instead to allow layoffs but to raise unemployment benefits.", "Chart 12 cuts off the full rise in US unemployment -
