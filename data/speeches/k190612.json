structure, the world quickly embraced globalization.", "Economies soon became more and more interconnected in terms of trade and financial transactions.", "Of course, while globalization has brought a

the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Fukuoka last weekend, in which Governor Visco and I took part.", "We had frank and meaningful discussions to share the experiences of each country, identify common challenges, and exchange views on possible policy responses to strengthen economic fundamentals for sustainable and inclusive growth.", "To take advantage of the benefits

arrangements are often made in alphabetical order, I usually sit next to Governor Visco and always enjoy his insights and wisdom, supported by the excellent economic and financial research of Banca d'Italia.", "Likewise, my old friend President Mario Draghi of the ECB was the Governor of Banca d'Italia from 2006 to 2011.", "He has worked together with the Bank of Japan and supported us in

came into force establishing an economic area with a population of 640 million people, accounting for almost 30 percent of world GDP and 40 percent of global trade.", "This EPA should enable an increase in and deepening of the trade and investment relationships among Italian and Japanese firms.", "Coming back to the name of the new era, the Chinese characters for \"Reiwa\" mean \"beautiful harmony,\" or more specifically \"culture is born and nurtured as people's hearts are beautifully drawn together.\"", "As we have reaped the fruits of the rapid globalization in the Heisei Era, the time is ripe to face up to the associated challenges so that we may continue to gain from globalization in the Reiwa Era.", "I truly hope that we can work together in \"beautiful harmony\" to further

Representative Office in Tokyo, and to thank all those who have made this possible.", "I look forward to a 40th, 50th, and many more anniversaries to come, as I am confident that we will continue to
