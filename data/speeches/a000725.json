43\u20444%.", "Last year the average was 1.6%.", "Put in context, this means that Irish inflation will be substantially beyond the average for the euro area this year.", "Nobody claims that inflation

productivity growth.", "The gap, however, has become too wide.", "Inflation is expected to go higher in the months ahead before it goes lower again.", "On favourable assumptions, especially in relation to energy prices, the Central Bank forecasts an average inflation rate of 33\u20444% in 2001.", "High and sustained services inflation could push this higher.", "Perhaps the greatest threat at the moment is a wage-price spiral that could get out of hand.", "The danger is that expectations might become detached from reality at a time when the economy's scope for increased output is diminishing because of supply constraints.", "It has been suggested that higher inflation may be a suitable route to a soft landing and that there may be no need to worry about inflation.", "This proposition, which undoubtedly has superficial appeal, overlooks the dynamics of the inflationary spiral that could lead to a very sharp deterioration.", "It also overlooks the difficulty of regaining competitiveness once it has been lost.", "It is not so long ago since the wage price spirals of the 1970s and 1980s resulted in high unemployment and emigration.", "In addition, this trend could

rate of 25% year-on-year.", "The overall stock of credit has been rising to the point where it is now roughly at the European average.", "This growth reflects confidence in the economy, strong growth and low interest rates.", "Residential and commercial property prices have accelerated at an alarming rate.", "Property prices, as a percentage of disposable income, are now at historically high levels.", "In the context of the concern about housing costs, there have been calls for restrictions on credit growth.", "There is no authority to impose restrictions as we might wish.", "The Central Bank contribution is to ensure that the lending institutions have made good provisions for the rainy day.", "In the past year the Bank has put emphasis on stress testing and we have advised the banks repeatedly to pay strict attention to risk management.", "We remain uneasy about the continuing upward spiral in property prices; apart from other considerations, this generates an inflation mentality.", "The recent initiatives on housing taken by Government are to be welcomed.", "I said earlier that the present rate of growth cannot be sustained.", "The Central Bank estimates that the economy could, however, sustain a growth rate of the order of 41\u20442-5%, which is impressive by any standard.", "It may be feasible to maintain exceptional growth for quite some time ahead through importing labour.", "In view of the existing congestion levels in urban centres and the acceleration in accommodation costs, it is questionable whether our infrastructure can cope with this.", "Besides, the longer the surge in growth, the greater the downside risks.", "A slowdown is inevitable in time.", "This can - and I expect that it will be - achieved in a smooth and orderly manner, provided there is wage and price restraint.", "A smooth transition will require careful management; it may involve some erosion of our competitive position vis-a\u0300-vis our main trading partners and the objective must be to minimise this.", "The Irish economy is one of the most open economies in the world.", "Last year, total trade - total exports and imports of goods and services - amounted to around 160% of GDP and this figure is expected to rise this year.", "Expressed as a percentage of GNP, this figure would be even higher.", "Because of this, developments in relation to competitiveness are particularly important for the Irish economy.", "May I now turn briefly to another aspect of the Central Bank's activities, namely the supervision of financial institutions.", "The number of financial entities that we supervise at present is of the order of 1,000.", "This includes 80 credit institutions, 600 investment intermediaries and 260 entities in the International Financial Services Centre.", "On top of this, we police about 2,000 funds in the Centre.", "There is legislation before the Oireachtas at the moment providing for the transfer of responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Bank.", "We are preparing for this transfer; I understand that the Bank will assume responsibility for up to 6,000 such intermediaries.", "In Europe, there is a gathering debate about the role of the Eurosystem in the supervision of the financial system.", "While the ESCB has a general involvement in supervision under the Maastricht Treaty, it does not have a day-to-day role.", "There is a potential for a more direct supervisory role under the Treaty but this would require a Council of Ministers decision.", "There is now a recognised gap in the system as there is nobody directly responsible for financial stability at euro area level.", "This debate is only beginning and I would be engaging in speculation if I went further on this subject.", "We are likely to see the emergence in due course of some European or euro area dimension to supervision.", "The Irish financial industry continues to grow successfully.", "The priority for the Central Bank is to provide a regulatory service for this industry that matches the best international standards.", "I believe that we are doing so.", "I believe that, in general, our financial industry is now strongly compliant.", "Unacceptable practices of earlier years, relating to taxation, have damaged the reputation of the industry.", "There is now an awareness and an acceptance, at senior management and board levels, of the need for greater emphasis on the proper conduct of affairs.", "It is important to appreciate the contribution which this industry makes to the Irish economy.", "About 45,000 people are employed in financial services here.", "These services now account for about 7% of GDP.", "The contribution from the International Financial Services Centre alone to the Irish economy is estimated in the region of \u00a31 billion.", "The financial services industry is going through a period of great change.", "This is due to a combination of factors, notably new technology and cross-border activity.", "Technology does not respect national boundaries and it is changing the whole environment.", "The latest phenomenon is internet banking which introduces new challenges for the regulator who must ensure that the interests of customers are safeguarded.", "Financial institutions are concerned that there be clarity from a legal and regulatory perspective.", "The Central Bank has adopted a very positive approach towards the use of the internet as a medium to provide services; a number of applications for licence or authorisation are being considered.", "Our local industry is under threat from centralisation within the European Union as the financial markets become more integrated.", "Investors have a preference for larger markets with greater liquidity.", "Up to 30 banks from the European Economic Area are now branching into Ireland.", "We cannot entirely dismiss the prospect that within a few years the Irish market could be dominated by foreign owned banks.", "Competition is growing more intense; there is a price to be paid and this is perhaps reflected in the recent closures of local branches which can no longer be subsidised.", "The Irish banks must be cost efficient in order to maintain their position.", "This is the background against which the regulator must operate.", "A high level of professionalism is demanded.", "We must aspire to having the highest standards of regulation.", "We must keep pace with international developments and much is happening internationally.", "In conclusion, may I draw attention to some figures in the Annual Report and Accounts of the Central Bank for 1999.", "The Bank's profits from its operations during 1999 were million.", "Of this, million is transferred to the Exchequer.", "At the end of last year, the Bank
