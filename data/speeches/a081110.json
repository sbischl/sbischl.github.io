percent.", "Moreover, this trend is set to accelerate, resulting in trade expansion both within ASEAN itself, and between ASEAN and the rest of the world.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, Today, the importance of ASEAN in the global economy cannot be denied.", "Size-wise, ASEAN population amounts to 565 million with growing middle class population, which means stronger demand for consumer

and wide.", "And its financial institutions must function as intermediaries to allocate funds effectively and efficiently.", "In the past, ASEAN relied on external source of funding, mainly from developed countries.", "At present, however, new polar source of funding has shifted towards Asia as well as ASEAN.", "Having well-developed financial system would enable ASEAN to better recycle its surplus capital among its members.", "For decades, ASEAN has used its banking system to manage resource allocation.", "Banking system worked fine in the past.", "However, in new and volatile financial environments, ASEAN needs to have both strong banking system as well as well-developed capital and bond markets to better service consumers' and businesses' financing needs.", "Having welldeveloped capital markets can allow financial risks in the economy to be spread out, shared, and more efficiently managed.", "And, the efficient allocation of financial resources would, in turn, allow ASEAN to have better access to capital and for its goods and services to flow in greater quantity.", "At the centre of building strong ASEAN finance is ensuring its continued systemic stability and ongoing market developments.", "In this regard, ASEAN central banks have a clear role in safeguarding price stability and financial institutions stability.", "On price stability, let me just say that ASEAN generally has a good track record of keeping inflation low.", "As for financial stability, the framework of policy has moved toward risk-based supervision, and to an adherence to international standards.", "Indeed, many ASEAN countries have significantly advanced efforts in implementing Basel II and FSAP, which have fostered a stronger and more balanced financial system with greater transparency.", "Maintaining financial stability also means that ASEAN must be able to withstand the ebbs and flows of foreign capital.", "But, as small open economies, keeping balances over any length of time is easier said than done.", "For ASEAN, avoiding capital account crises will become increasingly more important because the more ASEAN trade with each other, the more closely linked our

to restore investors' confidence.", "At this juncture, I doubt if any one can predict with any good accuracy when this episode of financial market turbulence would come to an end.", "The current global financial crisis reminds us of the lessons we learnt from the Asian financial crisis just one decade back.", "Indeed, what have happened in advanced economies today are stark reminders of those lessons learnt in Asia.", "Just like Asia, investors took excessively high risks creating asset price bubbles in advanced economies.", "Lax prudential policy, along with fragility of the financial system, quickly brought on a crisis of confidence, starting with debt defaults.", "Credit underwriting behaviors of financial institutions and credit rating agencies are being questioned along with imprudent lending practices and the bloating real estate sector.", "Thus far, the effects on emerging market economies in Asia have been minimal.", "Nevertheless, we are still awaiting final moments of truth as there will be a number of aftershocks following the financial tsunami.", "Clearly, having a resilient economy and financial sector that is stable, which I have discussed previously, is only a necessary condition for avoiding crisis.", "But, it is not sufficient to ensure non-occurrence of crisis.", "This is because the key pressure points that can lead to difficulties for us can be externally-induced, especially through capital account developments.", "We all know that sudden changes in global financial conditions and risk-appetite of investors can create difficulties through spillovers.", "Mindful of this, ASEAN needs to come up with cooperation strategy that best fit ASEAN objectives.", "Here, I wish to raise two key areas on regional cooperation strategy for your further exploration.", "First, the new global crisis should hasten ASEAN to think more deeply about the effectiveness of regional surveillance that can detect weakness early on.", "Waiting for the global community through international financial institutions (IFIs) for regional surveillance may be too little too late for timely policy measures that can safeguard the region from contagion from other parts of the world.", "While IFIs will remain useful for surveillance and financing balance of payments need when necessary, regional surveillance capacity must be enhanced more quickly.", "This is one important area where central bank cooperation can be strengthened.", "Indeed, it is very important for policymakers in ASEAN with common challenges to put greater efforts in regional cooperation on maintaining financial stability.", "Having close consultations and sharing experience can usefully avoid potential policy missteps and create policy synergies that eventually foster confidence of investors and other economic agents within and outside ASEAN.", "Second, we have to consider making regional liquidity pool sufficient and effective enough in size and automaticity of disbursement in time of need.", "In the past, stakeholders outside ASEAN have been more concerned about moral hazard problem than the real benefits of regional liquidity pool in time of actual need.", "The present global situation has reconfirmed the vision set forth by the ASEAN Swap Agreement (ASA) and Chiangmai Initiative (CMI) that Asia needs to have its own liquidity pool to protect itself from contagion, be it caused within the region or from outside.", "On the whole, the current financial episode has taught us that, to restore confidence to the public, the authorities' action must be decisive and timely.", "Coordination and cooperation among ASEAN countries must be further enhanced to ensure that prompt remedial actions can be put in place should a crisis occur.", "Ladies and
