liquidity into financial markets.", "The second is to make a commitment to maintain such an accommodative policy stance until the Consumer Price Index registers a year on year increase of zero percent or above on a sustainable basis.", "The fundamental aim of this point is to lower long-term interest rates across the board by borrowing future monetary easing through the commitment.", "Furthermore,
