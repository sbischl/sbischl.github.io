but within RBI.", "What is the outlook for the next 20 years?", "Prospects for next 20 years, in our view, are bright for all the reasons and the record of performance that I have given.", "Yet, there are several challenges that are to be met in the medium term, as articulated in the recent Annual Report of RBI, which reflects the views of eminent Directors on its Board.", "Permit me to list these challenges briefly.", "These are growth of agriculture sector, improvement in physical infrastructure, fiscal empowerment to enhance coverage and quality of education and health, improvement in governance and further reforms in financial and external sector.", "The financial sector reforms are aimed at further development of financial markets, especially bond market, enhancing integration of these markets and further improvement in the banking sector.", "In particular, determined emphasis on financial inclusion, financial literacy and credit counselling is appropriate and, therefore, should continue.", "In the external sector, the approach is towards fuller capital account convertibility, with focus on the enabling conditions for minimizing the risks and maximizing the benefits.", "Are we reasonably confident that we can meet the challenges and maintain the present growth momentum with stability?", "There are grounds for optimism and these include democratic values, financial system stability, skilled manpower, technological capabilities, demographic dividends, large and growing entrepreneurial class, and penchant for innovation.", "The single most critical determining factor for the future would, by all accounts, be the improvements in governance that impacts personal security, property rights, business environment, and above all, a sense of fairness in the conduct of public policy.", "Before concluding, I would like to recall that many distinguished Indians benefited from education at the LSE.", "The most prominent, of course, are Dr. B.R.", "Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution and an eminent economist, and Mr. K.R.", "Narayanan, a reputed diplomat and former President of India.", "In a way, India might have, perhaps, repaid its debt through Dr. I.G.", "Patel, who steered the LSE, as its Director, during a critical period.", "Now, India and LSE are entering a period of productive partnership, in which RBI is privileged to play an active role.", "Let me thank all those assembled here for participating in the launch of the India Observatory in the LSE."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["growth", "financial stability", "inflation", "RBI", "India", "governance", "financial inclusion", "challenges", "external sector", "education"]}
