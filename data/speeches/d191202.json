currently at exceptionally low levels - the possibility of a reassessment of risk premia and a greater differentiation among sovereigns is higher.", "This means that portfolio diversification in terms of issuers and a reduction in the correlation of their specific risk profiles are desirable.", "This imperative is ever greater as the portfolio adjustment is more easily absorbed by the market without affecting the issuers.", "On the other hand, portfolio diversification allows possible regulatory developments to be anticipated.", "This is also an issue of undeniable interest not only to the sovereign, but also to the Portuguese financial system considering the incomplete Banking Union in which the doom loop remains.", "In banks have to be prepared for a situation in which capital markets have a greater importance in financing the real economy.", "This means (i) that for an identical raising of funds, banks will have a different asset composition and (ii) that the raising of funds will be subject to competition from non-bank financial institutions and non-financial issuers of debt and investment instruments.", "In this context it is noteworthy that at European level the non-banking financial sector has significantly expanded its role in financing the real economy, corresponding to 55% of the total financial sector in the euro area.", "Total non-banks' assets have almost doubled over the last 10 years in the euro area.", "In comparison, the size of the banking sector stagnated over this period.", "The most recent impetus to deepen the Capital Markets Union is in line with greater integration of the European financial markets , which brings new challenges and opportunities where promoting sustainable finance gains prominence.", "Attracting savings and financing through the capital markets, as an alternative to the traditional banking sector, will bring about an increase in shared private risk on a cross-border basis, simultaneously creating competitive pressures that will reveal an excess of installed capacity, generating movements towards consolidation as a response to the need for greater scale and efficiency.", "In sixth place, banks, just like any other incumbent financial institutions, will face competition from new entities based on digital transactional platforms and models that will challenge them from a technological and market share point of view.", "This has made the need for investment and absorption of new technologies more urgent in terms of both the processes and the relationship with the market (so-called digital banking).", "In this context, the banking system needs to adopt a proactive stance, assessing the competitiveness and viability of its business model(s) in a timely way, in view of the different segments and products.", "In seventh place, an approach is needed that assimilates and anticipates, whenever possible, the regulatory dynamic making the observance of the supervisory rules - compliance with capital and liquidity ratios, stress tests etc.", "- a competitive advantage generating confidence in the market.", "In eighth place, it is essential to ensure the confidence of the capital markets and the public in general.", "Such confidence is dependent on the elimination of uncertainties as to the nature and valorisation of assets as well as business models and strategies, moving from an approach of limited transparency to one of transparency adjusted to the information requirements, in terms of content and form, for each stakeholder.", "Allow me to elaborate on this latter aspect.", "Regarding institutions' governance, to avoid the materialisation of events that may jeopardise their financial soundness, it must be ensured that the four lines of defence are fully operational and focused on the sustainability of the institution and the safeguard of public confidence in its activity.", "Thus, the Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring sound and prudent management as well as anticipating and adapting the business model based on developments in the business environment.", "Namely, it is responsible for interpreting shareholders' appetite for risk, both in terms of capital requirements and risk taking and acting with diligence, neutrality and conscientious respect for the interests of the depositors, investors, creditors and customers in general, whilst retaining the principle of risk-sharing and the safety of the funds entrusted to it.", "The supervisory bodies and control functions are responsible for rigorously and substantially overseeing the remits conceded by law.", "Particular regard should be given to the role of the supervisory body for the relevance and coverage of the competences attributed to it by law, including overseeing the management body of the undertaking; verifying the precision of the reporting documents and correct assessment of its assets and results; and overseeing the effectiveness of, inter alia, its risk management, internal control and internal audit systems.", "The internal control mechanisms (compliance, risk management control and internal audit) are also essential, especially to guarantee suitable control of risks incurred in banking activity.", "The external auditor is responsible for exhaustively certifying the veracity and completeness of the information, namely the risks that the institution incurs and the costs for the different stakeholders.", "For the duties of independence, integrity and objectivity attributed to it by law, as well as the public interest duties that such a function covers, the external auditor is the element that has the greatest influence on the external credibility of the financial statements, to which, naturally, the legal certification of the accounts contributes.", "Finally, it is the supervisor's responsibility, as I said when I took office in 2010, \"to apply the principle of systematic doubt [...] to carry out a role that is countercyclical\".", "This implies a \"check [...] on the soundness of its fundamentals, its future risks and the way these are recorded on the supervised institution's balance sheet\" .", "This demands the adoption of a perspective that is sceptical, intrusive and proactive, not only in verifying the veracity of the information and its compliance with the regulatory framework, but also in monitoring the sustainability of the institution vis-a\u0300-vis the risk taken and its ability to absorb that risk.", "The supervisor is also responsible for demanding a capital enhancement to address the business model/risks incurred and the risks of the economy (stress testing).", "Considering the need to permanently reinforce the mechanisms designed to prevent or mitigate risks to financial system stability, Banco de Portugal is due to launch a public consultation into a Notice that will repeal and replace Notice No 5/2008 relating to internal control, in light of the developments in European and Portuguese legislation, the guidelines of the European Banking Authority, international best practice, reflection and practical supervisory experience accumulated by Banco de Portugal, as well as for reasons of legal certainty and security.", "This consultation will take place in a context in which, in the significant institutions supervised by the Single Supervisory Mechanism as a whole, there remains a significant number of opportunities for improvement at internal governance, risk management, data aggregation, reporting and internal audit.", "Being undoubtedly a common aim, I hope that you are able to participate actively in this consultation, contributing with your experience to the final design of a fundamental instrument in the defence of financial stability.", "Banco de Portugal (2019), Se\u0301ries Longas -
