fund LTCM in 1998.", "For a period during the crisis, there were substantial problems in the private bond market in the US.", "Financial institutions increased lending and prevented a more extensive credit crunch.", "Conversely, we have seen that when there have been problems in the banking sector, securities markets have replaced bank loans.", "Changes are now taking place, which I think will
