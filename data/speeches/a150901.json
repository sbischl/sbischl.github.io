rising disposable incomes and lower long-term interest rates; \u2022 demographic - population growth, driven in part by migration, and shifts in age structure and family size; \u2022 credit conditions - broader access to and more efficient funding of mortgage credit due to financial liberalization and innovation; and \u2022 other factors - improvements to the macro-policy framework, international investment, preference shifts and regulatory and tax changes.", "House prices and income First, let's look at house prices and income.", "Since 1995, house prices in Canada and the set of comparable countries have increased faster than nominal personal disposable income (Chart 2a).", "During this period, all of these countries experienced solid income growth, with the strongest growth in Norway and Sweden (Chart 2b).", "During the global financial crisis, these countries also experienced house price corrections.", "This caused the ratios of house prices to income to decline temporarily, after which they continued climbing.", "So why did house prices rise faster than income?", "There are a number of possible explanations.", "Chart 3a shows population growth rates in our set of comparable countries over two periods, 1975 to 1994 and 1995 to 2015.", "Population growth rates were the highest in Australia, Canada and New Zealand over the entire sample.", "Moreover, growth rates increased in all countries, except Canada, in the post-1995 period relative to the pre-1995 period.", "Therefore, population growth could help explain the rise in house prices relative to income for most countries over the latter part of the sample.", "One of the factors that has affected population growth rates is migration.", "Net migration was highest in Australia and Canada over the entire sample.", "In addition, net migration increased importantly in all five countries in the second half of the sample period (Chart 3b).", "In Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the rate of population growth of the approximate house-owning cohort of those aged 25 to 75 declined in the second part of the sample period.", "This likely reflects the aging of their populations as the postwar baby boom generation moved from youth into middle age (Chart 4).", "Nonetheless, the growth rate of this cohort still remains well above 1 per cent for these three countries.", "In Canada, it is noteworthy that the average family size decreased from about 3.5 in 1976 to below 3.0 in 2011, a decline of approximately 20 per cent.", "Partial evidence suggests that this pattern is similar in the other advanced economies in our sample.", "This decline in the average family size has supported the rate of household formation, and thus, has partially offset the impact of the lower growth rate of the house-owning cohort on the demand for houses in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.", "It is also important to consider where population growth is occurring.", "Chart 5 shows that over our sample period, the pace of urbanization, measured by the change in the urbanization ratio, has increased since 1995 in all of the countries in the comparable group, except New Zealand.", "Australia and Canada are notable for the size of the shift, which could be explained by a number of factors.", "These include the well-known agglomeration economies of scale provided by urban areas and the location preferences of home-owners, especially younger-age cohorts and recent immigrants.", "The urbanization of the population in Norway also stands out.", "This could potentially explain why house prices have grown faster in Norway than in Canada, even though population growth in Canada has been higher than in Norway.", "To sum up, population growth and the shift in demand for housing toward urban areas have exerted strong upward pressure on house prices.", "Credit conditions A third demand factor affecting house prices is the improvement in mortgage credit conditions.", "Lower long-term interest rates and financial liberalization and innovation have improved housing affordability in advanced economies, especially since the mid-1990s.", "I'll say a few words about each of these changes that have influenced the availability of credit.", "Since 2000, real 10-year government bond yields have trended downward across all advanced countries, including those in our comparison group, with a slight increase during the recent financial crisis (Chart 6).", "The decline in yields has been attributed to higher global savings and stronger monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, which have credibly reduced inflation and risk premiums by increasing macroeconomic stability in the roughly 15-year period (known as the Great Moderation) that preceded the global financial crisis.", "Since the crisis, persistently weak global demand - especially real investment - coupled with sustained low central bank policy rates and large asset purchases has helped to lower long-term interest rates and, in turn, reduce financing costs for financial intermediaries and mortgage rates for households.", "Other things being equal, this decline has helped improve the affordability of home ownership and support demand for houses.", "\"Fifty years of families in Canada: 1961 to 2011,\" Statistics Canada.", "In Canada, the evidence indicates that much of the increase in home ownership is among the older cohort of the population, which suggests that longer and healthier life spans may have supported house demand in recent years.", "New Zealand is the most urbanized country in the sample; its ratio was already above 80 per cent in 1975.", "See, for example, Agglomeration Economics, edited by Edward L.

\u2022 sustainable fiscal positions; and \u2022 effective financial regulatory and supervisory frameworks.", "As a result, these countries achieved a high degree of macro and financial stability over the post-1995 period;

investment and possible preference shifts.", "Third, in terms of supply, the constraints imposed by geography and regulation have decreased housing supply elasticity, especially in urban areas.", "This reduced supply elasticity has interacted with demand shifts toward more urbanization to push up house prices in major cities.", "Fourth, the credible and effective macro and financial policy frameworks in place in Canada and the other countries considered here have contributed to a high degree of macroeconomic and financial stability.", "Consequently, in the face of a protracted global recovery, their countercyclical policies successfully underpinned domestic demand in the post-crisis period.", "The resulting strength in the housing market has increased household imbalances, but the
