right things.", "While entrepreneurship starts by putting himself before business and questions that are at the forefront is \"What do I want to do?\"", "or \"What is my role?\"", ", but when it succeeds the right questions to ask is \"What does the business need?\"", "and \"Do I have these qualities?\"", "As successful entrepreneurs, having gained experience and wisdom from past mistakes,

credit linkage to the people who are trained by the RSETIs.", "The banks have also been advised the SLBC convenor banks, in consultation with State Governments, to formulate a scheme for utilising specified NGOs for providing training and other services to tiny micro enterprises, To leverage bank credit for inclusive growth bank's have been advised to develop linkages with such NGOs / Corporate
