everything went haywire after March...", "Yes, we have since had an increase in inflation but this is largely attributable to the delayed higher international energy prices and the spike in food and cereal prices.", "We have been importing inflation, and the way we have administered prices in the energy sector has not helped.", "We have tried to protect ourselves for too long from market prices, and then when you make changes they tend to be bigger than if you had allowed the gradual movement of prices to take place.", "To what extent has the introduction of the euro helped to cushion the impact of the financial crisis?", "Where would we be with the Maltese lira?", "I was one of those who always expressed the belief that Malta's small open economy in a liberalised global environment

ever be returned?", "The experience of other countries suggests there is always a considerable proportion of currency issued which is never returned.", "It depends on how long the currency has been in circulation.", "Many coins which were issued up to 30 years ago have probably left the country through tourism or have been lost.", "It is the same with notes, especially the small denomination notes - they might have been lost or deteriorated.", "Some of the higher denomination notes might still be hidden away, and maybe forgotten.", "Has the euro hoarding started?", "I do not suppose all those who had that habit have adopted a new way of doing things.", "In 2007 there was considerable activity with people exchanging Maltese lira notes for euro on the kerb market - and that probably represented mainly hoarded money.", "We had people who were hoarding money because of habit - these were persuaded to open bank accounts.", "Last year we saw a sharp increase in bank deposits when the banks targeted these people with very attractive interest rates on short-term deposits to take them over the end of the year to save them the trouble of having to exchange cash.", "What we know is that we have not reached the same level of currency issued that we had before.", "There is a caveat here as the currency is shared with 14 other countries.", "Do you believe that the international financial crisis is prompting more people to become reluctant about depositing their money into banks?", "Across the Eurosystem, in September, after the Lehman Brothers collapse there was an increased
