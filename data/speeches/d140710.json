\uf0b7 In the longer run, ageing and slower innovation may push up saving rates and bring down the return on capital.", "Therefore, the ultimate response to the risk of secular stagnation is to improve the return on investment, thus pushing the natural interest rate back into positive territory.", "Again, this is not only a European problem.", "But we do have difficulties in this regard.", "Structural reforms are not easy.", "Many, however, are currently being implemented.", "France, although at too slow a pace, is reducing taxes on labour and has somewhat improved labour market flexibility.", "Adjustments efforts conducted by several countries, especially in Southern Europe, are starting to pay off.", "Competitiveness gaps between Northern and Southern Member States have been reduced, notably through real wages decreases in countries like Spain or Portugal, which are exporting more and more.", "This builds the way for a healthy growth in peripheral countries, which are experiencing a trade surplus of 2% of their GDP on average, and a moderate public deficit, taken down to 3%.", "Short-term policy challenges and responses The main challenge, of course, is low and declining inflation, with inflation expectations in the euro area drifting downward at short to medium-term horizons.", "This prevents adjustments in relative prices, - an important mechanism to eliminate gaps in competitiveness - and increases the risk of outright deflation, should a negative shock occur in the future.", "Strangely, in the euro area, growth and inflation are moving in opposite directions.", "As growth accelerates, inflation keeps going down.", "This \"disconnect\" in the Philips curve is puzzling.", "We must look, then, at the broader picture.", "Euro area economies have attracted strong capital inflows over the recent months, with two opposite effects on financial conditions: first, easing through lower long-term interest rates.", "And, second, an appreciation of the euro exchange rate.", "It's not clear whether the overall effect is positive.", "While nominal conditions are more accommodating in euro area than in the US, real indicators point to a more restrictive stance.", "We may see a perverse feedback loop develop, with low inflation, increasing real rates, capital inflows and exchange rate appreciation mutually fuelling each other.", "The financial economy may be heading towards a bad equilibrium that would threaten the real economic recovery.", "The situation called for an appropriate policy response and, as you know, the Governing Council has agreed last month on a strong package of four significant measures.", "First the refinancing and deposit rates have both been reduced - bringing the deposit rate into negative territory for the first time.", "Second, the ordinary regime of unlimited liquidity provision has been extended to the end of 2016.", "Third, the Eurosystem will conduct a new set of targeted longer-term refinancing operations.", "This exceptional liquidity will be provided at long maturity (up to four years) and a guaranteed fixed rate, a clear sign that monetary accommodation should persist for a very long time.", "Finally, the Eurosystem is actively preparing to buy asset based securities that will help channel monetary accommodation and ease financial conditions to private non financial borrowers, especially SMEs.", "New communication strategy As you know, two important decisions were made at the last Governing Council: the frequency of monetary policy meetings will change to a six-week cycle;
