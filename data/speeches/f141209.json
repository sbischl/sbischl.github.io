apparent inability to generate economic growth, even in the longer term.", "Up until then, the illusion had prevailed that the Eurosystem could conduct monetary policy simply treating the euro area as

recall two of those expressions of doubt: Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa's \"currency without a State\"17 and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's \"limp\".", "Ciampi observed that \"at the very moment the euro was

transmission between countries and undermining the central bank's functional independence.", "This for three principal reasons.", "First, the sovereign debt crisis stirred fears that the euro could break up.", "An eventuality that until then had been judged to be of probability zero now, in international eyes, entered the sphere of possibility.", "The consequence, which materialized mostly in 2011, was investors' demand for high premiums on government bonds in the countries of southern Europe.", "The lack of fiscal union thus came to the fore, and the policy limp could be seen in all its destabilizing potential.", "Second, this resulted in an accentuated segmentation of the European financial market along national lines, marking a brusque regression in the laborious process of integration that had been advancing for a decade-and-a-half.", "The flows of capital between the North and the South of what should be a single currency area were interrupted.", "Third, all of this

fears as their \"sovereigns\".", "Everyone knows that banks everywhere tend to have a larger portion of their assets in their home country's government securities.", "At the origin of the risks investors suddenly perceived there were also, in the countries under pressure, serious disequilibria that had built up well before the global financial crisis.", "These weaknesses, varying in extent from country to country, comprised excessive public or private debt, poor competitiveness, dubious prospects for economic growth, and external imbalances.", "The single currency had shrouded the

essentially systemic nature of the problems that have struck the entire area.", "What could the ECB do?", "In May 2010 it activated the Securities Market Programme for purchases of public- and private-sector securities on the secondary market; the purchases were extended to Italian and Spanish securities in the summer of 2011.", "In December of that year two longer-term refinancing operations were announced, with the aim of countering the effects that the strains on government securities and capital outflows were having on the wholesale funding of banks in several euro-area countries.", "In August 2012, amidst resurgent fears of euro reversibility, the ECB announced that it stood ready to carry out outright monetary transactions: secondary-market purchases of government securities issued by countries that agreed to abide by a European programme of financial assistance.", "To date, no such purchases have been made, nor have the related acts been formally adopted, pending a ruling by the European Court of Justice on the German Constitutional Court's referral.", "But their announcement alone was enough to calm the markets.", "The effectiveness of these measures must not be underestimated.", "They lessened the tensions in the money and capital markets and averted a sharper contraction in credit, thereby braking the deterioration of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.", "According to studies by the Bank of Italy, the overall effect on Italy's GDP of the measures I have listed can be estimated at a little less than three percentage points in the two years 2012-13.21 These measures also highlighted the operational autonomy of the Eurosystem, which was able to bring a wide array of instruments to bear on the different manifestations of the financial crisis, selecting the most suitable one case by case.", "However, the success of the ECB's extraordinary measures must not make us forget the difficulties that monetary policy in the euro area has faced in recent years.", "The global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis have brought risks for the Eurosystem's de facto independence that it would be nai\u0308ve to ignore or underestimate.", "I will mention two of them.", "The first concerns financial autonomy and derives from the fact that the unconventional measures have expanded the size of the ECB's balance sheet, though far less, at present, than those of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.", "The quality of the securities held or accepted as collateral for bank refinancing has declined.", "In principle, monetary measures of macroeconomic stabilization can produce both losses and profits for the central bank adopting them.", "But if a central bank made losses, its reputation would be endangered23 and its ability to pursue its objectives could be put in doubt; ultimately, there could be mounting political pressure to reduce its independence.", "This is especially true in the case of the Eurosystem, which not only manages a currency without a state but finds itself facing a multiplicity of states which in these years of crisis have become more sensitive to what divides them rather than strengthening what unites them.", "The second, and far more important, risk consists precisely in the incompleteness of the European construction.", "Some are calling for amendments to the Treaty in order to expand the ECB's mandate.", "In particular, on the American example, it is urged that the objective of price stability be flanked by an explicit objective of equal status in terms of unemployment or employment levels; and that the ECB be allowed to purchase government securities directly at issue.", "Naturally it's not up to me, a central banker, to say what objectives the political institutions should assign to the central bank.", "But these risk being false solutions to a false problem.", "Maintaining a moderate rate of growth in prices in the medium term like that indicated in the ECB's objective equates to ensuring over the same time horizon that the economy operates at its potential, with physical and human capital fully utilized.", "Assigning the ECB a dual mandate would not imply any step forward.", "As for government securities purchases on the primary market, in reality this power, which can put the independence of any central bank in jeopardy, is
