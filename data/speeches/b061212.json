thought at first.", "National Accounts data indicate a 1.4 percent decline (in annual terms) in GDP in the third quarter.", "The impact of the hostilities on GDP was weaker than we had assessed previously, and it appears that the rate of growth in 2006 will be 4.8 percent, slightly higher than our initial post-war forecast.", "Our forecast for 2007 still indicates healthy growth of 4
