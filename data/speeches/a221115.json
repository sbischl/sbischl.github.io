such as deglobalisation or a more costly energy mix - which have permanently lowered potential output.", "In these circumstances, the economy could be overheating even though real GDP remains well below its pre-pandemic path (Chart 7).", "In other words, by lowering potential output the supply shocks could have created excess demand and hence a positive output gap, which would justify a more restrictive policy stance.", "Euro area real GDP (index 2014 = 100) Sources: ECB staff macroeconomic projections and calculations.", "Distinguishing between these two possible explanations in real time is no easy task.", "Just as for the origins of the shocks, it requires a close look at the evidence.", "One way of doing this is by looking at output gap estimates.", "Estimates from major forecasting institutions show some dispersion, but point in a similar direction: they all foresee a negative output gap in 2023 that does not fully close in 2024 (Chart 8).", "[ With regard to the current situation, estimating revisions of potential output in real time is tricky[ but the latest European Commission estimates foresee potential growth at 1.2% in 2023 and 1.3 % in 2024, with the level of potential output in 2024 being 5.6% higher than in 2019.", "Euro area output gap Measures of the euro area output gap across a suite of models (percentage of potential output) Sources: European Commission's Autumn 2022 European Economic Forecast, OECD's June 2022 Economic Outlook and IMF's November 2022 World Economic Outlook.", "Quarterly estimates are interpolated from annual data.", "An alternative way of analysing whether supply capacity has fallen is to examine the possible effects of individual adverse supply shocks.", "ECB staff recently conducted a series of studies which suggest that shocks analogous to those seen in recent months are likely to have limited effects on potential.", "The studies found that even significant hypothetical negative shocks such as deglobalisation[ - and the associated global supply chain disruptions - or a permanent and large increase in oil prices[ would induce only a moderate downward revision in the level of potential output in the euro area after four years, ranging from -0.3% in the first case to -0.8% in the second compared to the baseline scenario without these shocks.", "[ These effects need to be set against a projected cumulative increase in potential output of around 5% over the same period, as estimated by the European Commission.", "Similarly, analyses focusing on the euro area labour market suggest that the shocks we have seen in recent years -

without clear evidence that this is the case - could prove self-fulfilling and costly.", "The evidence increasingly shows that destroying demand also affects supply.", "Research on recessions over the last fifty years has found that deep contractions - including those driven by monetary policy - lead to long-lasting effects on real GDP compared to the pre-contraction trend.", "[ This suggests that current macroeconomic policies should be designed to avoid unnecessarily heightening the risk that the increasingly likely contraction in coming months becomes a severe and protracted one, which would scar the economy.", "This requires that energy and fiscal policies remain targeted and contribute to dampen inflationary pressures, helping to keep inflation expectations anchored while preserving productive capacity.", "But it also requires that monetary policy does not ignore the risks of overtightening.", "[ If we were to compress demand in an excessive and persistent manner, we would face the risk of also pushing output permanently below trend, irrespective of whether the initial shocks were temporary or not (that is, even if a harsh policy reaction was unnecessary).", "And that could not be easily reversed by subsequent policy easing, not least because expansions do not rebuild supply nearly as much as contractions destroy it.", "[ Second, even if we were to conclude that supply shocks will lower potential durably, we would still need to examine their effects on demand before deciding our policy stance.", "[ For instance, workers may accept some loss in real income as demand softens, costs can no longer be passed on easily to consumers and risks to job security increase.", "In some euro area countries, wage negotiations focus on core inflation rather than headline inflation.", "This can be seen as a recognition that the terms of trade loss has to be borne - at least to some extent - rather than retrieved.", "Also, in this setting, households may choose to reduce consumption - instead of smoothing it and mitigating the hit to spending - because a permanently lower potential output would also permanently reduce their future income and wealth.", "Recent research using endogenous growth models shows that, if supply shocks cause \"scarring\", the prospect of lower potential output reduces investment and productivity growth.", "By compressing households' future income and their current spending, it can cause demand to drop by as much as - or even more than - supply.", "[ All told, these effects imply that, even in the face of lasting consequences of supply shocks on potential output, the implications for the output gap, inflation dynamics and optimal policy calibration can only be derived over time.", "And this reinforces the case that, for as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, monetary policy should adjust but not overreact.", "[ ECB staff projections published in September 2022, which foresee inflation close to 2% at the end of their horizon, are consistent with a withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.", "But the uncertainty surrounding supply and demand dynamics requires us to remain prudent as regards how far the adjustment needs to go.", "And we should not ignore the fact that the tightening, which has followed from our decisions since the end of 2021 and from expectations of further adjustments in our stance, is already working its way through the economy -
