A good credit information system contributes to financial stability.", "Armed with consolidated records in the credit information system, regulators are better equipped to assess the indebtedness of all individuals in the country.", "This enables regulators to be in a position to determine whether or not the financial stability of the country is under threat and whether or not necessary action needs to be undertaken to contain the situation.", "The second issue, I would like to talk about today is whether or not credit bureau are illegal in Namibia.", "This issue has been a subject of speculation in the media recently.", "The Bank of Namibia's view is that the existing credit bureaus in Namibia are legal entities registered in accordance with the relevant laws by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.", "That means they are not illegal.", "What is missing in our legal system at the moment is a specific law regulating how these entities should manage the information under their care.", "This will be my next point, the third issue I would like to talk about.", "How should Credit Bureau be regulated going forward?", "Ladies and Gentlemen, as required in the NFSS I cited earlier, the Bank of Namibia conducted a study on the organisation of credit bureaus in Namibia.", "The study recommended that credit bureau be regulated through a specific regulations of credit bureaus.", "To this end, the Bank of Namibia has commenced the process of drafting the Credit Bureau Regulations.", "We believe these regulations will be in force before the end of the year.", "In few days, the draft regulation will be available for public scrutiny and comments.", "We invite all stakeholders to present their input to Bank of Namibia in this regard.", "The regulation of credit bureaus through Regulations is an interim arrangement pending the finalization of the comprehensive Consumer Credit legislation, which is envisaged to be in place in the medium term.", "In conclusion, let me once again commend FinMark Trust for organizing this important workshop and we keenly await the outcome.", "I look forward to a day when Namibia will be rated as one of the countries with the best credit information system in the world, where a credit score can be produced in five minutes.", "I believe this is possible if we all work together and we owe this to the future of our children.", "Thank you for your kind attention."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Credit Information", "Financial Inclusion", "Credit Bureaus", "Credit Information System", "Financial Stability", "Consumer Credit", "Creditworthiness", "Credit Assessment", "Credit Score", "Credit Registry"]}
