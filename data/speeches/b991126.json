under such conditions - provide no stimulus to the economy.", "Second, as one of the classical functions of a central bank is to extend emergency liquidity assistance, central banks need adequate information not only on financial markets in general but also on individual institutions.", "As monetary stability might be affected when a big player gets into difficulties, central banks should be in a position to form a view if a certain institution is illiquid or insolvent, and if the latter is the case, whether this institution is of systemic importance or not.", "An additional challenge here is that institutions outside the supervisory umbrella -
