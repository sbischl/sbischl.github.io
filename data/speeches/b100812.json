been recovering more rapidly than expected owing to the fact that international policy cooperation has been swiftly brought to bear against the global financial crisis.", "A great contribution to this

financial stability, this is not seen as conflicting with price stability.", "Considering that financial system unrest generally means that the transmission channels of monetary policy are not working as they should, financial stability is a precondition for a price stability.", "The central bank's expansion of liquidity supply in order to contain the crisis is also consistent with price stability

structural adjustment has been delayed in the course of the response to the global financial crisis.", "Instead of the number of firms in default shrinking, there was a big increase in the number of firms with an interest coverage ratio less than unity owing to the promotion of various emergency support measures including the government's fast track support for SMEs and increased credit guarantee ceilings.", "Since the Korean economy has largely shaken off the influence of the global financial crisis, the drive for the restructuring of firms should in future be carried out in a normal manner at their own initiative based on the market mechanism.", "Systematic improvement efforts should be redoubled so that the market mechanism can work properly by reducing the barriers to new entry and exit for firms.", "Government support should be limited to start-ups that have just entered the market so as to block the continued existence of firms that are dependent upon rent-seeking behavior.",

quantitative expansion of capital owing to restrictions on further inputs of labor.", "Growth is then led by the enhancement of productivity based on technological advances.", "For fresh growth

to be breaking free from the influence of the financial crisis.", "Consequently countries around the world are now seeking exit strategies for the unconventional policy tools that were mobilized in
