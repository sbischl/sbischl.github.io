significant institutional reforms have been initiated aiming at providing banks with a variety of means of reducing non-performing loans.", "According to incoming data, there has been progress since the beginning of the year in the area of banks' At end-June 2017, the stock of NPEs (including off Non Performing Exposures (NPE).", "The short and medium-term outlook of the Greek economy The economic recovery continues and growth is gathering pace following the completion of the second review and the positive impact it had on confidence and liquidity.", "The consolidation of growth dynamics is reflected not only in GDP figures, but also in the performance of several short-term indicators of economic activity, such as: industrial production, retail sales, dependent employment flows in the private sector, and real exports of goods, tourist arrivals and receipts.", "The improved outlook for the economy boosted economic sentiment, increased bank deposits, improved Greece's credit rating and led to successive declines in the banks' dependence on central bank financing: for example, Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greek banks now stands at \u20ac26.9 billion, down from its peak of \u20ac90 billion in July 2015.", "In addition, yields of Greek government bonds declined to late-2009 levels, which allowed the Greek government to return to international

risk is a delay in the completion of the third review of the which will fuel a new cycle of uncertainty.", "In such a case economic recovery and the return to international financial markets will prove to be short-lived.", "In addition, there are external risks associated with developments in global financial markets and geopolitical factors.", "There are also some medium-term challenges that need to be addressed in order to strengthen the positive outlook.", "In particular: The currently high and persistent long-term unemployment raises inequality, posing a risk for social cohesion and

sufficient credit to the private sector.", "Investment remains at a very low level, due also to the fact that, despite considerable progress, the business environment is not yet considered as friendly as it should be towards private investment.", "For example, according to the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum, competitiveness slightly deteriorated in 2017-2018.", "According to this Index, the most problematic factors for doing business in Greece are considered to be high tax rates, inefficient government bureaucracy, tax regulations, policy and government instability, access to finance and corruption.", "The general government debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to unsustainable levels.", "Preconditions for a sustainable recovery To address the existing risks and challenges and to remain on a sustainable recovery path, economic policy must focus on the following eight issues: i.", "Attract FDI and increase openness As already mentioned, the economic adjustment and the structural improvements in Greece during the past seven years have been one of the largest ever undertaken by any country.", "Among other benefits, this has minimized the various risks, has rendered Greece more business friendly and created significant investment opportunities.", "However, domestic savings are insufficient to meet investment needs which, after a long period of very low investment rates, are significant even though capacity utilization remains low in some sectors.", "Thus, besides restoring access of companies to capital markets and to bank funding, conditions should be encouraged that will attract foreign capital, notably Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).", "FDI, besides closing the investment gap, promotes greater trade ties with countries and companies with cutting edge-technologies.", "This facilitates the participation in global value chains (GVCs).", "FDI and participation in GVC improve both physical and human capital, spur innovation and contribute to the development of new products and services in high value added sectors, thus boosting productivity.", "Domestic and foreign investment and the integration in GVC will increase openness and improve both the quantity and quality of Greek exports.", "This, in turn, will accelerate the reallocation of productive resources towards exports and will raise the long-term potential output.", "At the same time, the production of high technology goods and the provision of high technology knowledgeintensive services will improve the capacity of the country to retain and attract talents.", "Pursue privatizations, reforms and improve institutions Despite the progress achieved so far, there is still a lot to be done in the areas of structural reforms and the quality of institutions.", "Privatizations, which are at a mature stage, need to be completed quickly.", "In order to attract both domestic and foreign investment, further emphasis should be put on reforms that foster competition in product and services markets, which in turn raises productivity and employment.", "At this point I want to emphasize that well-functioning institutions matter for economic growth and enable countries to address significant challenges, because they affect incentives for people and businesses to invest in physical and human capital, technology and the organization of production.", "As pointed out in the seminal work of Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), institutions can increase both aggregate economic growth and improveincome distribution, because they guarantee property rights and enforce contract law, providing incentives for people and businesses to invest and innovate, while at the same time the State provides adequate education and a sufficient level and quality of public infrastructure, allowing people and businesses to thrive.", "Hence, good institutions enable growth and poverty reduction.", "At the same time economic and social progress also facilitates better institutions.", "Well-functioning institutions improve non-price competitiveness, enhance business confidence and reduce the country risk, leading to more domestic and foreign investment.", "Therefore, besides macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment, more economic flexibility via the adoption of structural reforms and sound institutions lead to more resilience, faster recovery after an adverse shock and higher long-term growth.", "Institutions have improved in a number of cases over the course of the years.", "For example, the independence of the Hellenic Statistical Authority (EL.STAT) and the new Tax Revenue Authority has been established by law.", "In addition, over the course of the crisis, new institutions and regulatory authorities have been established.", "For example, the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Fiscal Council improves oversight on public finances.", "However, much more needs to be done in a number of areas.", "According to the Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018 of the World Economic Forum, Greece ranks in the 87th position out of 137 countries in terms of institutions.", "Greece ranks quite low in terms of the efficiency of government spending, the burden of government regulation, and the efficiency of the legal framework in settling disputes and in challenging regulations.", "Moreover, according to the World Bank's \"Ease of Doing Business\" ranking on the conditions for setting up a business, Greece's position has improved significantly in 2011-2017 (from 148 in 2011 to 37 in 2017), but remains low relative to its European peers.", "Therefore, particular emphasis should now be placed on upgrading the education system, improving public administration, cutting red tape, lowering the regulatory burden and ensuring the predictability and stability of legislation, reducing entry barriers into network industries, retail trade and professional services as well as in enhancing judicial efficiency.", "With regard to independent authorities, it is important to strengthen the role and administrative and financial autonomy, as well as accountability towards the Parliament, of the authorities responsible for regulating, supervising and maintaining a level playing field in the markets.", "It should be taken into account that most of the reforms to be implemented entail fewer shortterm costs relative to those implemented earlier on in the programme (i.e.", "labour and pension reforms).", "However, taking into account the synergies with the already implemented reforms, upcoming reforms are expected to yield immediate net gains in terms of faster economic recovery.", "Moreover, flexible economic structures and better institutions not only lead to higher long-term growth but also reduce the probability of severe recessions.", "Tackle the NPL problem In the banking sector, the large volume of non-performing loans and the problem of the strategic defaulters prevent the banking system from financing economic growth.", "All the necessary measures have now been legislated and the regulatory framework has been reformulated in order to be able to address the NPL problem in an efficient and expeditious manner.", "As I mentioned earlier, incoming data point to a reduction in NPEs and this is mainly driven by loan write-offs.", "However, banks should utilize all the available toolbox to reduce troubled assets, and in particular speed up the sale of NPLs.", "To accelerate the reduction of the NPL stock, the new electronic auctions platform should become fully operational as soon as possible.", "Particular emphasis should also be placed on the restructuring of viable companies and the liquidation of non-viable ones.", "This will release resources to support new and existing sound investment and business initiatives, thereby supporting the economic recovery.", "The recent modernisation of the institutional framework allows the co-operation of banks with loan servicers and various non-bank entities and private investors, such as private equity funds, in order to restructure the underlying business.", "Adopt a growth friendly fiscal policy mix The Bank of Greece has proposed the adoption of a more growth friendly fiscal policy mix.", "More emphasis has to be placed on cutting non-productive expenditures and increasing the public sector efficiency, including the management of state property.", "This is important since, according to OECD estimates, state property in Greece is among the highest as a percent of GDP in OECD member-states.", "The scaling down of an oversized and inefficient public sector and the improvement in tax administration will lead to a fairer distribution of the fiscal burden and will facilitate the reduction of the excessively high tax rates.", "According to the Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, Greece ranks last and second to last as regards the adequacy of the tax system to provide incentives to invest (137th out 137 countries) and to work (136th out of 137 countries).", "v. Support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) SMEs are the backbone of the Greek economy in terms of employment and gross value added (GVA).", "In 2015, they accounted for 75.1% of total GVA and for 87.3% of employment in non-financial corporations.", "Very small or micro SMEs (employing less than 10 people) accounted for 59.1% of total employment and for 35.9% of GVA in the non-financial corporate sector.", "The larger share of SMEs in total employment relative to their share in GVA suggests that there is a problem of low productivity, which is more pronounced for very small SMEs.", "Given the prevalence of SMEs in the Greek economy, policy efforts should also be targeted towards providing incentives for cluster development, alongside with measures to provide affordable funding via the banking sector, the capital markets and the official sector through various EU initiatives.", "These concerted efforts will allow SMEs to adopt new technologies and benefit from economies of scale as they will gain access to international distribution channels and to foreign markets.", "Remove various barriers to investment Besides improving the business environment and lowering taxation, it is necessary to remove decisively and definitively the obstacles arising from various small or large organized interests and groups, which exacerbate the business climate and hamper the materialization of new investment and the implementation of privatizations, even those already approved.", "The removal of capital controls as a result of the gradual improvement of the economy and the return of full confidence will improve the investment climate and help attract foreign direct investment.", "Promote innovation and a more effective use of human capital Innovation-driven growth, supported by knowledge-based capital (or intangible assets), is critical to improving living standards.", "The efforts of previous years, mainly through the use of resources from the European Structural Funds, have led to a partial improvement in the country's performance in many areas, with the expenditure in research and development (R&D) being on an upward trend over the period 2011- 2016.", "Despite the continuing rise, Greece records one of the lowest R&D intensities compared to its euro area peers (2.0% of GDP).", "However, innovation-based growth is based on a much wider range of elements than just R&D spending, such as employee skills and training, investment in information and communication technologies (ICT), organizational know-how, databases, design, brands and various forms of intellectual property.", "A more effective use of domestic high-skilled human capital requires the adoption of policies and reforms that encourage research, facilitate the diffusion of technology and boost entrepreneurship.", "Companies should be incentivized to increase investment in R&D in order to improve their capacity to innovate.", "Universities and research institutes should be encouraged to cooperate with the private sector to commercially exploit research results and ideas.", "These initiatives will promote innovation, increase productivity and facilitate the transition to a knowledge-based economy.", "The improvement in institutions and the implementation of the reform and privatization program will provide incentives for the initiation of new investment projects.", "New investment goes hand-inhand with job creation and is, thus, expected to facilitate the reduction of the unacceptably high unemployment rate.", "However, certain aspects of structural reforms and the stabilisation of the economy might have negative distributional effects.", "Hence, it is essential to provide immediate support to the unemployed and those marginally attached to the labour market by employing active labour market policies and targeted social transfers to counter the temporary income loss and to shorten job-transitions.", "In the medium-term, emphasis should be placed on skill upgrading and retraining policies to get people back to work as well as improvements in education, given that investment in human capital is a prerequisite to an inclusive and sustainable growth model.", "Address the public debt overhang Decisive and concrete actions are needed to ensure the sustainability of Greek public debt.", "The Eurogroup reaffirmed last June its commitment to the principles contained in the May 2016 statement, and specific mention was made of measures that could be taken, if necessary, regarding public debt reprofiling.", "The Bank of Greece has put forward a specific proposal for extending the weighted average maturity of interest payments on EFSF loans of at least 8.5 years.", "If adopted, such a proposal would support both the recovery of the economy and the country's creditworthiness.", "This is more so if it is combined with a lower fiscal target, that is a primary surplus of 2.0 percent of GDP instead of 3.5 percent, and more privatisations.", "This mild debt reprofiling proposal is vital for debt sustainability in Greece, while it involves only a negligible cost for its partners.", "It would also pave the way for the inclusion of Greek government bonds in the ECB's quantitative easing programme, which in turn will facilitate sustainable market access, the return of more deposits to the Greek banks and, ultimately, the full abolition of capital controls.", "Greece has the potential to become an attractive investment destination I will now briefly refer to some factors and structural features that make Greece an attractive place to invest.", "First, the policy changes that have taken place over the past seven years, coupled with the decisive implementation of the remaining reforms, improve confidence, enhance business climate and generate positive growth prospects providing incentives for the initiation of new domestic and foreign direct investment.", "Second, The most crucial factor that ensures the economic policy is and will remain prudent.", "implementation of the reforms required for the Greek economy to prosper in the context of the Economic and Monetary Union is the emergence of a strong political consensus in Parliament and society in favour of keeping Greece in the euro area.", "In addition, adherence to the EU macroeconomic and fiscal rules and the strict monitoring by the EU as part of postprogramme surveillance which is already envisaged for programme member-states with relatively high public debt, precludes the emergence of new imbalances.", "Third, Greece benefits from a large amount of EU funds which aim at boosting growth and jobs.", "Fourth, Greece is both a Hence, enterprises European Union and a euro area member state.", "located in Greece enjoy the benefits of currency and price stability and have access to the EU They face a stable institutional environment, enjoy investor protection, and have Single Market.", "access to a sound banking system which is under the oversight of the European Central Bank.", "Fifth, there are several features that make Greece an attractive non-price competitiveness place to invest.", "Greece has a highly skilled human capital by international standards.", "According to the 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum, Greece ranks relatively high in higher education and training (44th out of 137 countries) and, in particular, in the tertiary and the secondary education enrollment rates.", "Moreover, Greece also receives a relatively good ranking in (50nd) and in some technological readiness innovation and business sophistication factors like the application for patents (PCT patents: 37th), and particularly in the availability of scientists and engineers (10th).", "In addition, Greece receives a relatively good ranking in terms of the strength of investor protection (41th) and in terms of its infrastructure (38th) as well as the number of procedures to start a business (36th) and the degree of customer orientation (48th).", "Sixth, one of Greece's most important advantages is its in Southeastern geographical location Europe.", "Being at the crossroads of three continents and in close proximity with the MiddleEast and the Arab world, Greece provides significant investment opportunities as a and energy hub.", "Given that Greece is a major tourist destination country, there are significant investment opportunities in tourism conditional on expanding the capacity and quality of tourism infrastructure.", "Investment opportunities also exist in sectors such as logistics, networks, shipping, trade, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and mining and quarrying.", "Since many Arab countries seek to diversify their investment base, these sectors in Greece provide a mutually beneficial opportunity for doing so.", "Seventh, it has already been mentioned that Greece has a sizeable state real estate property that is available for utilization by private investors under the privatization programme.", "Both the and the private investment needs generate profitable current privatization programme investment opportunities for foreign investors.", "Despite some missteps, there is already encouraging evidence.", "It is the biggest FDI inflow recorded since 2010 and was mainly directed to services sectors (i.e.", "hotels and restaurants, transportation, financial intermediation and real estate activities).", "In the first the total inflow has already reached \u20ac2.7 billion.", "eight months of 2017 The increased FDI flow and the continuation of the privatization programme (e.g.", "the recent sale of the train operator Trainose S.A. to Trenitalia, the extension of the Athens International Airport Development Agreement for 20 additional years) indicate that major foreign investors see positive prospects on the future of the Greek economy.", "Last but not least, Greece, being a member of the EU, NATO and other international multilateral organizations, enjoys peace, security and enhanced cooperation with its partners.", "Conclusions The ongoing reform and fiscal adjustment effort is bearing fruits.", "The fiscal and current account imbalances have now been corrected, important and long-needed reforms have been implemented, competitiveness has improved and the banking sector is adequately capitalized.", "The economy is now recovering and growth is gathering pace.", "However, more needs to be done.", "Greece is now facing three stock imbalances, namely a high rate of unemployment, a high public debt and a high stock of NPLs in bank portfolios.", "These three crisis legacies, coupled with the significant investment requirements in order to improve the economy and modernize its public and private infrastructure, will remain the major challenges for Greece over the coming years.", "In addition, we still have some way to go in order for Greece to tap the financial market on sustainable terms after the end of the current programme in August 2018.", "To this end, the Greek authorities must pursue the remaining reforms forcefully and close the 3rd review before the end of the year, in order to improve the credit rating of the country.", "At the same time our European partners should specify in more detail the medium-term debt reprofiling measures according to the Eurogroup agreement and, in close cooperation with the Greek authorities, provide more clarity on the post-programme support for the Greek economy.", "These actions will improve the investment climate and attract foreign direct investment.", "This, in turn, will facilitate the return to financial normality after seven years of significant sacrifices by the Greek people.", "More flexible economic structures coupled with sound institutions
