H.

perceived lack of specialized project management support in ULBs; non-transparent budgeting and accounting systems in many of the ULBs and limited exit route for investors due to lack of secondary market trading.", "To address these issues some of the measures which could be considered, are strengthening the governance structure of the municipal issuers by ring fencing the municipal bond funds;

K. Viswanathan which has just submitted its report.", "The Committee has come out with the draft legal framework for resolving matters of insolvency and bankruptcy which, when fully implemented, will have far reaching impact.", "Early enactment of this proposed legislation and the follow-up action will be a game changer for development of corporate bond markets.", "Cap on borrowings of corporate from banks for capital purpose 21.", "Restricting the proportion of borrowings by large corporates from banks and making such corporates use the market mechanism (such as, corporate bonds, commercial papers and other instruments) to meet a part of their short term as well as long term financing needs will help in the development of corporate bonds markets.", "Reserve Bank has already issued a Discussion Paper on \"Large Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism\" on March 27, 2015.", "Resolving distribution tax related issue for securitization 22.",

level to taxation in the hands of investors.", "Rationalisation of stamp duty norms 23.", "In terms of the provisions of entry 91 of Union List, the Central Government has the power to levy stamp duty

demand for good quality corporate paper.", "Activating the repo market 25.", "The reasons cited for lack of interest in corporate bond repo include non-signing of the Global Master Repo Agreement (GMRA), lack of lenders such as mutual funds and insurance companies in repo market, etc.", "Reserve Bank is engaging with other regulators to address these issues.", "It is also envisaged to widen the participation base in corporate debt repo by allowing more investors in repo market.", "Internationally, GMRA is the standard document used by the market participants to undertake repo transactions.", "In India also, we have adopted the same document.", "Market participants need to highlight the specific issues in GMRA which need to be addressed.", "Kickstarting CDS market 27.", "Unavailability of credit risk transfer mechanism in the corporate bond market works as a deterrent.", "Though CDS has been introduced in India, there is no activity in the market.", "One of the major constraints is restriction on netting of MTM position against the same counterparty for capital adequacy and exposure norms.", "Without netting, the trades in CDS have become capital intensive as banks and PDs have to provide higher capital charge on gross basis even if they are acting as market makers and having positive and negative position against the same counterparty.", "Netting has not been allowed due to lack of legal clarity.", "To provide clarity on the enforceability of netting including close-out netting, suitable amendments to provisions in the RBI Act are being proposed.", "Regulators are also examining the possibility of allowing more entities to buy/sell protection through CDS.", "Availability of more number of protection sellers will encourage activity in the CDS

guidelines.", "Use of banks' PCE facility by corporates 30.", "Partial credit enhancements (PCE) by banks may give a boost to the corporate bond market in its evolution phase.", "Taking into account the feedback received, RBI has now issued the final guidelines under which the banks may provide PCE to support (senior) project bonds issued by companies/SPVs, and thereby improve the credit rating of the bond issue making them more attractive to certain specific set of investors, such as the institutional and long term investors.", "It is expected that issuers will take advantage of the scheme to issue long term bonds.", "Though indices, such as, Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex index serve as popular benchmarks for equities, designing debt indices has posed challenges in India as the market lacks breadth and depth.", "Market participants, however, need a debt index to compare the performance in corporate debt vis-a-vis the performance of different asset classes.", "More work needs to be done in this area by benchmark and index companies.", "Concluding Thoughts 32.", "A well-developed corporate bond market can truly address some of the travails of the existing bank-based financial system.", "Development of efficient and robust bond markets is a challenge globally and only a few jurisdictions can claim to have genuine local currency bond markets.", "Even in those markets, the concerns relating to market illiquidity are increasingly being highlighted.", "The recent IMF Global Financial Stability Report has discussed these factors at length.", "While many of the factors may not be of immediate relevance to our market, the experience may hold important lessons as the regulatory regimes and market systems across jurisdictions which are increasingly becoming homogenized.", "While regulatory changes are likely to have had mixed effects on market liquidity, several structural drivers, such as, concentrated holdings by institutional investors, growth of electronic platforms and high frequency trading, reduced market making, etc.", "have also played a part.", "We will have to assess the implications of these factors, including the emerging regulatory regime, on corporate bond market development.", "While it is recognized that the regulatory regime may need to respond positively to some of the critical issues unless the structural factors mentioned earlier are addressed, it would be difficult to have a deep corporate bond market.", "Early implementation of the draft bankruptcy code submitted by the Viswanathan Committee alongwith providing legal certainty to close-out netting for certain transactions would address the two key issues for enabling a credit market.", "Work is already underway in addressing some of the market infrastructure issues, including development of an electronic platform for repo in corporate bonds.", "Market making in corporate bonds has proved to be a challenging issue, particularly the funding of brokers.", "Banks are explicitly permitted to fund market making activities but at the end of day, it will be their call based on commercial judgement.", "Separate structure for market making with direct/indirect support of the Government could be a possible way out.", "It is also important to recognize that the path towards creating an enabling environment may be fraught with event-specific hurdles which may take the process a few steps back.", "The recent case of default on a top rated bond is a case in point.", "More than the fact of default, some of the market practices that have come to light through media reports can dent the confidence of investors in the market.", "This particular instance reiterates the importance of strong market practices and institutional frameworks in development of healthy markets.", "While there is a continuing, concerted effort to identify the constraints and address them in right earnest, we must, however, be careful that our pursuit of perfect bond markets does not end up as an endless chimerical chase.", "Bond markets are part of a broader ecosystem and it would be best if these markets evolve organically.", "As a regulator, our endeavor is to continually facilitate an enabling framework.", "The group set up under the aegis of the FSDC is expected to look into the whole gamut of issues, mostly focusing on the recommendations of all the earlier committees.", "One can expect more exciting times ahead for the development of the corporate bond market in India."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
