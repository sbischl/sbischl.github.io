we would be back at war.", "Coincidentally, in the summer of 1944 Paasikivi was discussing the fate of small countries.", "His reading of history had made him a pessimist: \"States act for raison d'etat, i.e.", "in the interests of the State.", "It is frightful, blood-red\".", "He went on: \"To date no system has been devised that would constrain raison d'etat and protect other countries from them.\"", "Where Monnet spoke of nationalism and national sovereignty, Paasikivi wrote about raison d'etat.", "Ultimately, they were both talking about the same thing.", "Paasikivi saw the key issue as how to limit raison d'etat, whereas Monnet saw the basic problem as how to limit national sovereignty.", "Paasikivi's starting point was the lot of the small country, but his thinking went further than this: problem of limiting raison d'etat and its relationship to morality is an issue that, although primarily affecting the future of small countries, will ultimately also determine the future of larger countries and the whole of mankind.\"", "History had made Paasikivi not only pessimistic, but also cautious.", "When Monnet was accused of being over-optimistic in connection with his numerous initiatives, he always replied: \"I am not an optimist, I am determined\".", "For his part, Schuman summarized his own thinking in his unpublished memoirs: \"The harsh lessons of history have taught me, as a man from a border area, that I should be wary of hasty improvisation and over-ambitious projects, but they have also taught me that when an objective judgment, founded in mature reflection and based on actual facts and the overriding interests of mankind, leads us into new or even revolutionary endeavors, we should remain steadfast and persevere with them.\"", "The birth of a great idea The paths of the cautious foreign minister from Alsace-Lorraine, Robert Schuman, and the bold man of action, Jean Monnet, crossed in the post-war years.", "In February 1950 Monnet went on a two-week cross-country skiing trip in the Alps.", "Although having a guide to mark out the ski route, Monnet was on his own in blazing the conceptual trail that led to the pioneering thoughts he put down on paper each evening.", "By the time he returned his proposal was ready: France should take the initiative on setting up a coal and steel union.", "This would resolve the difficult dispute over the management of coal and steel and normalize relations between France and Germany.", "Another statesman also had his best ideas while out skiing and jogging, our president after Paasikivi, namely Urho Kekkonen.", "In March 1950, Monnet began indirectly conveying his ideas to Schuman and eventually at the end of April he presented his complete plan.", "On May Day Schuman sent a message to Monnet: proposal.", "I'll make it my own\".", "The core of Schuman's initiative was that the member States would agree to pool their national sovereignty in the area of coal and steel under the umbrella of a community.", "The community was to be run by a High Authority (the forerunner of the European Commission) that would be independent of the member countries' governments.", "The Community would be set up on the basis of a Treaty to be ratified by the parliaments of the member countries.", "Schuman thought it important that the make-up of the High Authority should ensure balance between the smaller and larger countries.", "Schuman's initiative was enthusiastically welcomed by the public.", "The reaction in the political world was more mixed.", "It cleared up many issues for Germany and Adenauer.", "The Christian Democrats supported the plan unreservedly.", "The opposition Social Democrat party conference was against it.", "Only one young little-known Member of Parliament spoke out strongly in support of the plan.", "His name was Willy Brandt.", "It was not an easy ride in France.", "The centre, which Schuman represented, and the Socialists supported the plan.", "The Communists were against it, as were the Gaullists, since they did not approve of transferring national sovereignty to a High Authority.", "The reaction in Italy was immediately positive.", "In the Benelux countries it took somewhat longer for the idea to become established.", "Britain's negative stance hardly came as a surprise.", "Schuman entrusted Monnet with the task of leading the negotiations on establishing the Community, which was also given an Assembly and a Court.", "The Assembly was to monitor the High Authority and the Court of Justice was to supervise the implementation of the Treaty.", "However, as so often happens, at the political level and for the then foreign minister, Schuman, there was still some tricky negotiating to be done: decisions had to be reached on where the Community's headquarters were to be based, the official language and the composition of the High Authority.", "The compromise that was negotiated by Schuman is now standard Community practice: instead of just French, as had been proposed, the languages of all the member countries were made official languages and the headquarters were split in two.", "The Assembly went to Strasbourg and the High Authority and Court of Justice to Luxembourg.", "The Treaty finally came into force in July 1952 and the High Authority opened for business in Luxembourg a month later with Jean Monnet as its President.", "At the same time Schuman's position as France's foreign minister was under threat.", "He was particularly targeted by the Gaullists and the Radicals because of his policy on Europe.", "Pinay's government eventually fell in December 1952.", "The formal reason was budget controversy, but behind this there were also disagreements over European policy.", "Schuman stepped down as foreign minister in January 1953.", "He offered to give up his post so that he could support Rene Meyer, who represented the same policy on Europe, as the choice for prime minister.", "That was the last time Schuman was to serve in a French government.", "\"An intelligent and charming guest in Finland\" Several weeks later the Finnish Foreign Trade Association was trying to find a speaker to its meeting.", "Heikki Brotherus, the press counselor to the embassy in Paris, knew Schuman, since he had met him at Quaker functions.", "And now that Schuman had left the government, Brotherus thought that he would be an ideal candidate.", "The leadership of the Foreign Trade Association were delighted.", "But then the difficulties began.", "Brotherus received a letter from Mr Tarjanne, permanent secretary of Foreign Ministry, accusing him of arbitrary conduct.", "Brotherus responded to the charge in writing.", "Everyone knew about the affair, except the ambassador, Johan Helo.", "But that was how many things were dealt with at the embassy in Paris at the time.", "Helo had been appointed ambassador in the new wave after the war as one of the so-called Six.", "Helo's relations with the foreign minister were difficult, but Paasikivi protected Helo right until the end of his period of office.", "According to Brotherus, the foreign minister even went as far as asking the French ambassador in Helsinki to cancel Schuman's planned visit to Finland.", "Paasikivi does state in his diaries that the foreign minister, To\u0308rngren, said on 24 March, in connection with his weekly visit, that the Foreign Trade Association wanted to make a big event out of Schuman's visit, but that the government was not interested in organizing any dinner reception or in devoting any other particular attention to Schuman.", "Despite the awkwardness of the arrangements, Schuman came to Finland on a visit in April, three months after he had left the government.", "Schuman's visit was given enormous coverage in the press.", "In his presentation Schuman stressed that all wars had had their beginnings in precisely six states.", "\"By defusing this hotbed of war, we have done something really fundamental for peace in Europe,\" he stated.", "The government did not in fact organize a dinner or devote any particular attention to Schuman, unless one counts the supper invitation by social affairs minister, Vaino Leskinen, at the Helsinki community hall, where Schuman was to meet some trade union people.", "President Paasikivi was, however, present at Schuman's presentation and also had an audience with him.", "Paasikivi wrote in his diaries about the pleasant impression Schuman had made on him.", "Schuman believed that the antagonism between France and Germany would gradually be removed and that the Coal and Steel Community would be a step towards this.", "Paasikivi went on: \"I explained my own view and the position of Finland.", "Schuman is indeed an intelligent and charming man\".", "It was typical of the period that Pravda reported on the visit a week later.", "According to Pravda, Schuman's visit was undeniably connected with the discussions, which the right-wing socialists had launched, against stepping up trade between Finland and the Soviet Union.", "So Leskinen did not escape criticism.", "The article had been put together by Stefan Smirnov, a great expert on Finland.", "Jean Monnet never met Paasikivi.", "However, in October 1962 in connection with President Kekkonen's Helsingin Sanomat visit to France the newspaper wrote a one-column news-in-brief item on Kekkonen's meeting with the \"father of Europe\".", "The item said that the President had visited Carre\u0301's house outside Paris.", "Louis Carre\u0301 was a distinguished Parisian gallery-owner and prominent admirer of Alvar Aalto, the Finnish architect.", "Aalto had, in fact designed Carre\u0301's home.", "Carre\u0301 was a neighbour of Monnet's, which is why Monnet was also invited to meet the important guest.", "According to the newspaper, despite being 74, \"Mr Europe\" came across as being extremely alert and sprightly.", "Monnet and Kekkonen had a long talk in English, although the newspaper did not report about its content.", "President Kekkonen was visiting France, at that time, upon the invitation of President Charles de Gaulle.", "This was a time when de Gaulle and Monnet were in deep disagreement over European issues.", "President de Gaulle considered national sovereignty untouchable while Monnet considered its limitation to be the key to European integration.", "Monnet believed that independent European institutions were the corner-stone of Europe, de Gaulle was, on the other hand, a strong opponent of their independence.", "So President Kekkonen had an opportunity to hear both views.", "Unfortunately, we have no records about his discussions with Jean Monnet.", "Finland's long road Europe managed to fit in a lot between Paasikivi's meeting with Schuman and Kekkonen's meeting with Monnet.", "France's plan for a European Defence Community (the EDC) had collapsed under opposition from the French National Assembly.", "However, at the instigation of the Benelux countries negotiations were launched on setting up a European Economic Community (the EEC).", "The negotiations culminated in the conclusion of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.", "Under the terms of this Treaty the member states pooled their national sovereignties together in certain clearly defined areas, namely customs policy, trade policy, competition policy and agricultural policy.", "The bottom line for the states that founded the EEC was that together the countries of Europe would be greater and stronger than alone.", "With Community backing the member states would derive economic and political 'value added' which they could not achieve individually.", "Finland was far away from all of this.", "The Soviet Union saw the EEC as a western alliance and not as a partner.", "Finland had little room for manoeuvre and every move was closely scrutinized and watched.", "In Finland European integration was little known -
