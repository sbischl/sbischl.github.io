about risks related to shadow banking or industrial overcapacity in China.", "Xiaochuan would always answer these questions, as well as those from other governors, with a disarming candour and clarity, never avoiding the hard issues.", "This not only helped to build trust among his counterparts in the international community but also endeared Xiaochuan to many of us as someone we could count on for insights into the complexities of the Chinese economy and financial system.", "Today, Dr Zhou will speak on \"The Rise of Technology in Finance -
