envisioned in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).", "The realisation of the AEC by 2015 will result in an even more tightly integrated region, and this has opened up more opportunities for corporates as well as investors.", "A key principle underpinning the AEC 2015 is the free flow of goods, services and investment within the region by 2015.", "Let me update you on the progress so far.", "On

between ASEAN and six other countries, namely Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, India and South Korea.", "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and Renminbi (RMB) Internationalisation This agreement builds upon the existing ASEAN+1 free trade agreements (FTAs) FTAs by bringing together ASEAN's existing FTAs with its key partners into a single comprehensive agreement.", "RCEP will be one of the biggest FTAs in the world, covering 3 billion people and accounting for one-third of the world's GDP.", "RCEP is a significant agreement for ASEAN.", "It is an ambitious attempt to deepen regional economic integration and to link ASEAN's various trading partners, many of whom do not have existing trade agreements with one another.", "One key partner for ASEAN in RCEP is China.", "China will continue to play an increasingly important role in trade with ASEAN, and this will grow even further with its participation in RCEP.", "In 2012, ASEAN-China trade volumes reached a record high of US$400 billion, and by 2015, ASEAN is expected to be China's top trading partner.", "As a result, in the next few years, we can expect a greater acceptance and use of the Renminbi (RMB) as a trade settlement currency, especially in ASEAN.", "What does this mean for us?", "China has already signed bilateral currency swap arrangements with key ASEAN countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.", "Corporates, investors and financial institutions need to be prepared if they are to capitalise on the opportunities brought on by the increasing internationalisation of the RMB.", "In February this year, Singapore became the first country outside Greater China to have a Renminbi clearing bank when the Singapore branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was designated as such.", "This was followed by MAS and the People's Bank of China signing an enhanced bilateral currency swap agreement in April.", "The appointment of a Renminbi clearing bank in

financial centre that serves Asia and beyond.", "Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Besides the RCEP, Singapore is also actively engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or the TPP.", "The TPP negotiations currently involve 11 countries: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States.", "It aims to bring comprehensive duty-free market access as well as reduced restrictions on services, investment and government procurement.", "It also seeks to enhance regional connectivity by reducing behind-the-border non-tariff trade barriers and promoting consistency in regulation across all the member countries.", "Singapore views the TPP, along with the RCEP, as complementary tracks that will lead towards increased regional integration, and eventually, to a Free Trade Agreement of the Asia Pacific.", "The recent decision by Japan to join the TPP will further reinforce the TPP as a platform for broader economic integration across the Pacific.", "With Japan's inclusion, the TPP's membership has now expanded to 12 countries.", "This represents nearly 40 per cent of the global economy and one-third of world

cent to 8.9 million units.", "As a result of the economic policies being implemented by the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, we may increasingly see some spillover effects on ASEAN and other Asian economies.", "ASEAN, however, is unlikely to be too negatively affected and may instead benefit from a weaker yen given its role as a \"downstream producer\" for Japan.", "For example, countries that serve as a production hub for Japanese companies are likely to benefit from Japan's increased export competitiveness.", "Overall, stronger Japanese growth is expected to stimulate its imports from ASEAN.", "In contrast, economies with a high degree of export similarity to Japan, such as Korea, and to some extent Taiwan, could face greater competition in the short run due to the negative substitution effect favouring relatively cheaper Japanese goods.", "We may also see increased capital inflows into the region, as Japanese institutions are increasingly hard-pressed to secure adequate returns at home.", "As long-term interest rates decline further in Japan due to the Bank of Japan's new asset purchase programme, we can expect more \"search for yield\" activities.", "As interest rates are already very low in the region and asset price inflation is becoming a concern in many economies, ASEAN policy makers need to remain vigilant against a build-up of domestic financial and asset market excesses.", "EU-Singapore FTA (EUSFTA) Finally, as we seek to maintain an open economy and to stay relevant, Singapore will work on deepening our engagement beyond the Asia Pacific, for example, with the EU.", "Negotiations on the EU-Singapore FTA were recently concluded.", "This is the first FTA which the EU has concluded with an ASEAN country.", "The EU-Singapore FTA can serve as a

role as a trusted and modern financial hub by expanding into new services, such as offshore Renminbi trading.", "These initiatives will help investors and companies based in Singapore to \"open doors\" and \"unlock value\".", "Let me once again express my appreciation to Deutsche Bank for holding the annual Deutsche Bank Access Asia Conference in Singapore and bringing together thought
