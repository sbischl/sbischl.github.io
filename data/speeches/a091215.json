again - that the financial system imparts its own dynamic that reinforces the natural cyclical tendency in an economy.", "In good times, lenders and investors tend to be confident and act with less caution.", "Standards decline and banks come under pressure either to use \"surplus\" capital or return it to shareholders.", "Backward-looking risk metrics present risk as low just when it is reaching dangerous levels and very high when everyone has already become much more risk averse.", "This all serves to fuel the boom and bust.", "Many commentators have argued that accounting standards contributed to pro-cyclicality.", "Fair-value accounting and buoyant markets make for strong valuations that can boost recorded profit, but problems emerge when banks have to mark-to-market securities whose markets have effectively ceased to function.", "The incurred-loss basis for provisions - where an event has to occur before a provision can be made - promotes transparency in one sense.", "But it arguably inhibits the build-up of buffers in the good times to cushion against future losses, and prompts more provisioning during the turmoil, further harming profitability and confidence.", "Other incentives have also been seen as adding to cyclical behaviour.", "Remuneration packages for some financial institutions' executives and employees appear to have been structured in a way that may have encouraged traders and managers to take excessive risks in activities that appeared profitable in the short term but led to large losses later on.", "People have also pointed to the role of earlier regulatory changes, credit ratings, the complexity of instruments and weaknesses in market infrastructure, not to mention the long period of low global interest rates, the \"global imbalances\" and so on as all playing a role.", "I don't want to underplay those factors, but the five above are the big themes on which I want to focus today.", "Much has already been done, or is underway, to respond to these weaknesses by the various standard-setters, the Financial Stability Board and within the G20 process.", "Many of the responses can be organised under the same five headings.", "First among them is capital regulation.", "Now it is worth pointing out, before going on, that it is something of a stretch to suggest, as some commentators have, that the so-called Basel II framework was to blame for the crisis.", "In fact the build-up to the crisis occurred under the old Basel I capital rules: most global banks did not even implement Basel II until after the crisis had begun.", "US banks are still not using it.", "Basel II is not perfect but it addresses some of the shortcomings of Basel I that were identified by the financial crisis.", "It allows, for example, greater differentiation between different types of risk, introduces capital charges for offbalance sheet exposures to structured investment vehicles and conduits, and creates more neutral incentives between holding assets on balance sheet and securitising them.", "Had Basel II been in place, it might not have prevented the crisis but it would probably have helped matters.", "Nonetheless, Basel II can be improved in the light of experience during the crisis.", "The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision is in the process of implementing numerous changes, which essentially require more capital and higher-quality capital.", "It has already finalised changes to risk weights on certain exposures related to securitisation, and issued new supervisory guidance on compensation, governance, risk management and concentrations of risk.", "It has changed rules around disclosure and valuation practices, which will come into effect at the end of next year.", "The Committee is currently rethinking the amount of high-quality capital banks should hold, specifying what instruments should be included in that definition, and developing a non-risk-weighted simple leverage ratio as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital adequacy measures.", "The Committee intends to finalise this latter set of new capital rules by the end of this year and calibrate them in 2010 with a detailed \"quantitative impact assessment\" to gauge their effects.", "Second, efforts to bolster liquidity management are underway, with the Basel Committee planning to introduce a new global standard for funding liquidity soon.", "This is likely to require financial institutions to focus on adequate funding liquidity over longer time horizons, as well as resilience to more demanding stress scenarios.", "In line with this, APRA has recently released for consultation proposals to enhance liquidity risk management by authorised deposit-taking institutions in Australia.", "Third, the regulatory perimeter is being extended.", "Some of the relatively less supervised institutions that were problematic prior to the crisis no longer exist -

depositors and borrowers - will also pay via higher spreads between what lenders pay for funds and what they charge for loans.", "That is, they will pay more ex ante to use a safer financial system, as opposed to taxpayers having to pay large costs ex post to re-capitalise a riskier system that runs into trouble.", "Now of course protecting the interests of taxpayers is very important, and there is no doubt that certain types of behaviour need to be backed with much more capital, if not severely curtailed or even stopped altogether.", "It is appropriate that pricing play a role in achieving that.", "We should try to ensure, however, that the cost is no more than necessary.", "The most egregious behaviour was mainly that of 30 to 40 large, globally active banks.", "They have imposed very large costs on their own banking systems, economies and taxpayers, and on the global economy.", "But there are thousands of other banks in the world whose risk appetite did not get out of control, that have remained solvent, and that have not needed public capital injections.", "So it will be sensible to ensure, as far as we can, that the proposed measures act effectively to constrain the worst excesses of the former without unnecessarily shackling the latter.", "I am personally not persuaded of the intellectual basis of the simple overall leverage ratio.", "It goes against the whole thrust of the idea that capital should be allocated against economic risk - after all, the Basel risk weights are a sophisticated leverage ratio already.", "I have not seen persuasive evidence that the banks of countries that had a leverage ratio in place have systematically outperformed those that did not.", "Nonetheless, it had already been agreed, before Australian officials joined the Basel Committee, that such a device would be introduced as a \"back-stop\" to prevent extreme leverage in instances where the Basel rules, for some reason, may not.", "Provided that it is suitably calibrated, the leverage ratio will probably not do any great harm.", "That is, however, a very important provision.", "Were it to be calibrated in a way that unnecessarily constrains the common or garden variety commercial bank, it could be unduly costly.", "So the calibration is important and in this regard it is critical that adequate time be allowed for the completion of the technical work in assessing the quantitative impact of this measure.", "That will take at least another year.", "As far as the proposed counter-cyclical capital buffers are concerned, this is an appealing idea, based on the notion that it is precisely at the moment when capital appears to be abundant, profits high and the economy booming that true risk is approaching its peak.", "Requiring more capital to be put aside at that time, which can then support balance sheets after the cycle turns, sounds very desirable.", "But we should not think it will be easy to achieve.", "The proposals appear to involve balancing a degree of mechanical linkage to particular variables - such as credit - with an appropriate degree of short-term flexibility.", "Those familiar with the old debates about rules versus discretion in monetary policy might notice an echo here.", "Based on experience in monetary policy, I am sceptical about the durability of hard rules, but all too familiar with how difficult it can be to deliver genuinely counter-cyclical policy.", "There is no reason to think it will really be easier when using prudential tools for \"macro-prudential\" purposes.", "That is not to say that we can't devise a framework combining certain rule-like behaviour with a sensible degree of discretion, but it might take a while.", "In the case of monetary policy, it took a couple of decades or more.", "If one is inclined to place a good deal of importance on quality supervisory judgement - as I think we have to - as much may be achieved by adjustments to accounting arrangements for provisions as by a complex set of variable capital ratios.", "What is needed is to allow banks more easily to make more forward-looking provisions when either they or the supervisor thinks they should.", "This is an important area of work for regulators.", "One should also be realistic that while using balance sheet regulation as a macro-prudential tool may have attractions, it is no panacea.", "Of course there may be occasions when the setting of monetary policy is about right for most of the economy but there is a desire to calm down some over-exuberant borrowing behaviour in a particular sector.", "In such cases, some kind of temporary regulatory measure may well be useful.", "But as those with any recollection of Australian experience of the 1960s and 1970s will know, if the fundamental problem is actually that financial conditions are just too easy - that is, interest rates are too low - balance sheet regulation won't ultimately constrain credit growth.", "Over time, private markets will find a way of doing the business outside of the regulated sector.", "Then the authorities face the question of whether or not to expand the scope of regulation to more sectors - just as we did in the 1970s.", "A possible outcome is that, the harder we regulate a set of institutions as a result of the last crisis, the more likely it becomes that the next crisis occurs in the hitherto unregulated part, perhaps even among institutions that do not yet exist.", "If the conditions are such that people want to take risk and gear up, they will find a way.", "Of course, that is acceptable provided the relevant private parties can be allowed to fail without bringing down the core part of the system.", "Caveat emptor can apply outside of the regulated net if there are few spillovers.", "But if risk-taking activity goes on long enough, then sufficient leverage may well accumulate somewhere to make the ensuing deleveraging generally disruptive, placing policy-makers once again in a very awkward situation.", "And that brings us to the most difficult of all the issues, namely that of the too-big-to-fail institution.", "Here the term \"big\" might mean a large balance sheet, or refer to interconnectedness or complexity.", "Or all three of the above.", "In some countries, the debate on this issue is now quite active.", "One potential response is a tax on size: much higher capital requirements for \"systemic\" institutions so as to lower greatly the probability of a failure of a really large firm, either by making large firms much less risky, or giving them an incentive to no longer be large.", "Another approach would simply be much more intensive - and intrusive - supervision of such entities.", "Either of these measures could be complemented by the requirement that a large firm compile a \"living will\", in which it writes its own break-up/winddown plan ahead of time - in the process, hopefully, highlighting those bits of complexity that ought to be removed while it is still alive.", "Before regulators even got to any of those possibilities, they would have to grapple with the practical difficulties of setting the threshold as to what constitutes \"systemic\".", "Expect furious lobbying by the finance sector on that.", "Nor is this issue just domestic in nature.", "It goes to the heart of what it means to have a globalised financial system.", "In the absence of clearly articulated rules about burden sharing, a potential failure of one of these institutions is further complicated because the frameworks for global governance and crisis resolution have not kept up with the process of globalisation itself.", "It is very hard for them to do so.", "Even in a region such as Europe where there has been six decades of continuous effort in building collective structures, the resolution of problems at entities like Fortis has, by all accounts, been very difficult.", "One response to that would be to unwind the globalisation of the financial institutions and go back to having local banks just doing local business.", "That seems absurdly costly, though - in general, capital flows have been a tremendous force for higher living standards over the long run.", "It would surely be a retrograde step to shut them off.", "A less radical response would be subsidiarisation - where foreign banks have a presence in the form of locally capitalised and governed structures, in which local authorities could intervene in the event of a shock in another country affecting the viability of the parent.", "That still entails some costs in terms of efficiency, albeit ones that countries might now be prepared to tolerate.", "To succeed in this approach, a country would need to have the capability and resources to ensure the viability of a local subsidiary of a failed major global institution, taking control of it if necessary.", "This would be at a time of tremendous damage to the relevant global brand.", "For many small countries this might be a big ask.", "In the crisis itself, the too-big-to-fail issue presented simply as an imperative for a number of governments to prevent failures.", "But as the crisis recedes, and the global financial system is gradually nursed back to health, it is this issue that is going to leave the biggest lingering challenge.", "The Financial Stability Board will be directing particular attention to it over the coming year.", "It is not likely to be amenable to simple solutions, or easy ones.", "In the mean time, enormous moral hazard, perhaps greater than ever before, exists in the global financial system as a result of the actions - albeit essential ones in the circumstances - of 2008.", "A year ago, I wished this audience a much less interesting 2009.", "That wish was partly fulfilled in that 2009 was less \"interesting\" than 2008, though still not quite boring enough in my view.", "As 2009 draws to a close, things in the global financial system look much less worrying than they did a year ago.", "With the sense of immediate crisis much reduced, regulators can devote more focus to the job of designing and implementing changes to regulatory frameworks -
