I would hazard a figure of at least 80-90% - of the overall hardship that followed the bursting of the bubble, was (albeit unbeknownst to the decision-makers that night) already inescapably embedded in the situation.", "The damage had been made unavoidable by the unrestrained credit and property boom.", "(The fiscal austerity measures that have had to be taken are not just due to the \u20ac40 billion or so in additional net debt that can be linked to the guarantee, but also reflect the far larger impact of the ending of the construction boom on the Government's tax revenue and spending needs.", "And the fiscal costs are only one aspect of the total damage to Ireland).", "In my letter to the Inquiry of February 12, I have distinguished between a hypothetical \"hindsight\" scenario (1), in which the Government would have been convincingly advised of the actual likely magnitude of the cost of a guarantee, and the actual scenario (2) with only the information available at the time.", "In the actual case the Government had no information at hand indicating that any of the banks were about to experience losses far in excess of their capital reserves.", "What I have suggested as the best course of action (given the lack of such information Scenario 2) - buying time for negotiation with partners, seizing control over the two failing banks, and limiting the scope of the guarantee - could hardly (unless those negotiations had proved remarkably successful) have reduced the direct fiscal bill by more than a few billion - a fraction of the actual damage.", "The alternative (under the hindsight Scenario 1) of bailing-in some of the bondholders and depositors of Anglo and INBS would have imposed additional disruption to economic activity and capital formation which would have offset a lot of the savings to the State from not paying the creditors.", "I conclude that the need for \"austerity measures\": the scale of tax increases and expenditure reductions that have proved necessary since, could have been reduced somewhat, but not all that much, by anything done at the end of September 2008.", "Maintaining perspective As I have remarked recently, the boom and the bust both damaged our economy.", "The boom, and the decisions that were taken during it, meant that Ireland had to adjust down from living standards that could never have been sustained, with sizeable and capricious shifts in the distribution of wealth.", "The style of banking in Ireland, its regulation and broader economic policy were strongly influenced by comparable styles adopted at that time in countries often used as exemplars for Irish decision makers, and in particular the US and UK.", "But the scale of the excesses in Ireland put its banking crisis in a different league (though not as bad as Iceland).", "The extent and nature of the guarantee decision frustrated subsequent efforts to minimise the costs and speed the recovery.", "But the bulk of these costs could not have been avoided by a different course of action on the night of the guarantee."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "financial dominance", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "financial dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "fiscal dominance", "fiscal dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Government guarantee", "Banking crisis", "Financial stability", "Regulatory policy", "Bank restructuring", "Bondholders", "Depositors", "Fiscal cost", "Economic damage", "Austerity measures"]}
