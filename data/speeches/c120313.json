which is represented tonight by Ravin Dajee, Chairman of the Mauritius Bankers Association, and James Benoit, Vice Chairman of the Association, in their normal working life, CEO of Barclays Bank Mauritius and the CEO of Afrasia Bank, respectively.", "The relative success that Mauritius has achieved in economic and social development rests on the solid bedrock of regular public/private dialogue.", "At the core of this is the dialogue between the Bank and the CEO's of all banks in Mauritius - which is unmatched in its regularity, its frequency and its intensity - which has helped us enormously to shield our small open and vulnerable economy from the crisis.", "The award is thus a tribute to the collective contribution of the Government, the Central Bank, the banking industry, and the Mauritian private sector.", "I would like to think of this distinction as a celebration of the progress of my country towards economic and social salvation.", "The crisis throws up new and unexpected problems around the world everyday: uncertainty persists in financial markets; spillovers on the real economy leave in their wake negative sentiment, poor growth and tenacious unemployment levels; fiscal and debt sustainability concerns cause serious apprehension; and reduced incomes depress consumption and investment levels.", "Amidst such global mayhem, our resource-constrained country surprisingly fared quite well.", "We have posted positive growth rates throughout the crisis, averaging 4 per cent per year or not far below trend levels.", "Unemployment is at 8 per cent, a far cry from the rising joblessness in some of our major markets.", "Inflation has come down.", "Reserves have gone up.", "Our banks are solid and well-capitalised.", "I can be forgiven for believing that smallness is no longer a liability.", "Quite the contrary: it can be a source of added adaptive advantage.", "It gives our policymakers a quick-response capacity and the flexibility to change gear quite rapidly to adapt to the constantly-changing environment that has become the new normal.", "And this is what has so far spared Mauritius from the worst effects of the crisis.", "My five years as Governor coincide almost perfectly with the run of the crisis.", "As can be expected, they have certainly not been de tout repos.", "I initiated the practice of issuing an annual Letter to Stakeholders, where I highlight the activities of the central bank during the past year.", "I titled my last letter, issued two weeks ago, \"Pummeled, Hammered, Buffeted...But Still on Course!\".", "I was referring to the economy, but the title may also serve as a short-hand description of my own tenure as Governor.", "Pummeled, hammered, buffeted, I may have been but, through thick and thin, I have kept my eyes firmly focused on the best interest of the nation as I sought to live up to the trust placed in me to lead the Bank of Mauritius.", "Governors have a very tough job in a crisis-ridden world.", "They are constantly the subject of public scrutiny.", "They are the butt of jokes, the target of criticism, the object of much invective, with their fitness - occasionally their very sanity - being publicly questioned.", "They walk a tight rope most of the time.", "They need to take bold and timely decisions that make them unpopular.", "If they shirk such decisions, they court disaster.", "It is a case of \"damned if they do, and damned if they don't\".", "Yet, they have to remain resolute, determined to do whatever their job entails.", "If they are unlucky, they are terminated, with their gubernatorial life being -

I can assure you I am not lost for words when it comes to gratitude - but time constraints and your patience prevent me from doing that.", "I thank my mother, my wife of 40 years, my son and my daughter for the sacrifices they have silently endured, while I was away from home - which was most of the time, since even when I was there physically, I was not really there - I am your proverbial absentee parent - absorbed by my other concerns and responsibilities.", "I thank my wider family who share my patronym for stoically accepting their lot when they have had to take part of the flak as I have never ceased being publicly lambasted and pilloried, and called all manner of names - some of which you cannot mention in polite company - since I traded the comfort and anonymity of the civil service mandarinate for the hurly-burly of politics and the unrelenting public spotlight in an unforgiving environment where fair comment has long lost the battle against outrageous libel and quasi-criminal defamation.", "Some, closely-related, regret the shared patronym and have been known to disown the connection.", "Lately, others - quite unrelated - claim a close relation.", "My professional career was much enriched by my interaction with colleagues from the World Bank, the IMF, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and elsewhere.", "I thank Michel Devaux and Paul Blay, both of the World Bank, and both here tonight, for the great support they gave in the dark days when Mauritius was a patient in intensive care, undergoing structural adjustment in the early 1980's, and for their friendship ever since.", "I thank Bishnu Persaud for his support in equally-critical work on small island-states.", "I thank Percy Mistry for being a goading critic and a constant source of encouragement.", "I thank Mihaela Smith, and through her, the entire network of the Commonwealth Partnership for Technology Management, for always pushing me in new directions at that critical interface where academia and technology intersect the world of politics.", "I thank Ian Downing for being such a great Master of Ceremonies tonight.", "I thank Maurice Lam and the Board of Investment for sponsoring this event.", "I thank The Banker for having provided the reason to bring us all together.", "And thank you very much, all of you, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, for gracing the occasion with your valued presence.", "Finally, beyond those I have mentioned and all of you present here tonight, I am also grateful to all those who, one way or another, extended some moral support to me in times of need.", "I am referring here, in the words of Luther King, to all those \"people who make a successful journey possible -
