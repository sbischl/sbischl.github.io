an area of study, and a personal passion, for the past two decades.", "I could talk about r-star at great length, but you may be relieved to hear that for the purpose of this speech, there's just one point I want to make: r-star has fallen, not only in the U.S., but around the world.", "Fundamental shifts have been occurring in the two main drivers of r-star over the past two decades: demographics

"This story-of low interest rates, low inflation, and slow growth-is showing up in the data.", "The latest numbers from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) follow the recent trend of steady downward

decisions.", "Trade negotiations and Brexit are top of mind when it comes to uncertainty.", "But geopolitical risks and political upheaval are affecting regions across the globe.", "It's striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth.", "Even if the outcomes of current negotiations are ultimately positive-be they between the U.S. and China, or the UK and the European Union (EU)-the uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we're experiencing today.", "Furthermore, the interconnectedness of our economies means that literally, no man is an island.", "If one economy starts to struggle, the spillover effects onto others can take hold rapidly.", "The common thread of geopolitical tensions is that while they're difficult to predict, they're also impossible to ignore.", "On a backdrop of low r-star and slowing global growth, they drive businesses to be more cautious, more vigilant, and more conservative in their approach.", "Data Dependent, Not Data-Point Dependent The long-term factors driving low r-star and slowing global growth, as well as the more near-term geopolitical tensions, are afflictions from which we all suffer.", "So what's the solution?", "Where do we as policymakers, researchers, and regulators go from here?", "At press conferences I'm often asked: if growth slows by X percent, or unemployment increases by Y percent, will that mean that the FOMC is going to do Z at its next meeting?", "If the Fed had a motto, it would probably be \"data dependent.\"", "When asked about this, it's important to clarify that while I'm data dependent, I'm not data-point dependent.", "It's not about being guided by one single data point-GDP or job growth-but by all of the data and information that tell us where the economy is, and where the economy is heading.", "Importantly, it's not about looking at things merely as they are-it's about

decisions we've made this year will continue to have a ripple effect years into the future.", "As policymakers, we need to take in how far-reaching those ripples are going to be.", "The adjustments to monetary policy we made this year were designed to balance maintaining a strong U.S. economy with slowing global growth, and provide insurance against ongoing and potential future risks.", "And that's what they've done.", "The economy is in a good place, and monetary policy is as well.", "My forecast is for moderate GDP growth, the labor market remaining strong, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 percent target.", "Of course, things can change.", "Data dependency remains our motto, and if there were a material change to this outlook, we would adjust monetary policy in support of our goals of maximum employment and price stability.", "I'll conclude with this.", "John Donne's words are perhaps more relevant in 2019 than they were in 1624.", "No man is an island, and no economy
