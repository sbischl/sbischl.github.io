to reap fully the benefits of globalization, policy-makers must weigh its implications and respond effectively to its challenges.", "In my time today, I will discuss these policy challenges, particularly those related to the conduct of monetary policy.", "First, I will talk about how the current wave of globalization differs from previous periods of economic integration, and then I will address some of the economic impacts of globalization.", "Before concluding, I will also say a few words about the current outlook for the Canadian economy, which, not surprisingly, is importantly influenced by global economic developments.", "In some respects, the current wave of globalization resembles earlier episodes.", "There have been occasional periods of intense economic integration over the centuries, most notably during the Roman Empire and in the latter half of the 19th century.", "These have shared several common features: for example, technological innovations that shrank economic distances (e.g., standardized roads, the telegraph and, more recently, the Internet) and, very importantly, governments that pursued supportive economic policies.", "These governments recognized the long-term benefits of economic integration and were large enough to internalize the costs - both political and fiscal - of promoting public goods such as the rule of law; common standards for trade, products, and services; and the liberalization of trade.", "Many of their decisions, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws in England, were unpopular at the time, but ultimately proved beneficial.", "We should all hope that similar courage will begin to guide participants in the current Doha Development Round of trade negotiations.", "So, is there anything different about this period of integration?", "I would argue that there are three aspects.", "First, the sheer scale of the process is unprecedented; second, the relative size of the emerging economies being integrated into the core of the global economy means that their policies matter for advanced economies, as well as for their own; and third, the widespread adoption of supply-chain management by business further enhances the depth of integration.", "In terms of scale, it is safe to say that never in history has economic integration involved so many people, both in raw numbers and as a percentage of the global population.", "For example, when North America and the periphery of Europe were integrated during the latter half of the 19th century, their total population was half the size of the then-advanced countries.", "The comparable ratio for postwar Japan was 10 per cent.", "Contrast that with China and India today, which alone represent 2.5 times the current population of advanced countries.", "Of course, the entire populations of China, India, and other emerging markets are not being instantly integrated into the global economy.", "If you adjust for the percentage of the population in the traded-goods sector, however, the effective global labour supply quadrupled between 1980 and 2005, with most of the increase taking place after 1990.4 This trend is set to continue: The globally integrated labour force is projected to double again by 2050.5 Similarly, the scale of cross-border flows of goods, services, and capital is now unprecedented.", "The global economy has opened dramatically - merchandise exports now make up about 20 per cent of global GDP, compared with about 9 per cent at the height of the last great wave of globalization, roughly a century ago.", "According to research at the OECD, advances in communications technology mean that up to 1 in 5 services are now tradable, although this potential has only just begun to be tapped.", "Cross-border capital flows are now roughly 15 per cent of global GDP, compared with 3 per cent at the turn of the last century.", "The second difference that characterizes this wave of globalization is that, given the relative size of emerging markets, their policies matter.", "For the most part, the economic policies of emerging-market countries have improved the welfare of both their citizens and our own, through the gains from trade.", "With some policies, however, most notably in the degree of exchange rate flexibility and, by extension, in the conduct of their domestic monetary policies, some emerging markets have run great risks.", "In particular, they continue to import, what is, for them, overly loose monetary policy that will ultimately lead to adjustments in the real exchange rate through higher domestic inflation, with the attendant economic distortions, adjustment costs, and risk of a hard landing.", "Moreover, at the global level, there are important spillovers of these policies onto other economies, such as Canada's.", "Export-promotion strategies underpinned by undervalued For a more complete discussion, see A.

a point that has been made repeatedly in Bank of Canada speeches.", "Policy challenges posed by globalization It is plain from this discussion of the economic impact of globalization that it also has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.", "I will touch briefly on four implications that are relevant for the Bank of Canada.", "It should be recognized at the outset, however, that these implications can be conflicting, and none is relentless, so they need to be considered carefully.", "First, the Bank needs to be mindful of the possibility that movements in the terms of trade may affect the relationship between core and total CPI inflation.", "Recall that globalization has led to lower prices for many manufactured goods and higher prices for many commodities, particularly energy products.", "While both of these groups are represented in the total consumer price index, many energy prices are excluded from our core measure of inflation because of their volatility.", "In the pursuit of our 2 per cent target for total CPI, we use our core measure as an operational guide because it has been a good gauge of the underlying trend of inflation and has been a better predictor of future changes in the total index than has total CPI itself.", "Forthcoming research at the Bank of Canada indicates that this relationship continues to hold in Canada, although it has diminished in many other countries.", "We will continue to monitor the stability of this relationship, and the Bank will also continue to look at a range of measures to assess the underlying trend of inflation.", "Considerable judgment must always be applied, and no one measure should be relied on exclusively.", "Second, globalization may affect the degree and speed of the pass-through of exchange rate movements to domestic prices.", "It is widely believed that globalization acts as a stabilizer that should dampen exchange rate pass-through because the increased competition faced by businesses will lead them to compress their margins to remain competitive and absorb rising costs.", "Eventually, however, local prices should adjust to exchange rate movements, if they persist.", "We may, in fact, be seeing this effect here in Canada, since some retailers in the automotive and book sectors have recently adjusted prices downwards in the face of greater competitive pressures stemming from the rise of the Canadian dollar.", "Third, globalization may have a conflicting influence on productivity.", "I have already mentioned how globalization promotes higher productivity by allowing firms to arrange their production processes in the most cost-effective ways.", "Again, however, the reality in Canada is more complex.", "The large swings in relative prices fed by globalization have sparked a reallocation of resources between sectors and regions.", "This reallocation can lead to a temporary slowing in productivity growth as the adjustments take place.", "This is particularly true in the natural resources sector, where investments typically have long lead times, where a substantial amount of labour has been absorbed, and where high commodity prices have encouraged the production of more marginal resources.", "These effects may be behind a portion of Canada's disappointing productivity record in recent years.", "Fourth, the impact of globalization on market interest rates is an area where economic theory and reality do not quite align.", "The increase in the effective labour supply in the global economy should have raised the return on investment, all other things being equal, and led to an increased demand for capital to employ this extra labour.", "This, in turn, would be expected to lead to higher interest rates.", "As I mentioned earlier, however, long-term interest rates around the world have fallen in recent years, partly because of the exchange rate policies of some emerging markets.", "There are several other possible explanations for this phenomenon, including the balance of private savings and investment in emerging-market economies, itself the product of the economic policies in these countries.", "See Bank of Canada, Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target -

notably of motor vehicles and books - have adjusted prices downwards in the face of greater competitive pressures stemming from the rise of the Canadian dollar.", "In the MPR Update, the Bank said that we expect this to be a one-off movement in prices, but there is a possibility that there could be greater and more persistent downward pressure on prices than we assumed.", "The Bank also identified the downside risk that the tightening in credit conditions could be greater and more protracted than assumed.", "As well, there could be a more prolonged slowdown in the U.S. economy, exerting a greater drag on Canadian GDP growth and inflation.", "These two risks are, of course, related.", "In line with our base-case projection and the associated risks, the Bank lowered the target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point on 22 January.", "This followed a similar reduction on 4 December, and brought the Bank's key policy rate to 4 per cent.", "In making the announcement in January, the Bank said that further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to return inflation to target over the medium term.", "As I said recently, the timing and degree of that stimulus will be determined at future fixed announcement dates, after we have conducted a thorough analysis of, and applied our judgment to, all information available to us at that time.", "Let me conclude with some brief thoughts about how policy-makers in general should approach the issue of globalization.", "There are tremendous benefits from embracing this integration of markets, but there are adjustment costs as well, in the form of exposing our economies to global competition and swings in relative prices.", "The challenge for policy-makers is to ensure that the benefits of globalization are maximized and widely shared.", "In general, this means making sure that policies do not frustrate marketbased adjustments, but rather are aimed at promoting flexibility in markets -
