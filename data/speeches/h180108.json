are all aware that the more financial channels are used, the more finances penetrate in the economy.", "Moreover, the increase in the use of financial channels contributes to enhancing financial inclusion, increasing the opportunities for savings and productive investments.", "Taking into account the benefits from the formal penetration of remittances in the economy and the insofar

barrier-less, and competitive market.", "In the last two years, the Bank of Albania has been engaging in concrete projects with the World Bank, related to remittances and financial inclusion.", "The first project consists in an assessment of the compliance with the \"General Principles for international remittance services\" designed by the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlement and a concrete action plan, with many stakeholders involved, to comply with those fields that need further improvement.", "Another noteworthy project is the Greenback of the World Bank dedicated to remittances, implemented in several countries across the world.", "This project comes now to Albania as a receiver of remittance and aims at enhancing the efficiencies in the market for remittances and raising the awareness and financial education, and has Bank of Albania's endorsement until its completion.", "The other project consists in assessing the compliance with the criteria set out in the framework of the \"Payment aspects of financial inclusion\".", "By complying with the criteria from the involved stakeholders, it aims to increase the number of households and enterprises (mainly
