in policies; and coordination in structural transformations.", "Glimpses of the Indian economy With only 2.3 per cent of the world's land area (seventh-largest country), India is the second most

Indian corporates).", "With the financing requirement of the current account deficit being modest, the rising profile of net capital flows has resulted in steady accretions to the foreign exchange reserves, which have more than doubled from US$ 76 billion at the end of March 2003 to around US$ 200 billion at the end March 2007.", "While the level of foreign exchange reserves is extremely modest
