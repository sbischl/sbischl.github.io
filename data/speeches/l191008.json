sectors (mainly forestry and fisheries) and (construction and manufacturing) also contributed to this growth.", "Performance in all key export commodities, with the exception of copra, were

"Meanwhile, government debt increased moderately and remained at around 11 percent of GDP.", "Turning to the outlook for the economy, CBSI projects the Solomon Islands economy to grow by 3.7 percent in 2019.", "This moderation in growth reflects the key assumption that forestry will finally decelerate as part of the government's new policy to achieve sustainability in the forestry sector.",

manufacturing and fisheries.", "Over the medium term, the economy is expected to grow by an average 4.5%.", "This is expected to come from positive spill-over from projects such as the submarine

forecast for the next four years is for an average growth of 4.5 percent.", "However, there are several issues with what would have been quite a positive outlook.", "Firstly, as I have discussed during previous annual report speeches, this rate of growth is far too slow and will not transform our economy.", "We have a rapidly growing population that will demand more resources and support.", "We need to address our high population growth.", "Secondly, the 1 percentage point increase to 4.5 percent (from 3.5 percent over the past five years) only reflects the major infrastructure projects that will take place in the next few years.", "Once they are completed, growth is expected to return to its normal trend.", "Thirdly, growth has only centred on a few commodities like logs and have been far from inclusive, meaning that people in the rural areas have not benefited from the positive spill overs of development or in pidgin \"Mefala rural pipol no lukim nomoa growth ya\".", "I will share some thoughts on possible policy directions that could and should be undertaken in the next couple of years.", "(a) Robust Growth To realistically grow the economy without overheating it, we should be growing at an average of 6% over the medium term.", "To achieve this, we should address structural issues in the economy, and appropriately invest in the growth areas that we can realistically develop and sustain.", "Now, Government has successfully made strides in some structural reform areas over the past couple of years, from the business and regulatory environments to communication and taxes which, are being implemented.", "Nonetheless, more needs to be done.", "To grow at 6 percent means it will only take us around 12 years to double growth.", "Such a growth also has to be inclusive, cross cutting and achievable.", "So how do we go about it?", "(b) Foundations for an inclusive and broad-based economy To illustrate this point, we could lay the foundations of a broad-based economy by putting more emphasis on agriculture and tourism (without disregarding the other sectors).", "Agriculture is an inclusive growth area because most people in our rural areas can participate and benefit from its positive spill overs.", "To revitalize the sector, we should seriously invest in: 1.", "Aside from the current stocks, we need to replenish the stock of our agricultural current commodities over the next three to four years.", "For cocoa, the country needs to boost output by an additional 3,000 metric tons per year.", "This means growing an additional 885

expected decline in logging.", "To boost copra and coconut oil production, we would need to plant nearly 2 million new coconut trees.", "c.

promising cash crops, such as kava, cassava and noni, and even delve into new ones like ginger and chilli.", "Enhance and properly resource the Ministry of Agriculture, and associated agencies such as CEMA to appropriately support farmers, while also liaising with development partners and programs such as PHARMA.", "With respect to tourism, this is a growth sector with cross cutting positive spill overs and can be a catalyst for infrastructure, employment, education, wholesale retail, transport and technology development.", "As such, Tourism Solomons' target of reaching 60,000 visitors by 2025 is achievable, if we invest in: 1.", "Around two medium size brand hotels in the country to act as an anchor for the growth of other tourism standard hotels.", "Better sea, air and land infrastructure

and properly resource the key stakeholders such as the Ministry of Tourism, and Tourism Solomons, in conjunction with other stakeholders to actively promote this sector.", "Now these are just some ways we could shape our economy as we see slowdowns in the forestry industry, and strive to diversify the economy.", "There are of course other important sectors such as fisheries and manufacturing, where due to time, we may discuss at another time.", "Finally, as we rethink about the future of our economy, I would like to encourage the new Government, stakeholders and our development partners to continue the discourse.", "The key question I would like to leave with us is, how can my institution, company, constituency and myself contribute to transforming the economy onto a more robust growth path?", "Because the plans and action today would lay the foundations for the prosperity of our future generations.", "And talking about our future generation, investing in our young people is critical.", "Not only in their education and health but also in creating employment opportunities for them.", "Greater priority should be accorded to investing in and developing our human capital so
