and to the future of our planet.", "For instance, the World Economic Forum concluded in its annual Top-10 list of the biggest risks in terms of impact, that no less than eight of those risks are linked to climate change, one way or another.", "That should not have been big news.", "The fundamental problem with climate change was described thus in the Stern Review in 2006: \"Climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen.\"", "This is because climate change is an economic externality, meaning that whoever causes the emission does not pay the full costs of the damage.", "Despite the significant political achievements, like the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol, global policy action still falls short of what is required.", "The withdrawal of the USA from climate action is of course detrimental.", "The EU is leading the global effort also in this field.", "Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has referred to \"the tragedy of the horizon\": the impact of climate change is felt far in the future, while the costs are immediate, and thus we lack the right incentives to fix the problem.", "Economists might talk about 'time inconsistency'.", "That compels us to ask some fundamental questions on policy.", "If carbon is the problem, why not just ban it or strictly limit its emission?", "The reason is that for the past couple of centuries, economic growth has also implied equivalent growth in the emissions of CO .", "And historically, economic growth has gone hand in hand with the increase in welfare.", "Thus, by limiting carbon emissions without any structural change we would also limit the welfare of our citizens.", "Instead, we need to figure out how to continue enabling our economies grow, while at the same time effectively cutting down our emissions.", "Some countries have already managed to weaken the link between economic growth and emissions, but for the future of our planet, the link needs to be cut across the world.", "The transition of our economies to sustainability requires a lot of capital.", "The European Commission has estimated that, in the EU, there is a gap of 180 billion euros a year in investments to support the transition.", "And every year when this gap is not closed, it accumulates.", "Let's call this the climate debt.", "And it needs to be paid back at some point.", "For us not to become over-indebted, we urgently need to start filling the gap.", "In the Commission's action plan, prudential regulation aims at providing incentives for green finance.", "This would imply e.g.", "that risk weights for green investments in banks' capital requirements would be lower -
