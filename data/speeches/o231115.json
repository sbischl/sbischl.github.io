they also help to explain why we have upgraded the outlook for growth over the coming year.", "Further ahead, growth is forecast to pick up gradually towards trend.", "This is expected to be driven by a pick-up in consumption growth as the pressures on households' budgets from inflation fade and household wealth is supported by higher prices in the established housing market.", "The very tight labour market conditions of the past year have begun to ease.", "Given below-trend growth, they are expected to continue doing so over the forecast period.", "A key margin of adjustment is expected to be a decline in average hours worked.", "This reflects a longer-run structural shift in the way the labour market adjusts during periods of slow growth.", "Employment is expected to grow throughout the forecast period, though for a time it is expected to grow more slowly than the working age population.", "The unemployment rate is forecast to increase to around 4% per cent in 2025.", "That is a smaller increase than in our August forecast due to the stronger-than-expected outlook for economic activity.", "Broader labour underutilisation rates are also expected to rise gradually as the labour market moves into balance.", "I will return to the topic of the labour market when discussing our full employment objective.", "Inflation is expected to ease, but more gradually than previously thought Inflation has been declining over the past year as the direct impacts of earlier supply shocks have faded.", "That decline is expected to continue as below- trend growth helps to bring demand and supply more into balance.", "However, we now expect this to be a more gradual process than we previously thought, due to the still-high level of domestic demand and strong labour and other cost pressures.", "Nevertheless, inflation is expected to be a little below 3 per cent at the end of 2025 (Graph 4).", "Trimmed Mean Inflation Forecast* 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 * Confidence intervals reflect RBA forecast errors since 1993, with the 70 per cent interval shown in dark blue and the 90 per cent interval shown in light blue.", "Much of the decline in inflation so far has been driven by lower goods price inflation, helped by the improvement in global supply chains and a decline in raw materials price inflation (Graph 5).", "We expect that this has a bit further to run, because the easing in global upstream costs continues to be passed through to final prices and demand growth continues to slow.", "A further easing in goods price inflation would also be consistent with what we've seen in other advanced economies.", "By contrast, domestically sourced inflation - in particular, services price inflation -- has been widespread and slow to decline.", "For example, the right- hand panel of Graph 5 shows that the prices of market services are rising briskly; the prices of these services, which cover around one-fifth of the CPI basket, are among the most sensitive to domestically generated inflationary pressures.", "More broadly, still-strong levels of demand have allowed businesses to pass on cost increases to customers.", "Business costs such as energy, rent and insurance have risen strongly, and labour costs have been pushed up by poor productivity outcomes.", "Wages growth has also picked up over the past year, but now appears to have broadly stabilised and is forecast to decline gradually over the next couple of years as labour market conditions ease.", "Our forecasts assume that productivity growth increases to around its pre-pandemic trend; on that basis, the outlook for nominal wages growth is broadly consistent with the inflation target.", "The next stage in bringing inflation back to target is likely to be more drawn out than the first.", "This has been the experience of some other advanced economies that have been a little ahead of Australia in this inflation cycle.", "The recent increase in fuel prices is also a timely reminder that upside surprises from supply shocks could affect headline inflation.", "All to say, the road ahead could be bumpy.", "One of the key risks is the possibility that high inflation today could lead households and businesses to expect high inflation in the future, putting upwards pressure on actual prices and wages.", "Encouragingly, measures of medium-term inflation expectations have generally remained consistent with the Bank's inflation target.", "But, if high inflation did become entrenched in people's expectations, it would be very costly to unwind, involving even higher interest rates and a larger rise in unemployment.", "The RBA's full employment objective I've so far said a lot about inflation, but less about the other part of our mandate - that is, maintaining full employment.", "This is an important objective.", "Being employed and being able to work the number of hours desired not only provides people with an income, but also gives them a sense of purpose and helps to foster mental and physical wellbeing.", "The costs of unemployment and underemployment also tend to be borne by certain groups within society, such as the young, and people on lower incomes and with less wealth.", "What is full employment in the context of setting monetary policy?", "The Governor recently spoke about what full employment means in the context of setting monetary policy, and how it complements the Australian Government's broader full employment objective as set out in its recent White Paper.", "For our purposes, full employment is 'the level of employment at which there is a balance between demand and supply in the labour market (and in the markets for goods and services) with inflation at the inflation target; this is the maximum level of employment that is consistent with our price stability mandate'.", "Monetary policy's two objectives - maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment - are closely intertwined.", "When demand for goods and services exceeds supply, product and labour markets will be tight and there will be upward pressure on inflation and wages growth.", "By contrast, when there is spare capacity in the economy, with supply exceeding demand, there will be downward pressure on inflation and wages growth.", "In considering the outlook for inflation, we assess the degree of balance in the markets for goods and services as well as in the labour market.", "But what I want to focus on here is the ways in which we assess labour market conditions against our objective of maintaining full employment.", "How do we assess where we are relative to full employment?", "In practice, full employment - or how close we are to full employment - is not something we can observe or measure directly.", "It cannot be comprehensively summarised by a single statistic or just one measure.", "It also changes over time as the structure of the economy evolves.", "Instead, we have to infer how close we are to full employment from what we can see happening in the labour market and the wider economy across a broad range of measures.", "So, how do we do this?", "Using statistical models to infer how much spare capacity there is in the labour market One approach taken by economists is to use statistical models to estimate what labour market outcomes would be consistent with full employment based on what we have seen in the past.", "Typically, the focus has been on estimating the rate of unemployment that puts neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation or labour cost growth, on the basis that this unemployment rate corresponds to both balance in the labour market and in the market for goods and services.", "By comparing this estimate to actual unemployment, we can get a sense of the tightness in the labour market - in effect, how close we are to full employment.", "A shortcoming of focusing on unemployment is that it provides only a partial picture of labour market spare capacity.", "In addition to people who are unemployed, there are many people who are employed but would like to work extra hours.", "This is known as 'underemployment'.", "In fact, in recent decades underemployment has grown in importance as a source of spare capacity, relative to the unemployment rate.", "Underlying that is a long-running trend increase in people working part-time - part-time workers are more likely to be underemployed than full-time workers.", "There has also been a related shift in the way the labour market adjusts to changes in labour demand.", "A greater share of the adjustment tends to happen through changes in hours worked, rather than headcount, than was the case a few decades ago.", "For that reason, we also look at a broader underutilisation rate, which captures the shortfall of hours worked due to both unemployment and underemployment (Graph 6).!\u00b0!", "We can apply the same statistical methods that we use for unemployment to estimate a broader underutilisation rate consistent with stable inflation.", "Model estimates - whether based on unemployment or underutilisation - are useful, but they are only a starting point for assessing labour market conditions.", "That is because these measures are estimated imprecisely, especially in real time.", "Graph 7 shows an illustrative range of central estimates from a selection of models.", "Importantly, this range does not capture the uncertainty around the estimate from each individual model, which is considerable.", "You can also see that the estimates change over time: over the past 20 years the estimated levels of unemployment and underutilisation consistent with full employment have drifted down in response to structural changes in the economy.", "Model Estimates of Full Employment* Per cent of labour force % Unemployment % 4 4 % Underutilisation % 6 6 4 2 a ss a GD eG GG GN GG A RO 1993 1999 2005 2011 2017 2023 * Blue swathe shows illustrative range of estimates from a selection of models;
