budget drawdown issues; and possible inequity in resource allocation at the local level.", "In this regard, greater policy dialogue and close coordination of relevant government agencies in terms of fiscal planning and budget execution, as well as program planning is a policy imperative.", "Needless to say that the road ahead requires a lot of work.", "Let us start today by making this event a fruitful one through the productive and meaningful exchange of ideas on the topic.", "In particular, our discussions shall revolve around the following: 1.", "The developments/issues encountered in the BBB program.", "Funding requirements for the continued and sustainable implementation of the BBB program.", "Impact of the BBB program in the short and medium-term on macroeconomic conditions, namely, inflation, current account, exchange rate, and growth output;
