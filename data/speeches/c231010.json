* These remarks were presented by Ivan Faiella, coordinator of the Climate Change and Sustainability Unit of the Bank of Italy.", "Due to the official protocol in force on September 26\", day of the celebration of the state funeral of President Emeritus Giorgio Napolitano and of national mourning, the author Paolo Angelini was unable to participate in the conference.", "For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) provides that the non-financial declaration (DNF) will be mandatory only for large non-financial companies (from 2024 if the company is listed and from 2025 if it is not) and for listed SMEs (from 2026).", "and industrialised countries reduce energy consumption, due to the changing demographic dynamics, the improvement of technologies, and the awareness in the general public of climate problems.", "* Moreover, it is indeed a gradual process, perhaps too slow compared to the Paris objectives.", "Nonetheless, such process is significantly affecting the markets of some products and it is increasingly dominating the strategic plans of companies and the world of industrial and academic research.", "Government orientations are also progressively changing, albeit with notable differences across jurisdictions.", "One can dispute the fairness of the efforts required from emerging economies, or the reluctance of some countries to seriously embrace the objectives settled in the Paris Agreement.", "One can also argue that the implemented changes are insufficient to achieve the objectives of containing temperatures or, conversely, that they are way too rapid, as they might end up putting entire production chains, economic growth and employment at risk.", "However, there is no doubt about the trajectory behind public policies.", "These changes in laws and behaviours affect all firms, regardless of their size.", "Those most attentive to sustainability issues have long since made significant changes to their business model and have defined industrial plans that contribute to the transition and create value.", "Two examples: nowadays investing in production of energy from renewable sources and in energy efficiency can reconcile mitigation and adaptation to climate change with profitability; other things being equal, products with low environmental impact tend to be more in demand.", "Finance is working on sustainability risks Financial companies have become attentive to the issue of sustainability for two main reasons.", "First, like all other businesses they react to pressure from legislation and customers.", "Secondly, they are taking steps to evaluate the possible effects of climate and environmental changes on the riskiness of their balance sheets.", "The stimulus comes from supervision, but also from accounting rules.", "The recent round tables held by the supervision with Italian financial intermediaries indicated that several initiatives are ongoing.", "Larger banks and asset management companies are modifying their models with the aim of evaluating how the sustainability characteristics of counterparties - in particular, physical and transition risk measures - impact on estimates of the key parameters of the credit process (loss given default and probability of default).", "This effort obviously concerns all counterparties, including SMEs.", "According to the latest Eurobarometer Survey, three quarters of EU citizens declare that climate change is a very serious problem;

it is still incomplete and lacking in some respects; it is evolving rapidly, and not always well coordinated.", "The combination of these factors creates understandable difficulties for economic operators, but also an important push towards change and innovation.", "Significant changes are expected with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), currently in the so-called \"trilogue\" phase.", "The new proposal promotes businesses' contribution to a form of development that is sustainable and respectful of human rights and the environment.", "In addition to larger non-financial companies, a portion of supervised intermediaries will also be subject to the new obligations, which will be added to the provisions contained in the current prudential regulation.", "From a synoptic reading of the texts of the trilogue some common important elements emerge, even if - obviously - they may undergo substantial changes in the ongoing negotiations.", "Firstly, all businesses of a certain size - financial and otherwise - will be required to develop and adopt transition plans.", "Secondly, financial intermediaries will be required to suspend - or not initiate - relationships with counterparties at risk of negative impacts on climate and the environment (except when doing so could substantially harm the counterparty).", "Thirdly, all companies subject to the legislation will be held legally For example those that, like the Bank of Italy, manage systems for assessing the creditworthiness of collateral accepted for monetary policy, or that have active portfolios of financial assets held for non-monetary policy related purposes.", "accountable for the impact on the environment and on human rights resulting from failure to comply with due diligence obligations; importantly, this accountability will extend to the relationships in their value chain.", "If approved in its current form, the CSDDD is set to have pervasive impacts on businesses and intermediaries.", "Here I will simply underline that, although unlisted SMEs will not be subject to the regulation directly, those working with large companies will be brought within its scope through the value chain mechanism.", "In other words, they will tend to be under the pressure from large client companies, which will ask them to improve their sustainability performance and provide reliable data in this regard.", "Once fully operational, the effects of such mechanism will be even greater: today around 200 Italian companies are required to publish a non-financial declaration, but with the transition to the CSRD in 2024 and the subsequent approval of the CSDDD, they will grow to several thousands.", "How to react to these changes?", "Faced with the enormity of the economic and social problems posed by climate change and the ongoing transition, a company may be tempted to postpone reflection and action.", "High uncertainty regarding technology and regulation, and perhaps the pressure of short-term difficulties (as, for example, an economic downturn or an increase in the cost of debt) may also suggest a wait-and-see approach.", "However, I believe there is now widespread awareness that this approach may end up worsening the problems.", "Progress can be achieved by breaking down the seemingly insoluble problem of transition into smaller and less intricate parts that can be then addressed by individual subjects - consumers, businesses, governments, researchers involved in the study of new technologies.", "The European legislation lays great importance on sustainability reporting, rightly considering it essential for correct decision-making.", "On this front, progress is possible.", "Companies need to start from a cost-benefit analysis and ask a series of questions.", "What are the sustainability profiles of the company, and how relevant are they (the issue of materiality)?", "Will the collection of reliable information on the relevant profiles facilitate the relationship with financial intermediaries, or the raising of risk capital?", "Will it give the company an advantage when competing for future orders?", "Will it allow a reasoned choice regarding investments in new machinery and production processes, in energy efficiency?", "Will it be instrumental in taking advantage of public incentives?", "Managers who do not ask similar questions today risks making poor strategic choices.", "Collecting such information can be expensive, but we have evidence that in some cases important data are already available to the company and may just need a systematic approach.", "Take for example the issue of catastrophe risks.", "As we have repeatedly emphasised,\u00b0 there is evidence that in about three-quarters of cases banks seem to be P.
