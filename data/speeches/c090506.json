there also needs to be a continued commitment to the financial inclusion objective.", "This becomes all the more vital given the more adverse implications of the crisis on the poor segments in the economy.", "Secondly, while the policies and regulation of financial inclusion are essential to ensure the soundness and sustainability of an inclusive financial system, of equal importance are the
