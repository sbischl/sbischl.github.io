between growth and stability?", "Theoretically, the answer would be to apply some kind of a 'Taylor Rule' by putting even weights on both output gap and inflation.", "However, for a small, open and developing economy the empirical experience may not be that simple.", "One issue would be how able are countries like ours to pursue independent monetary policies.", "An argument that I do advocate is that the Albanian economy is a relatively flexible economy, as it manages to bring inflation to normal levels in quite a short period of time.", "Rigidities, observed in some other economies, seem not to apply in the case of Albania.", "Here, I have in mind the long hiring and lay off procedures or the variety of rules related to the goods and services markets.", "Most importantly, the adoption of

this flexibility Albania has shown impressive results in terms of price stability.", "Inflation has been distinguished generally by lower rates relative to other transition economies.", "In the last five years, inflation has stabilized at moderate levels as measured both at the end and average period figures, though it sometimes diverges from the target due to unforeseen shocks and speculative factors that are mainly beyond the central bank's control.", "We will continue to aim inflation rates around the 3 percent level.", "However, several threats may prevent the bank from reaching the target while preserving growth.", "To begin with, the signalling power of monetary aggregates targeted by BoA may start to deteriorate.", "This might involve changes in the administrative prices and structural reforms in general, fiscal uncertainty issues, the impact of dollarisation on the effectiveness of monetary policy, the potential decrease in foreign remittances and its implication on exchange rate volatility, financial system development and stability etc.", "Also, what's more important, as the economy gets more and more formal we may start losing some of the flexibility seen so far, making it more and more difficult our task of keeping inflation down with little real costs.", "In face of this forthcoming developments, we are considering alternative regimes such as IT that could both transmit central bank signals better and are more suitable to keep a better balance between economic shocks and inflation.", "On top of theoretical benefits of an IT regime compared to the other regimes, (summarised in a series of paper by Mishkin et al.", "(1997, 2000, 2002)) such as broader information base it utilises, its relatively higher flexibility with regard to supply shocks, the fact that it is easily understood by the public, there is also the successful reference to regime shifts in other European transitioning and developing economies can be made, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Poland and Turkey.", "Bearing the above issues in mind the BoA retains that a switch to inflation targeting over the medium term will put us in a better position to strike the right balance between growth and stability.", "Accordingly, it has initiated steps to improve its governance structure and strengthen its analytical capacities, with technical assistance from the Fund.", "To this end an open forum took place at the end of last year where most of the issue regarding the implementation of inflation target were discussed by top experts all around the world.", "The main motivation for moving to the IT regime is the anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium to longer term while allowing some room to respond to shocks.", "I'm conscious that going to fully fledged Inflation Targeting is a process that requires hard work with several preconditions in place.", "Our forum clearly showed that it is not a one-off decision.", "It should be more a smooth process.", "This holds in particular for a transitioning country like Albania.", "Our country faces different challenges and virtues compared with developed countries."], "classifications": ["none",
