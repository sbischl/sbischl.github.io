a good precursor to today's presentation.", "While in Brooklyn, I also visited Brownsville, a neighborhood which underscores the reality of the challenges that many face and the fact that the economy is not improving for everyone.", "Later this year, I have similar trips planned to Puerto Rico, the Bronx and Albany.", "Obtaining on-the-ground intelligence is valuable and helps shape my view of the region, the economy and my outlook on policy.", "As you may know, the District we cover is quite diverse.", "It is not just a single regional economy, but rather many different local economies.", "Let me talk a bit about how the different parts of our region have been doing.", "Regional economic conditions Since our last briefing in November, the economic recovery has been variable across the region -

for example, construction workers, machine operators and administrative support personnel - that are hardest hit during recessions.", "Further, a feature of the Great Recession and indeed the prior two recessions, is that the middle-skill jobs that were lost don't all come back during the recoveries that follow.", "Instead, job opportunities have tended to shift toward higher- and lower-skilled workers.", "As we'll show, these same trends have played out in our region.", "While there's been a good number of both higher-skill and lower-skill jobs created in the region during the recovery, opportunities for middle-skilled workers have continued to shrink.", "I believe it is important for us to highlight these job trends and to understand their implications for our region.", "There have been significant and long-lasting changes to the nature of work.", "As a result, many middle-skilled workers displaced during the recession are likely to find that their old jobs will never come back.", "Furthermore, workers are increasingly facing higher skill requirements in order to land a good job.", "These dynamics in the labor market present a host of challenges for the region to address.", "However one thing is clear: workers will need more education, training and skills to take full advantage of the types of job opportunities being created in our region, as well as across the nation.", "So, it's important that we work together to find ways to help people in our region adapt to these changes.", "I will now ask Jaison Abel to provide an update of economic conditions in our region."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["middle-skilled jobs", "recovery", "New York City", "Puerto Rico", "employment", "jobs", "economy", "skills", "education", "training"]}
