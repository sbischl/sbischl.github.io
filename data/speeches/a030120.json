less activist budgetary policies and fewer global shocks - each account for 20% to 30% of cyclical damping since the early 1980s.", "Against this background of more moderate cyclical movements, I should like to \"zoom in\" on the current cyclical downturn in the Netherlands.", "Contrary to some allegations, this downturn is not very different from previous periods of cyclical decline -

a few quarters after the cyclical turning point.", "Added to this, the sharp increase in housing prices levelled off in 2001, and with it the boost it had given to consumer spending.", "This has had a negative impact on private consumption.", "Another remarkable feature of the current downturn is the fact that Dutch inflation has risen relatively strongly, not only compared to earlier business cycles, but also compared to other euro area countries.", "In all EMU countries, inflation was pushed up by rising oil and food prices and the decline in the exchange rate of the euro.", "In the Netherlands, however, this development was compounded by the unusually low rate of unemployment reached well before the cyclical peak in output.", "Labour market tightness resulted in strong wage increases, and hence in an acceleration of the Dutch inflation rate.", "Dutch prices have risen more sharply than elsewhere in Europe, and I do not have to tell this audience what that means for Dutch competitiveness.", "And although the difference in inflation between the Netherlands and the euro area has declined from 2.2 percentage points in January to 1.2 percentage point in November.", "This indicates that the rate of deterioration has come down.", "It does not mean that any lost ground has been regained.", "Analysing recent cyclical developments is not an art for art's sake.", "Understanding the nature of the downturn may contribute to more accurate economic projections.", "The ongoing adjustments in the Dutch business sector, like those elsewhere in the euro area, have not been completed.", "Thus far, the US economy has appeared the more resilient.", "Recovery on both sides of the Atlantic is therefore unlikely to be simultaneous.", "According to the latest figures, the US economy has already returned to 21\u20442 per cent growth over the past year, whereas the recovery in Europe which was expected for the second half of 2002, failed to materialise.", "Current expectations are that the European economy will only start to pick up in the course of 2003 -
