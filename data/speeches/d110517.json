could go on for some time.", "The Bank's view is that a large, sustained increase in demand (most notably in China) is the primary driver of this boom.", "With more than three-quarters of commodities

abruptly.", "Recent declines could reflect a re-rating of global growth prospects combined with some adjustments to positions of financial market participants.", "But these are fluctuations around high levels.", "The reorientation of production to Asia and the dramatic increases in its infrastructure spending have also fuelled an export boom of capital goods, which is supporting the recoveries in major economies.", "This is one reason why U.S. production has led domestic demand.", "These exports of capital goods have fed the hiring and, by extension, the consumption growth that has occurred.", "Going forward, Canada's exposure to emerging markets will be increasingly important.", "At this stage, it is largely derivative (gaining more from the price impact of commodities than from broader export sales).", "Higher commodity prices raise profits in the primary sector, which in turn stimulates production and investment in that sector, as well as greater spending more broadly on domestically produced goods and services.", "However, since only 10 per cent of Canada's exports go to emerging economies and our non-commodity export market share in the BRICS has been almost halved over the past decade, activity in Canada does not benefit to the same extent as in past commodity booms driven by U.S. growth.", "The current situation is more akin to a supply shock for our

differentials between emerging and advanced economies and the substantially underweight positions of most Canadian investors, the opportunities appear substantial.", "However, it will be a crowded field in the short term.", "Investors from advanced economies are substantially overweight in their home markets: advanced economies represent half of current global GDP, but their equity market capitalization is nearly three-quarters of the global capital market.", "A reallocation of 5 per cent of advanced-economy portfolios to emerging markets translates into a potential flow of $2 trillion, or 10 times portfolio equity flows to all emerging markets.", "Unlike Canada, which imported on average 8 per cent of GDP per year in the three decades before World War I, emerging markets are currently net capital exporters (Chart 6).", "In effect, there is a massive recycling operation under way: private capital flows from advanced to emerging economies are being more than offset by official outflows in the opposite direction.", "While emerging economies are having difficulties absorbing large private flows, advanced economies have often misallocated surges in yield-insensitive gross claims.", "In Canada, as elsewhere, large capital inflows will require vigilance from public authorities and private financial institutions.", "Financial history, particularly during times of large power shifts, is rife with examples of booms stoked by dumb money that turn good situations to bad.", "Moreover, the current dynamics could have important effects on the exchange rates of countries like Canada.", "With some countries managing their exchange rates and restricting capital inflows, pressure for U.S.-dollar depreciation is re-directed to freely floating currencies.", "As

between 8 and 11 per cent of GDP for the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain.", "Moreover, these forecasts assume that nominal interest rates will be roughly the same level as nominal growth rates.", "However, if markets begin to lose patience, higher rates will ensue and the required adjustment will be even larger.", "Canada is one of the few advanced economies on a path to avoid this outcome.", "However, despite this crucial advantage, we cannot fully insulate ourselves from the spillovers from others.", "Fiscal slippage by some major countries may increase interest rates for all.", "Moreover, experience suggests that when debt exceeds 90 per cent of GDP (as it will for most of our trading partners), growth slows, with predictable consequences for our exports.", "In the extreme, if fiscal consolidation abroad is delayed too long, investors may even call into question the existence of a risk-free asset.", "This would have far-reaching consequences, including less-diversified portfolios, higher risk premia across asset classes and greater asset market volatility.", "The resulting higher borrowing costs for individuals and firms would have broad-based implications for capital allocation and economic growth.", "In the end, given these risks, all countries should follow the Toronto G-20 accord to halve their deficits by 2013 and stabilize their respective debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.", "Implications for monetary policy in Canada In this volatile world, the best contribution that monetary policy can make is to keep inflation low, stable and predictable.", "The outlook for inflation in Canada is importantly influenced by current manifestations of some of the longer-term trends I have mentioned.", "Following the depths of the crisis, Canadian domestic demand grew very strongly, supported by highly stimulative fiscal and monetary policy.", "Now, aggregate demand is rebalancing towards business investment and net exports and away from government and household spending.", "However, the relative weakness in the U.S. economy, our under-representation in emerging markets, and our competitiveness challenges will likely weigh on export performance for some time.", "While underlying inflation is relatively subdued, the Bank expects that sharp increases in energy prices (when combined with ongoing changes in provincial indirect taxes) will keep total CPI inflation above 3 per cent in the short term, as was the case in March, before it returns to the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2012.", "Core inflation is expected to rise to 2 per cent over the same period, as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed, labour compensation growth remains modest, productivity recovers and inflation expectations remain well anchored.", "Data received since the April decision have generally supported the Bank's near-term outlook.", "Recent inflation and employment have been modestly stronger; auto sales and retail purchases have been a touch weaker.", "Indicators have been consistent with continued, strong business investment.", "The possibility of greater momentum in household borrowing and spending in Canada represents an upside risk to inflation in Canada.", "The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could create even greater headwinds for our economy, putting additional downward pressure on inflation in Canada.", "The Bank's 1 per cent target for the overnight rate leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 percent inflation target in an environment of material excess supply in Canada.", "Any further reduction in monetary stimulus would need to be carefully considered.", "The lessons of the past century would serve us well in this one.", "As Barry Eichengreen observed, \"Global shifts have almost always fanned economic conflict, created problems for economic management, and heightened diplomatic tensions.", "\"14 Challenges for economic management can be addressed by economic flexibility and sound macro policy.", "Canada's fiscal strength and monetary policy credibility represent crucial advantages that must be preserved.", "Our commitment to openness should drive us not only to create new markets but also to help secure the new economic order.", "That is why we are investing so heavily in current G-20 efforts to develop a framework for open capital flows and reforms for more resilient financial systems.", "That is why we are working to help guide the multilateral cooperation and policy coordination required to support the global recovery.", "That is why we are trying to convince others to follow the lessons we learned in the last century, so that we can all realise the great promise of this one.", "This is how we can best fulfill Laurier's vision, expressed in his inaugural address to this Club, when he called for a century \"filled\" by Canada."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
