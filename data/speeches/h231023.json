lead to financial instability through complacency loop as explained earlier; and prolonged periods of depressed growth can keep prices in check, but they could also lead to financial instability.", "Second, periods of high inflation that are addressed by strong monetary policy tightening can deter financial stability if interest rate risks are not adequately factored in.", "It is, therefore,

offered for a limited period and were not open ended, but subject to achievement of certain financial and operational parameters.", "It may be noted that all these measures were nuanced, keeping in

addressing financial stability considerations simultaneously.", "The flexibility provided by a dual mandate under FIT of maintaining price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth, along with the provision of a tolerance band around the target rate, helped us to accommodate large supply side shocks, while focusing on immediate growth concerns during the pandemic.", "Subsequently, when the shock of Ukraine war struck in 2022 and there was a sudden surge in inflation, we quickly changed gears by prioritising inflation over growth and shifting the monetary policy
