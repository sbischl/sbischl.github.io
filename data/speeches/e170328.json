Brexit triumphed in the United Kingdom last June; and the new American government freely expresses its reservations about the European Union.", "In these times of turmoil, we mustn't lower the European flag.", "Let us remember the formidable progress that we have made since our two countries decided to share their destinies by signing the Treaty of Rome, along with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.", "Today, in Europe, we share three major economic assets: the single currency, the single market and our common social model.", "We have built them together and we can be proud of them.", "This will be my first point.", "For the future, European unity continues to be, in my view, the best answer to all the questions.", "And for that, the remarkable friendship between our two countries must continue to inspire us.", "As Chancellor Konrad Adenauer already stated in 1963: \"Imagine, if this friendship [between France and Germany] didn't exist, any attempt to create Europe would be doomed to fail from the outset.\"", "This will be my second point.", "What we currently share in Europe: our three economic strengths.", "Let me start by our shared successes.", "Today, in Europe, we have three major economic assets: the single currency, the single market and our common social model.", "First asset: It is a solid currency that is recognised worldwide.", "The great majority of the euro.", "euro area citizens are attached to it: 70% according to the latest Eurobarometer Survey .", "And contrary to certain claims, our monetary policy is not some Latin flight of fancy.", "It is very much in line with the German values that I fully share: independence, respect of the Treaties, price stability and a long-term approach.", "Monetary policy is decided collectively by the Governing Council, and we take the task entrusted to us of ensuring price stability very seriously.", "This means making sure that inflation is neither too high nor too low: our target is below, but close to 2% over the medium term.", "Our monetary policy has enabled us to prevent the mortal danger of deflation that has been threatening the euro area in recent times.", "Today, inflation is rising again in the euro area, as we had announced: we have moved from a fall of 0.2% in April 2016 to a rise of 2% last month, due somewhat exceptionally to energy prices.", "Second asset: we share a large single market that belongs collectively to the Member States of the European Union.", "This is a major step forward for European trade.", "It is no coincidence that single market access is at the centre of the Brexit debate.", "Naturally, we cannot anticipate the results of the forthcoming negotiations, but one principle of consistency must be observed: access to the single market must continue to be contingent on the strict observance of all of its rules.", "There can be no cherry picking or free-riding.", "And we must obviously maintain our common European trade policy if we wish to retain our clout in future trade negotiations at the global level.", "Third asset: our common in Europe.", "It is less widely discussed, but it is what fundamentally defines continental Europe, and it is what German and French society and public opinion share.", "Our social model combines a high level of public service, relatively low levels of inequality - much lower than in the United States - and a good intensity of social dialogue.", "And this has been achieved in a market economy.", "I would like to stress the extent to which this social market economy (Soziale Marktwirtschaft) is a response to the questions raised in the AngloSaxon world, rather than protectionism: Germany, like many other European countries, proves that economic success can go hand in hand with social welfare, and less inequality.", "We can be proud of these three assets that we have built together.", "But for the future, while some no longer seem to believe in the benefits of the European project, we can no longer afford to be complacent; we cannot simply rest on our laurels.", "In order to control our common destiny we need to build a better Europe.", "This would be a mistake if we want to take collective control of our destiny in this new world.", "But by a \"better\" Europe, less caught up in the detail, more focused on a few key priorities, and more efficient.", "To achieve this, Europe needs the energy of Germany and France, and of their remarkable friendship.", "I will now cite Chancellor Helmut Kohl: \"The Germans and French must together build the hard core of the European Union - a union that sees itself not merely as a common market, but as a community of values, a democracy based on freedom, the rule of law and the social responsibility of the State\".", "Naturally I won't talk to you this evening about the French election debate: I will simply say that as friends of France, you must not underestimate the strength of its institutions.", "I will talk to you even less about the German election debate.", "But I strongly believe that after these democratic elections, whatever the outcome, the governments of our two countries will have to confer to decide on a number of shared bilateral projects, and above all prepare a common initiative for Europe.", "Because for Germany and for France, the other country is certainly the best possible partner: there is no serious alternative, neither in the east nor the west for Germany, nor in the south for France.", "And because if our common initiative is not sufficient to reach a European decision - indeed there are other countries and the Commission around the table -, it is nonetheless a prerequisite: without the Franco-German engine, the European car will remain at a stand-still.", "The projects for a better Europe must be chosen with care and prioritised;
