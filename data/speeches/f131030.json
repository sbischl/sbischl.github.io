is required between the base branches and BC locations.", "This will provide timely support to BC outlets, ensure close supervision of BC operations and give them credibility and increase people's confidence in BC services.", "Hence, banks have been advised to plan for an increase in the proportion of branches that cover unbanked areas.", "Banks have also been advised to consider setting up Financial Inclusion Centres, which would act as centres exclusively focussing on customers serviced through BC's.", "To step up the opening of branches in rural areas, RBI has mandated banks to open at least 25 per cent of the branches in unbanked rural centres.", "To help facilitate in achieving this mandate, banks have been advised to open small intermediary brick and mortar structures between the base branch and the unbanked villages.", "The idea is to create an ecosystem for ensuring efficient delivery of services, efficiency in cash management, redressal of customer grievances and closer supervision of BC operations.", "To further encourage the banks in pursuing this mandate, banks have been advised to consider frontloading (prioritizing) the opening of branches in unbanked rural centres over a three year cycle coterminus with their FIPs.", "This is expected to facilitate quicker branch expansion in unbanked rural centres.", "Along with increasing brick and mortar presence
