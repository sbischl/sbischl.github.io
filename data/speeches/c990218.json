(2) those of the recent rise in long-term interest rates; and (3) the uncertainty in financial and economic developments abroad.", "To lead Japan's economy into a steady recovery, it is important to prepare an environment where firms and households can regain confidence in Japan's economic future by, for instance, promptly restoring the stability of the financial system.", "With regard to prices, reflecting the large output gap, domestic wholesale prices are on a downtrend, and corporate service prices are weakening.", "Consumer prices have increased above the previous year's level due to the rise in prices of perishables.", "Excluding this temporary effect, consumer prices basically remain weak.", "As for the outlook, although public investment is expected to increase, distinct narrowing in the output gap is hardly expected toward the first half of 1999, as private demand is likely to remain sluggish.", "Furthermore, the decline in wages and the appreciation of the yen since autumn 1998 are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on prices.", "Hence, prices are expected to remain on a downtrend.", "In the financial markets, the Japan premium and Euro-yen interest rates (both on three-month contracts) remain stable despite the approach of the fiscal year-end.", "This reflects the abatement of the market's anxiety about liquidity and credit risks of Japanese banks against the background of the Bank of Japan's maintenance of a decisive stance on easy monetary policy as well as the formulation of the framework to restore the stability of Japan's financial system.", "Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen again reflecting the market's concern over the prospective expansion of fiscal deficits.", "In the foreign exchange market, the trend has been toward a higher yen.", "Stock prices continue to be weak.", "Considering that these developments can be a hindrance to an economic recovery, their ensuing developments require close attention.", "With regard to corporate finance, credit demand for economic activities remains weak, as a result of the significant decrease in business fixed investment.", "Firms' moves to increase their on-hand liquidity in the face of difficult fund-raising conditions are gradually settling down.", "Although private banks have basically retained their cautious lending stance, they continue to actively utilize the credit guarantee system.", "As a result, the previously tightened credit conditions are easing somewhat.", "Nevertheless, private banks and capital market participants are still cautious of corporate credit risk, and thus firms with relatively low credit ratings remain under severe fund-raising conditions.", "The situation continues to warrant careful monitoring, particularly with regard to how corporate finance develops toward the end of the fiscal year."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "financial dominance", "fiscal dominance", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination"], "topics": ["Private demand", "Corporate finance", "Economic recovery", "Public investment", "Financial stability", "Prices", "Credit conditions", "Yen appreciation", "Fiscal deficits", "Monetary policy"]}
