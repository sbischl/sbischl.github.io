targeting is becoming increasingly popular amongst central banks.", "Countries that currently have some form of inflation target include Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.", "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) officially adopted an inflation target in 1993 with the stated objective of keeping underlying inflation between 2 and 3 per cent, on average, over the course of the business cycle (Grenville 1997).", "The merits of inflation targeting are well documented in the literature.", "Inflation targeting is said to impose discipline on central banks, promote policy transparency, and foster the credibility of the central bank.", "This serves to anchor private agents' inflation expectations, and can help to resolve the time inconsistency problems associated with monetary policy.", "For these reasons the central bank may be able to reduce inflation with less cost in terms of forgone output.", "In practice, inflation targets are accompanied by concern for output stability and perhaps interest-rate smoothing - in other words, the target is said to be flexible rather than strict.", "Strict inflation targeting may require large adjustments to the policy instrument.", "This is likely to induce extra volatility in output and interest rates, which can promote uncertainty and damage credibility.", "Flexible inflation targeting allows the central bank to maintain low, and relatively stable inflation, while promoting stability in product and financial markets.", "Earlier work on inflation targeting was based on a closed economy framework where the central bank adjusts its policy instrument (usually the short-term nominal interest rate), to impact upon demand which in turn affects inflation.", "More recent work by Svensson (1998) and Ball (1998) focuses on inflation targeting in an open economy, emphasising the importance of the exchange rate.", "Movements in the exchange rate occur in response to changes in interest rates, but also for speculative reasons.", "Changes in both interest rates, and the exchange rate, affect inflation indirectly via a lagged effect on demand.", "However, changes in the exchange rate also have a direct effect on the price of traded goods, and thus on aggregate inflation.", "Also, changes in the exchange rate may affect inflation expectations directly.", "In this paper, we develop a model of a small open economy with traded and non-traded sectors.", "We investigate the implications of aggregate inflation targeting compared with targeting inflation of non-traded goods and services.", "Our model provides a description of an open economy which takes the world price of traded goods as given.", "In contrast to previous work, we distinguish between the consequences of different types of shocks by presenting variances of key macroeconomic variables, conditional on the type of shock hitting the economy.", "The implications of inflation targeting in a small open economy are not as clear as in the case of a closed economy.", "For example, consider a shock that causes a persistent depreciation of the exchange rate which is not justified by fundamentals (such as a fall in the terms of trade).", "The immediate result is higher inflation in the traded goods sector.", "There will also be some inflationary pressure in the non-traded sector.", "Targeting aggregate inflation may involve substantial adjustment of the interest rate and subsequent volatility in output.", "One way of avoiding such an extreme outcome may be to target non-traded inflation.", "This would require less adjustment of the interest rate, and hence, less variability in output and non-traded inflation, at the cost of greater variability in the exchange rate and aggregate inflation.", "However, targeting non-traded inflation may produce undesirable outcomes when the economy is subject to shocks other than to the exchange rate.", "For example, in response to demand shocks, or shocks to non-traded inflation, a central bank with a non-traded inflation target is likely to restore equilibrium rapidly.", "This occurs through large adjustments in the interest rate, at the cost of greater volatility in the exchange rate and aggregate inflation.", "The paper is structured as follows.", "Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature and discusses issues associated with inflation targeting in an open economy.", "We maintain that in the context of a small open economy there is a fundamental distinction between aggregate inflation and inflation in the non-traded sector.", "Section 3 presents empirical evidence that aggregate inflation behaves differently to non-traded inflation.", "Against this background, Section 4 presents a theoretical model of a small open economy with traded and non-traded sectors, and a forward- looking exchange rate.", "The model is used to compare aggregate versus non-traded inflation targeting.", "Simulation results are presented in Section 5 for the simplest version of the model with backward-looking inflation expectations.", "Section 6 presents some extensions to the basic model, including forward-looking inflation expectations, gradual exchange rate pass-through and discretionary policy.", "Section 7 summarises the main findings of the paper.", "Inflation Targeting in an Open Economy Standard theoretical analysis of inflation targeting is based on a closed economy model.", "Aggregate demand depends negatively on the lag of the real interest rate.", "Aggregate supply is represented by a Phillips curve where inflation equals its expectation plus some adjustment for inflationary pressure associated with the output gap.", "The output gap is assumed to have a positive impact on inflation, often with a one-period lag.", "Thus a change in the interest rate is transmitted to inflation with a two-period lag via output.", "Given the control lag with which policy affects inflation, the central bank must adopt a procedure known as inflation forecast targeting (Svensson 1996).", "In the simplest models, under strict inflation targeting, policy is set based on a two-period ahead forecast of inflation so as to move towards the target within the minimum control lag.", "However, under flexible inflation targeting the inflation forecast horizon is longer than the minimum control lag, depending on the nature of the central bank's preferences.", "These preferences are reflected in an objective function that penalises deviations of inflation from target, and possibly deviations of output from potential, and may also reflect some preference for interest-rate smoothing.", "Recent contributions by Svensson (1998) and Ball (1998) extend models of inflation targeting to an open-economy setting.", "This requires explicit consideration of both the demand and exchange rate channels of monetary policy.", "Ball (1998) includes the indirect effect of exchange rates on inflation via the output gap, as well as the direct effect of the exchange rate on the domestic price of imported intermediate inputs.", "The direct effect implies that the central bank can target inflation with a one-period lag.", "Thus movements in the exchange rate have strong implications for the setting of interest rates.", "Ball shows that an economy subject to exchange rate fluctuations will be forced to make frequent adjustments to the interest rate in order to achieve a strict inflation target.", "This will generate volatility in output which may be unacceptable to the monetary authority.", "To avoid excessive variability in the economy, Ball suggests targeting a refined measure of inflation which abstracts from the direct, but temporary effects of changes in the exchange rate.", "Svensson (1998) presents an open-economy model where goods are either imported, or domestically produced.", "He assumes that the economy is small in the market for imported goods, but not in the world market for its own output.", "This justifies the distinction between CPI-inflation targeting, and targeting inflation of domestically produced goods.", "Strict CPI-inflation targeting relies on the direct exchange rate channel to stabilise inflation at a short horizon, and thus introduces substantial fluctuation in other variables.", "For this reason, Svensson recommends flexible CPI-inflation targeting which stabilises inflation and output at a longer horizon.", "The appropriate distinction for a open economy is that between aggregate inflation and inflation in the non-traded sector.", "Domestically produced goods are of two broad classes, traded or non-traded, the prices of which are determined by different factors.", "Traded goods prices are determined in world markets and converted into domestic currency prices at the prevailing exchange rate; non-traded goods prices are in large part determined by domestic conditions.", "In this paper we present a model of a small open economy with a traded and non-traded sector.", "The exchange rate is forward looking and responds instantly to shocks and unexpected changes in the path of the policy instrument.", "Inflation in the traded sector is determined by changes in the exchange rate.", "Given the interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate, monetary policy can impact upon the traded component of aggregate inflation rapidly due to the direct effect of the exchange rate.", "Non-traded inflation is affected indirectly via demand, and directly by the effect of policy on inflation expectations, and on the exchange rate.", "This is of relevance to the construction of a Monetary Conditions Index (MCI), and is discussed by Ball (1998).", "For an early discussion of the distinction between traded and non-traded goods see Salter (1959) and Swan (1960).", "Interestingly, Swan considers a small open-economy model in which policy-makers are concerned about internal price stability, making this early work relevant to the discussion of inflation targeting.", "Overlaying our representation of the economy is the central bank's loss function which embodies preferences over inflation, output stability, and interest-rate smoothing.", "An aggregate inflation target may induce excessive volatility in the interest rate to offset exchange rate shocks.", "A non-traded inflation target may induce excessive volatility in the exchange rate when policy is adjusted to offset supply or demand shocks.", "Under such circumstances it may be appropriate to adopt a more flexible aggregate inflation target over a longer forecast horizon.", "Non-traded and Traded Inflation - Some Empirical Evidence We maintain throughout the paper that aggregate and non-traded inflation follow fundamentally different processes.", "This is confirmed by our analysis of Australian data.", "Dwyer, Kent and Pease (1994) have shown that the domestic currency price of traded goods depends on the world price and the exchange rate.", "This implies that the exchange rate plays a significant role in the determination of aggregate inflation, as we confirm below.", "In contrast, we show that the price of non-traded goods is determined primarily by domestic conditions, namely unit labour costs.", "For the purpose of empirical estimation we construct measures of both the aggregate and non-traded underlying CPI for the Australian economy.", "Disaggregated price series are used to construct measures of the underlying CPI for the traded and non-traded sectors.", "Price series are associated with either traded or non-traded sectors according to the classification scheme in Dwyer (1992).", "A sector is classified as traded if at least 10 per cent of production in that sector is exported or directly import competing.", "Remaining sectors are used to construct a measure of the non-traded CPI; further details are provided in Appendix A.", "Figure 1 shows our measures of underlying CPI inflation for both traded and non-traded goods and services.", "The published series for aggregate underlying CPI inflation is also shown.", "The first episode is that of the early 1980s wage-push during which non-traded inflation reached almost 14 per cent, while traded inflation remained steady at around 9 per cent.", "The second episode coincides with the strong depreciation of the Australian dollar in 1985/86.", "The depreciation led to a rapid increase in traded inflation to rates above non-traded inflation, which had also increased, but to a lesser extent.", "Towards the end of this episode, non-traded inflation turned down almost a year before traded inflation.", "The third episode begins in 1995 when non-traded inflation increased against the background of strong domestic conditions, while the exchange rate appreciation reduced traded inflation.", "Figure 2 compares underlying CPI inflation of traded goods and services with import price inflation.", "The volatility of import price inflation reflects rapid and complete first stage pass-through of the exchange rate to the price of imports (Dwyer, Kent and Pease 1994).", "In contrast, our measure of CPI inflation in the traded sector is less volatile.", "This is because our measure is based on final retail prices, and therefore, it incorporates a sizeable non-traded component due to the costs of bringing goods to market (Dwyer and Lam 1994).", "What we loosely refer to as traded inflation in our theoretical model, is in reality closer to import price inflation.", "While our measure of CPI inflation in the traded sector is not directly comparable with our theoretical definition, non-traded CPI inflation is consistent with our model.", "For this reason we focus our empirical analysis on the distinction between aggregate and non-traded CPI inflation.", "Following de Brouwer and Ericsson (1995), we adopt an error-correction framework in our estimation of Australian inflation.", "The model assumes a long-run relationship between the underlying CPI, unit labour costs and import prices.", "The mark-up of retail prices over the cost of production is determined in the short run by the output gap (see Appendix A for a further discussion).", "We estimate a model for both aggregate and non-traded inflation from September 1979 to December 1997.", "Results for parsimonious specifications are shown in Table 1, and indicate that a rise in unit labour costs and/or import prices will increase both measures of the CPI.", "The price of imports is equal to the free on board price of merchandise imports (excluding oil, computers and 'lumpy' items such as aircraft).", "In some respects it may appear to be more appropriate to distinguish between import price inflation and domestic inflation, rather than traded and non-traded inflation (Svensson 1998; Ball 1998).", "However, a small open economy takes the prices of both imports and exports as given, with the prices of domestically produced import substitutes also being closely linked to world markets.", "To the extent that export goods are consumed domestically, their prices will also be determined by world markets.", "A large proportion of Australian exports are either resource or rural based, and therefore are not directly relevant to measures of consumer price inflation.", "Also, Dwyer, Kent and Pease (1994) showed that prices of manufactured exports are determined according to a world market for manufactured goods, and therefore should move closely with the price of imports (which are themselves largely manufactures).", "The significance of the coefficients on the lagged level of underlying CPI indicates that cointegration exists.", "Homogeneity is not rejected in either model.", "Estimated long-run elasticities for aggregate and non-traded CPIs are shaded in Table 1.", "Import prices, and hence, the exchange rate, have a greater effect on the aggregate CPI with a long-run elasticity of 0.40.", "Unit labour costs have a greater effect on the non-traded CPI, with a long-run elasticity of 0.81, compared with 0.24 for import prices.", "Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests suggest that these variables are integrated of order one and that at least one cointegrating relationship exists.", "We do not present these results, however, similar findings are reported in de Brouwer and Ericsson (1995).", "We may expect that homogeneity should be rejected in this model if there is greater productivity growth in the traded sector relative to the non-traded sector.", "One way to address this problem would be to include a linear time trend to capture any productivity differential.", "Including a linear time trend did not alter our main findings.", "We also investigated the stability of these models by estimating over a rolling fixed window of 60 observations beginning in September 1974.", "Numbers in braces {} are p-values.", "consistent with increased openness of the economy.", "However, these models exhibit instability for sample periods beginning in the early 1980s, particularly in the case of aggregate inflation.", "The source of this instability is difficult to discern.", "In summary, our empirical results are consistent with the premise that aggregate inflation and non-traded inflation follow distinct processes.", "The exchange rate has a greater impact on aggregate inflation through its determination of traded goods prices, while prices in the non-traded sector depend more on domestic conditions.", "Theoretical Model In this section of the paper we present a stylised model of a small open economy with a traded and non-traded sector.", "Our goal is to investigate the behaviour of key variables when targeting aggregate inflation as opposed to non-traded inflation.", ".1 The Model We assume that traded and non-traded goods are produced and consumed in the domestic economy.", "The structure of the economy is described by five reduced form equations and three identities.", "An additional equation describes the central bank's objective function.", "The solution to the model is the path of the policy instrument, in this case the nominal interest rate, which minimises the objective function subject to the structure of the economy.", "(All variables are expressed as deviations from their long-run means and all coefficients are greater than, or equal to, zero.)", "Traded inflation We assume that the country is small (that is, a price taker on world markets) and that there is no non-traded component in the final price of traded goods.", "For simplicity we assume that the world price of traded goods is constant and that pass-through is complete and instantaneous.", "Hence: T where is the inflation rate of traded goods, e is the log of the nominal exchange rate (defined as the number of units of local currency per unit of foreign currency), and \u2206 is the first difference operator.", "In Section 6.2 of the paper we

way in which agents form expectations.", "Alternatively, it may reflect the existence of overlapping contracts (Taylor 1980).", "Second, we examine two special cases, where ** is the expectation of either non-traded inflation or aggregate inflation.", "Whereas firms care about the real product wage, workers care about the real consumption wage.", "More generally, there will be some bargaining between workers Although we discuss our specification of the non-traded Phillips curve, it is beyond the scope of this paper to derive it formally.", "It may be that price setting by firms follows a partial adjustment process as in Svensson (1998).", "For a discussion of how this can be incorporated into our model see Section 6.1.", "Taylor (1980) assumes that wages are the only source of nominal rigidity, while Calvo (1983) assumes that all nominal rigidities are in product markets.", "Svensson (1998) provides a structural aggregate supply equation for domestically produced goods based on nominal rigidities in product markets.", "We assume that when setting prices, non-traded firms have no regard for the relative price of non-traded to traded goods.", "However, this relative price does have a delayed impact through its effect on aggregate demand for non-traded goods.", "and firms, and \u03c0 ** might be some combination of expected aggregate inflation and expected non-traded inflation.", "Increases in the non-traded output gap cause higher non-traded inflation.", "Finally, non-traded inflation may also depend on the cost of traded intermediate inputs.", "Firms in the

same period that the shock hits.", "In Section 6.2, we address this problem by considering a model with gradual exchange rate pass-through over two periods.", "In this specification, we demonstrate that an inflationary supply shock leads to an immediate increase in aggregate inflation (the appreciation feeds more gradually into traded inflation and aggregate inflation is dominated by the higher inflation of non-traded goods).", "Even so, gradual pass-through of this type is still not sufficient to ensure a rise in inflation initially following a demand shock.", "The initial fall in inflation in response to inflationary demand shocks is also driven by another key assumption.", "Namely, we have assumed that the central bank observes and responds to shocks in the period they occur.", "In the period that an inflationary demand shock hits the economy, interest rates are increased and the exchange rate appreciates.", "This means that traded inflation falls instantly, whereas non-traded inflation rises in response to the demand shock with a one-period lag.", "This is why aggregate inflation falls initially with the shock.", "In reality there is likely to be a delay before the shock is observed and perhaps a further delay before policy responds, by which time the demand shock will have caused non-traded inflation to increase substantially.", "This would act to offset any fall in traded inflation (coming from an appreciation), and so aggregate inflation would always increase in response to an inflationary demand shock.", "The variances of the key variables are shown in Table 2 for Model A under both targeting regimes.", "We examine two different measures of variance.", "The first, we call the unconditional variance.", "The unconditional variance of a series is calculated by assuming that all three shocks are active.", "This provides a realistic summary of the expected behaviour of the economy if the relative sizes of the shocks are accurate.", "The second measure of variance we call the conditional variance, which provides a measure of how the economy responds when only one of the three shocks is active.", "This is a useful measure if there is little confidence in the relative size of the three shocks used when calculating the unconditional variances.", "We begin with a comparison of the unconditional variances across both regimes.", "These show that targeting non-traded inflation causes an increase in the volatility of all variables (other than non-traded inflation), especially the interest rate and exchange rate.", "However, this result may be misleading because it could be altered by increasing the size of exchange rate shocks relative to supply and demand shocks.", "This is made clear by a comparison of the conditional variances across the two targeting regimes.", "Given that the central bank has relatively little regard for volatility in the exchange rate when targeting non-traded inflation, it can move the interest rate further initially, and return the economy to equilibrium more rapidly.", "For these shocks, the variances of aggregate inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate are all higher under non-traded inflation targeting, while the variance of non-traded inflation is lower.", "The variance of output is lower under non-traded inflation targeting for a demand shock, but the opposite is true for a supply shock.", "The interest rate response is greater for demand and supply shocks under non-traded inflation targeting compared with aggregate inflation targeting.", "The opposite is true for a shock to the exchange rate.", "A shock to the exchange rate has less effect on non-traded inflation and so there is less need to offset this shock with changes in the interest rate.", "Accordingly, when targeting non-traded inflation, the conditional variances of non-traded inflation, output, interest rates and the relative price are all lower for an exchange rate shock, while the variance of aggregate inflation and the exchange rate are higher.", "In summary, neither aggregate inflation targeting nor non-traded inflation targeting produce consistently lower volatility in both product and financial markets across all types of shocks.", "This is true even though both regimes are flexible, with the same preference for output stability and interest rate smoothing.", "Policy under aggregate inflation targeting is more activist in the case of an exchange rate shock.", "This reduces the volatility of the exchange rate and aggregate inflation at the cost of greater volatility of the interest rate, output and non-traded inflation.", "In contrast, under non-traded inflation targeting policy is more activist in the case of supply and demand shocks.", "This reduces the volatility of non-traded inflation, at the cost of greater volatility in the interest rate, the exchange rate and aggregate inflation.", "These broad results are quite general and should hold for alternative model specifications and a range of parameter values, so long as three key assumptions are not violated.", "First, that the direct exchange rate channel has a more rapid effect on inflation than the aggregate demand channel.", "Second, that changes in the exchange rate have a greater impact on aggregate inflation over the short-term compared with non-traded inflation.", "Third that changes in the interest rate have a contemporaneous effect on the exchange rate.", "In the remainder of the paper we demonstrate that our main result is robust to alternative model specifications.", "It is worth mentioning that we investigated a variant of Model A, where was based on aggregate inflation.", "In this model, non-traded and aggregate inflation behave similarly.", "However, this result appears to be inconsistent with our empirical analysis, which demonstrated that non-traded and aggregate inflation move apart when there are significant changes to either the exchange rate or unit labour costs.", "Similar findings are likely in forward-looking models with based on aggregate inflation however, the solution to these models is not straightforward.", "Extensions to the Basic Model The main results from Section 5 are robust to alternative specifications.", "In what follows we adapt the model to include forward-looking inflation expectations, gradual exchange rate pass-through, and the case of discretionary policy.", ".1 Forward-looking Inflation Expectations Consider a model in which expectations are forward looking in product markets.", "It is also consistent with partially forward-looking expectations in product markets.", "As before, we focus on impulse response functions (Figure C1, Appendix C), and conditional variances (Table C2, Appendix C).", "The results for Model B are consistent with those of Model A. Namely, policy is more activist for exchange rate shocks when targeting aggregate inflation, and more activist under demand and supply shocks when targeting non-traded inflation.", "Forward-looking inflation expectations appear to make the job of the central bank easier, as implied by the lower expected value of the central bank's loss function in Model B compared with Model A (Table C5).", "This is consistent with de Brouwer and Ellis (1998).", "However, in our model this result is contingent on the relative size of each of the three shocks.", "A comparison of conditional variances shows that the result is largely driven by the supply shock - the conditional variances in response to a supply shock are generally lower (than in Model A) under both regimes when inflation expectations are forward looking.", "In contrast, conditional variances for exchange rate and demand shocks are generally higher when inflation expectations are forward looking.", "This is primarily due to the behaviour of the real interest rate under forward-looking expectations.", ".2 Gradual Exchange Rate Pass-through We extend Model B by incorporating gradual pass-through of the exchange rate into traded inflation.", "We assume that pass-through is complete within two periods.", "With gradual exchange rate pass-through, a positive supply shock increases inflation under both targeting regimes.", "The demand shock still reduces aggregate inflation initially, but to a lesser extent than in the case where pass-through is instantaneous.", "Even more gradual pass-through, perhaps even with a delay in pass-through, would be likely to reduce this initial fall in inflation in response to an inflationary demand shock.", "However, as we discussed in Section 5, this initial fall in aggregate inflation is in part caused by our assumption that the central bank observes and responds to the shock in the same period at it occurs; before the demand shock has led to a rise in non-traded inflation, and hence, in aggregate inflation.", "For an inflationary exchange rate shock, the real interest rate rises by less than the nominal rate when expectations are backward looking.", "Hence, the nominal interest rate can be increased further to offset the rise in the risk premium, without producing as large a rise in real rates and, hence, output does not fall as far.", "In contrast, for an inflationary demand shock, the real interest rate rises by more when inflation expectations are backward looking; this is because the large appreciation actually reduces inflation initially.", "We altered the way in which the output gap enters the non-traded Phillips curve so that the aggregate demand channel can have an effect on inflation while the effect of exchange rate changes are still passing through to traded inflation.", "Not surprisingly, the expected value of the central bank's loss function (Table C5) is considerably lower in Model C than either of the previous models, particularly in the case of aggregate inflation targeting.", ".3 Discretionary Solution Thus far we have restricted our attention to the commitment solution.", "In models with forward-looking variables, there is generally a difference between commitment and discretionary solutions.", "In the case of commitment, the optimal interest rate today depends on the current value of forward-looking variables, which in turn depend on the expected future path of interest rates.", "However, under the discretionary solution the central bank can re-optimise every period and hence, cannot commit to the future path of interest rates.", "Because of this, the optimal interest rate at time t will depend only on the value of predetermined variables, and not on the value of forward-looking variables.", "That is: t t where F is an endogenously determined 1 n vector.", "The forward-looking variables will also be a linear function of the predetermined state variables: t t where C is an endogenously determined n n matrix.", "The solution technique is described in Backus and Driffill (1986) and Svensson (1994, 1998).", "Results for the discretionary solution to Model C are provided in Figure C3 and Table C4.", "Discretionary policy does not alter the main findings of the paper.", "Policy is more activist under aggregate inflation targeting for exchange rate shocks, and more activist under non-traded inflation targeting for supply and demand shocks.", "Conclusion This paper analyses inflation targeting in a small open economy.", "In line with more recent literature we emphasise the importance of the exchange rate channel, in conjunction with the conventional aggregate demand channel.", "Transmission of policy via the exchange rate works with greater speed, reducing the control lag with which the central bank is able to achieve its inflation target.", "However, targeting inflation at a shorter horizon may induce considerable volatility in both output and interest rates.", "To investigate these issues more thoroughly, we developed a model for an open economy that produces traded and non-traded goods.", "We argue that this distinction is the relevant one for a small open economy, such as Australia, and is consistent with empirical evidence.", "We compared the behaviour of relevant macroeconomic variables under two regimes - aggregate inflation targeting and non-traded inflation targeting.", "A feature specific to our analysis is our ability to isolate the impact of different shocks.", "In line with Svensson (1998), we present unconditional variances calculated based on the combination of all shocks hitting the economy.", "However, we also present the variance of key variables, conditional on individual shocks to the exchange rate, non-traded inflation and demand.", "This provides valuable information, particularly in the case where the relative size of different shocks is uncertain (that is, the average size of exchange rate shocks relative to supply and demand shocks).", "Compared with aggregate inflation targeting, targeting non-traded inflation allows the central bank to tolerate more extreme movements in the exchange rate.", "For an exchange rate shock, targeting aggregate inflation implies a larger interest rate response.", "This reduces the volatility of the exchange rate, at the cost of greater variability in output and non-traded inflation.", "In contrast, the policy response to supply or demand shocks is greater in the case of non-traded inflation targeting.", "This allows non-traded inflation and output to return to equilibrium more rapidly, at the cost of greater variability in both the exchange rate and aggregate inflation.", "Our results are robust to alternative specifications of the basic model.", "We examined models with forward-looking inflation expectations, and gradual exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices of traded goods.", "Also, we considered the case of discretionary policy where the central bank is unable to pre-commit to the path of its instrument.", "These variations did not alter the main findings of the paper.", "We are unable to provide an answer as to whether aggregate inflation targeting is strictly preferable to non-traded inflation targeting.", "We have considered an institutional framework in which the central bank sets policy according to either one of two simple objective functions.", "However, it is plausible that society has preferences for avoiding excessive volatility in product and financial markets which are not adequately captured by either of these simple objective functions.", "Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to formally model social preferences, we could imagine that if we had an explicit form for the social welfare function then we would be able to evaluate whether or not aggregate inflation targeting is preferable to non-traded inflation targeting.", "In this paper we have demonstrated that the result of this comparison will depend not only on the exact form of the social welfare function, but also on the nature, and relative size of the shocks hitting the economy.", "An inflation target with a more medium-term perspective would be one way of avoiding the extreme outcomes that can be associated with standard flexible aggregate and non-traded inflation targeting regimes (that is, with some preference for output stability and interest rate smoothing).", "In the case of an exchange rate shock, aggregate inflation would be allowed to move away from target in the short term, thereby lessening the need to generate volatility in non-traded inflation, output and interest rates.", "In the case of a supply shock (that is, a shock to non-traded inflation), the return to target could be more gradual, thereby avoiding extreme movements in interest rates and the exchange rate.", "The same is true of a demand shock.", "A goal of price stability over the medium term may appear to undo some of the benefits of having a more narrowly defined inflation objective for the central bank.", "However, there is likely to be a trade-off here; if the objective is too restrictive and creates excessive volatility in either financial or product markets, then the credibility of the regime will no doubt suffer.", "Appendix A: Data Real gross domestic product, GDP(P)
