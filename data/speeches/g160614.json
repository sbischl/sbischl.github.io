e.g., highly diversified exports and external markets, strong regional bias, low level of investment by foreigners in government securities (4 percent in March 2016) and equities (22 percent in March 2016).", "In addition, more granular assessments by investors of the destination economies would support their differentiated investment decisions.", "There is a strong commitment to implement policies that sustain macroeconomic stability and to ensure availability of policy buffers to address adverse effects of global shocks.", "Nevertheless, the impact on Kenya of these external shocks is expected to be minimal due to the diversification of its export products and markets, and stable financial linkages.", "However, the shock of a potential U.K. exit from the European Union remains of great concern.", "Looking ahead, we expect that our level of foreign exchange reserves -
