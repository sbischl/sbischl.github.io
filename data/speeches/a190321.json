and that the range of access that users of cash currently enjoy in services should also persist when the products are digitised.", "Also, irrespective of whether consumers avail themselves of mobile payment services or traditional bank deposits, the ease of access and risk tailored customer due-diligence should be similar.", "One of the early outcomes was that the Central Bank was able to establish regulations to license nonbanks to provide electronic money services to the public.", "There are already two firms that have either provisionally or fully met the requirements for licensing.", "In addition, several existing money transmission businesses are in the process of developing digital payment solutions.", "On ease of access, streamlined customer due diligence standards were introduced in 2018 under revised AML Guidelines7 which simplify the identification and address verification requirements to establish deposit accounts and to access other services from financial institutions.", "It shifts more emphasis to the important transactions monitoring process after the accounts are established.", "Further, it limits enhanced due diligence processes to relationships which banks assess to be higher risk.", "For very low-value stored products the identification process need not be invoked.", "In this regard, forthcoming clarification to be issued to banks will also suppress practices that mandate proof of employment as a pre-requisite to open an account.", "Not all banks have converged to these new standards, but we are actively pursuing this transition.", "The next easing, which the Central Bank undertook was to remove Exchange Control restrictions from non-resident access to Bahamian dollar (B$) deposit facilities.", "Irrespective of their immigration or work permit status these persons can open and maintain B$ deposit accounts with balances of up to $50,000 without approval from the Central Bank.", "As part of the Get Money Smart financial literacy program, and working with commercial banks we are formulating a new public education campaign focused on these changes.", "The literacy campaign The guidelines (see: ), which apply to entities supervised by the Central Bank: banks, credit unions, MTBs and payment services providers.", "These have been issued under provision in the amended Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2018.", "In the AML Guidance Notes these would be accounts that carry $500 or less and for which the monthly reload capacity is $300 or less.", "Monitoring of transactions for AML purposes, still applies for all accounts which financial institutions maintain.", "Where higher risks are assessed supervised institutions may also invoked processes that go beyond identification, such as verification of sources of income or wealth.", "will also provide more education on cyber security, to increase public comfort and acceptance around the use of digital financial products.", "Near-Term Priorities There are necessary further reforms that the Central Bank will target in the near-term.", "\uf0b7 Under the Payment System Act, the Bank will propose new regulations to strengthen consumer protection, along evolving best international standards.", "These would apply to savings and checking accounts;
