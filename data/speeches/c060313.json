this is a positive development.", "It underscores the fact that the business of developing statistical information is not only for the CSO or the Central Bank but is a responsibility of all economic stakeholders.", "I call on trade associations and industry groups to follow the example.", "Let me again congratulate CMMB on this worthwhile initiative.", "You have established a new standard among private financial institutions in terms of the provision of timely and relevant information for decision making.", "Additional efforts like these would go a long way to strengthening the country's statistical infrastructure."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Statistical Data", "Capital Flows", "Central Bank", "Monetary Policy", "Economic Trends", "Private Sector", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Financial Markets", "Economic Indicators", "Information Technology"]}
