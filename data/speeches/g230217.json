{"sentences": ["SPEECH The euro area hiking cycle: an interim Dow Lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research London, 16 February 2023 It is an honour to deliver this year's Dow Lecture.", "Christopher Dow had a distinguished career as an applied macroeconomist, both in the United Kingdom (at the Bank of England, the Treasury and here at NIESR) and internationally (as OECD Chief Economist from 1963 to 1973).", "[ Moreover, he extensively analysed my topic today - the impact of interest rate movements on the financial system, the economy and inflation - including in the context of the cost-push inflation pressures of the 1970s and 1980s.", "[ While the current inflation environment is quite different in many respects - having been driven predominantly by extraordinary external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply bottlenecks and energy shocks - much can still be learned by re-visiting the analysis by Christopher Dow of the macrofinancial dynamics and policy challenges associated with cost-push inflation.", "My aim today is to provide an interim analysis of the ECB's current policy rate tightening cycle.", "[ I will first describe the projected impact of monetary policy in the range of macroeconomic models maintained by the ECB.", "Next, I will report on the accumulating evidence about the impact of the policy tightening cycle on the financial system, the economy and inflation.", "In view of the long and differential lags in the transmission of monetary policy, this evidence is necessarily partial and of an interim nature.", "Still, it is essential to monitor closely the incoming evidence, since the efficient calibration of monetary policy must take into account the feedback loops between monetary policy, the financial system, the economy and inflation.", "Beginning in December 2021, the ECB unwound its highly accommodative monetary policy stance in several phases.", "First, the pace of net asset purchases was reduced, including through the ending of net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in March 2022.", "Net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme further shifted down from April 2022 and concluded in June 2022.", "In July 2022, we began raising the ECB key interest rates.", "The \u20acSTR forward curve - the benchmark for key overnight lending in the euro area - began shifting up in December 2021, as markets began pricing in the start of ECB policy normalisation.", "This induced a tightening impulse even before we began raising actual policy rates.", "The speed and the scale of the back-to-back rate adjustments since July stand out in the history of the monetary union (Chart 1).", "By now, we have raised rates by a cumulative 300 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate - which, in the current conditions of ample excess liquidity, constitutes the main instrument for steering the monetary policy stance - to 2.5 per cent.", "Furthermore, we have also signalled that we intend to raise the deposit facility rate by another 50 basis points at our March meeting and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy.", "This evaluation will necessarily turn on two basic considerations: first, an updated assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook (both the modal path and the risks to this outlook) second, an updated assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance to make sure that inflation returns to our two per cent target in a timely manner.", "In turn, both parts of this assessment involve judgements on the impact of the monetary policy adjustments that have already occurred since December 2021.", "Changes in the key ECB policy rates (percentage point changes) Source: ECB.", "Note: The latest observation is for 8 February 2023.", "Calibrating changes in the policy stance and monitoring the transmission to the financial system, the economy and inflation presents policymakers with three challenges.", "The first is to produce a reasonable (counterfactual) forecast of where inflation would head without an adjustment in monetary policy.", "The second is to develop reasonable estimates of how an adjustment in monetary policy would alter that inflation trajectory.", "The third is to carefully monitor each step in this transmission from monetary policy to the economy and inflation, gathering evidence along the way on how this transmission conforms with past regularities or, if it does not, to better understand how and why the specific features of the current macrofinancial environment might alter the strength and speed of monetary policy transmission.", "It is worth pointing out that, regardless of the origin of an inflation shock, the working assumption is that monetary policy operates on the demand side, with rate hikes reducing inflation through the dampening impact of tighter financing conditions on the level of aggregate demand.", "Nevertheless, watching for heterogeneities in the transmission across sectors and analysing the potentially considerable and state-dependent lags in the transmission is essential and I will return to this point throughout this lecture.", "In this lecture, I will leave the question of forecasting aside and focus on the latter two points: how to form a view on the typical transmission regularities, and how to cross-check them against the incoming data along the way.", "Let me first review the set of models that ECB staff use to inform policy decisions and present the macroeconomic effects these assign to monetary policy.", "As the bulk of these effects on the economy and inflation are expected to materialise only over the coming two to three years, I will then go through a set of more timely signals that may be gathered along the way and that can act as checkpoints on the path of transmission.", "To date, these signals for the most part point to a strong and orderly transmission of the ECB's policy tightening to the relevant financial and real variables.", "But, especially since this transmission process is still unfolding, I will conclude with a set of open questions on the impact of the ongoing policy tightening that can only be settled conclusively at a more mature stage of the process.", "The impact of hiking in macroeconomic models At the ECB, we employ a suite of semi-structural, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) models to study the underlying transmission channels of monetary policy and to quantify the impact of changes to monetary policy on financial conditions, the economy and inflation.", "Drawing on a suite of models, rather than relying on a single framework, helps us draw more robust policy conclusions.", "It is inherently difficult to pin down causal relations in empirical macroeconomic models and this is reflected in the wide range of estimates of the impact of monetary policy impulses on macroeconomic variables.", "The level of uncertainty about the impact of monetary policy is arguably greater for the euro area than for other economies, in view of the structural changes associated with the formation of the monetary union in 1999.", "Given this high uncertainty across models, we employ different classes of models, supplement the main models with satellite models, and add various other sources of information.", "Let me now turn to some of the main models that we use and discuss how these differ in terms of their design.", "The ECB-BASE model, which is similar in structure to the US Federal Reserve's FRB/US model, is a large-scale semi-structural model that is used primarily for forecasting and policy simulations.", "[ This type of model is designed to strike a balance between having strong theoretical foundations embedded in its steady-state properties and being flexible enough to be useful for a vast range of policy simulations.", "In particular, the semi-structural approach typically relies on a series of reduced-form equations that govern the relations among the key macroeconomic variables and allow flexibility to match the empirical data.", "In addition, several structural DSGE models are regularly used in our internal quantitative policy analysis.", "In particular, the extended version of the New Area-Wide Model (NAWM II) is a fully micro-founded model that incorporates explicit intertemporal substitution via a forward-looking Euler equation for optimising households, a financial accelerator mechanism linking bank lending to the net worth of firms, interestsensitive investment decisions of households and firms, and an exchange rate channel.", "[ Most recently, the MMR model has been developed, which is a DSGE model sharing many similarities with the NAWM II, but which additionally estimates the degree of attention to central bank communication, thereby dampening the forward guidance puzzle encountered in standard DSGE models, and accounts for a timevarying neutral interest rate in line with the trend visible in the data over the last decades.", "[ Our modelling toolkit also includes several Bayesian VAR (BVAR) models.", "[ This class of models is regularly used for forecasting and policy analysis in major central banks and international institutions.", "[ Due to their ability to capture the inertial behaviour of inflation and the persistence in aggregate variables, BVAR models provide a useful benchmark to evaluate structural and semi-structural models both in terms of their forecasting performance and for what concerns the monetary policy transmission mechanism.", "[ In general, DSGE models (NAWM II and MMR) and BVAR models display a stronger impact of monetary policy on the economy than semi-structural models (ECB-BASE).", "[ There are two main reasons for this.", "First, the identification of monetary policy shocks is typically clearer in structural models (either DSGE or structural VAR models), allowing for a narrower causal interpretation of the effects of monetary policy.", "This is important, since reduced-form estimates of the relations between interest rates, economic activity and inflation are plagued by the reverse causality syndrome by which, especially if demand shocks predominate, an increase in interest rates is most likely if economic activity is projected to be strong and inflation to be high.", "This gives rise to time-series correlation patterns by which any causal dampening impact of monetary policy on activity levels and inflation can be obscured in the data by its proximity to the strong activity and inflation data that actually triggered the policy tightening.", "In contrast, a structural approach in which the causal impact of monetary policy can be identified should, in principle, uncover the impact of policy tightening on activity and inflation.", "Second, the micro-foundations of the optimisation decisions that form the key foundations of these structural models, and the use of model-consistent expectations, lead to more forward-looking behaviour of economic agents compared to other models, and this in turn strengthens the expectations channel of interest rate policy.", "This explains the stronger initial impact of monetary policy compared to other types of models.", "The left and middle panels of Chart 2 show the impact of a policy tightening of 100 basis points on inflation and GDP in these models.", "[ Chart 2 also shows that impact of policy tightening derived from the Basic Model Elasticities (BMEs) exercise conducted jointly by the Eurosystem.", "The BME exercise is a euro area aggregation of simulation results provided by national central banks: these simulations are based on smaller, country-specific models that compute impulse responses of endogenous variables to exogenous shocks, linearised around a specific baseline.", "All simulations are based on a tightening that has a relatively persistent effect on short-term rates.", "Conditional on a 1 percentage point change in the interest rate, on average inflation declines by around 0.3 percentage points and the output gap by 1 percentage point at the peaks of the respective impacts.", "[ However, the range of estimates is large: the impacts on inflation and output are larger in structural models (DSGE and BVAR) compared to the ECB-BASE model and the BMEs.", "[ Moreover, due to their forward-looking nature and amplification through financial channels, the effect is frontloaded in DSGE models compared to other models, since households and firms more quickly react to the expected declines in future activity and inflation associated with monetary policy tightening.", "In contrast, the muted initial response in the ECB-BASE model and the BMEs can in part be related to the strong backwardlooking expectations formation process in these models.", "[ These estimates imply that the models generate not only different scales of monetary policy impacts but also heterogeneous lags in the timing of the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and inflation.", "Differences in transmission lags of monetary policy across these models arise from the specific modelling frameworks.", "In empirical VARs, the persistence is generally driven by the estimated autoregressive processes, in addition to the identification assumptions which impose some ordering of the flow of causality.", "In DSGE models, inertia is built in via microfoundations, with frictions such as habit formation in consumption, sticky or backward-looking wage and price setting, and adjustment costs in investment.", "Finally, semi-structural models use a combination of these empirical auto-regressive processes and economic frictions.", "In addition to the lags associated with the slow and staggered adjustment of investment and consumption to changes in financial conditions, the full impact of policy rates on financial conditions is not immediate.", "In particular, fixed-rate loans and deposits provide some near-term insulation to changes in interest rates.", "However, as financial contracts expire, more and more firms and households face higher interest rates and the tightening of financial conditions is further amplified by the endogenous shortening of maturities in response to higher interest rates.", "This will be a recurring theme in this lecture, in particular when I turn to how the current tightening is being transmitted.", "Finally, our overall policy stance is also affected by our balance sheet polices.", "Our models suggest that reducing our asset portfolio by a normalised cumulative \u20ac500 billion reduction over 12 quarters contributes to lowering inflation by 0.15 percentage points and output by 0.2 percentage points (Chart 2, right panel).", "Macroeconomic impact of a 100 basis points monetary policy shock (left and middle panel), 12-quarter cumulative impact of a standardised \u20ac500 billion balance sheet reduction (right panel).", "(deviation of output in per cent; year-on-year percentage points) Sources: ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: Left and middle panels: This chart depicts the impulse responses of real output and inflation to a standard short-term interest rate shock (normalised to 100 basis points) for the ECB-BASE model, the New Area Wide Model II (NAWM-II), the MMR model, standard projection-based tools (BME) and a large BVAR model including both macro and financial variables.", "Output gap refers to the output gap as a percentage of potential or steady state GDP.", "Inflation is in year-on-year percentage change.", "All responses refer to deviation from the baseline in percentage points.", "For BMEs the latest observation is for Q16, for all other models Q20.", "Right panel: The bars display a cumulative impact on inflation and the output gap over three years of balance sheet reduction.", "The balance sheet reduction is assumed to start one quarter after announcement and to cumulate to \u20ac500 billion by the end of 12 quarters relative to baseline.", "The impact is an average of the estimates in the ECB-BASE, New Area Wide Model II (NAWM II), and MMR models.", "Tightening so far according to model estimates Our models indicate that the significant policy tightening that we initiated in December 2021 has had substantial effects on euro area financing conditions so far, while its transmission to real activity and inflation is also starting to materialise.", "In discussing the transmission of our policy stance through the lens of our models, it is important to account for all factors driving that transmission collectively, including interactions with other domestic and global shocks potentially shaping macroeconomic dynamics.", "These factors jointly shape the magnitude and timing of the transmission to the economy.", "To disentangle these effects, the impact of policy normalisation is estimated by first computing the policy contribution to changes in financial conditions and then using macro models to estimate the impact on the economy and inflation.", "Combining information from model-based analysis and market and survey-based information, we estimate that the tightening of monetary policy has contributed to an increase in short-term interest rates of 90 basis points in 2022, rising to around 300 basis points in 2023 and 2024, and 240 basis points in 2025, and to increases in long-term rates of around 130 basis points.", "[ This tightening is estimated to have already lowered inflation by around 0.2 percentage points in 2022 (Chart 3).", "[ ],[ The considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their impact on inflation, however, imply that most of the effects are only expected to materialise from 2023 onward.", "The impacts on GDP growth, however, occur much sooner across most models, with the peak effect expected this year.", "Inflation is estimated to be around 1.2 percentage points lower in 2023 and 1.8 percentage points lower in 2024 as a result of the tightening, while the negative impact on real GDP growth is estimated to be around 1.5 percentage points on average over the three years.", "These are sizeable effects.", "At one level, these estimates serve to underline the severe risks to the delivery of our medium-term target if monetary policy had been passive and had not reacted to the inflation shock.", "At another level, especially taking into account the wide range of estimates across the different models, material and persistent errors in the appropriate calibration of monetary policy pose two-sided risks to the delivery of our medium-term inflation target: insufficient tightening would result in inflation persistently above our target, while excessive tightening could see overshooting and a return to persistently below-target inflation.", "These alternative scenarios also entail substantially different profiles for the level of economic activity and, by extension, the labour market.", "[ Impact of policy tightening so far (year-on-year percentage points) Sources: ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: The charts show the impact of changes in short- and long-term interest rates due to policy normalisation since December 2021 computed in ECB-BASE, New Area Wide Model II (NAWM II), MMR model, standard projectionbased tools (BME), and a large scale BVAR model including both macro and financial variables The latest observations are for25 Nov 2021 and 23 Nov 2022.", "Model-based analysis also facilitates the building of a more detailed understanding of the transmission of policy rate hikes to different components of demand.", "For example, recent staff analysis employing the semi-structural ECB-BASE model shows that rate hikes may induce stronger investment declines if the initial level of the policy rate is particularly low, as was the case prior to the start of our hiking cycle in July 2022.", "[ ],[ This result is in line with standard asset price models based on the user cost of capital, which posit a non-linear, negative relation between the level of lending rates and asset prices.", "Hence, in the case of business and housing investment, lower interest rates lead to larger discounting effects on future returns (dividends and imputed rents), amplifying the impact of interest rate changes on current stock and house prices.", "In these simulations, shocks to lending rate spreads and risk-free rates entail a stronger reaction of both business and housing investment in the low-rate environment (0.6-0.7 percentage points and 0.4-0.5 percentage points, respectively) by 2024, compared to a scenario with higher initial levels of lending rates (Chart 4, solid bars).", "The model simulations confirm a role for state-dependence as obtained from nonlinear local projections models.", "[ However, relative to such an empirical exercise, the ECB-BASE model suggests the presence of small non-linearities, especially affecting business investment (Chart 4, dashed bars).", "Model estimates of impact of rising lending rates on private investment Business investment (left panel) and housing investment (right panel) (percentage deviation from baseline/steady-state level) Sources: ECB-BASE simulations and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: Left panelshows the response of business investment to an increase of 100 basis points in corporate rates sustained over the projection horizon.", "Right panel shows the response of housing investment to a n increase of 100 basis points in mortgage rates sustained over the projection horizon.", "Spread increases are simulated under exogenous monetary policy.", "The risk-free rate scenarios assume short- and long-term interest rates to increase by 100 basis points, without spread increases, and are allowed to trigger an exchange rate adjustment that amplifies the negative impact of rising rates.", "Finally, all model-based quantitative estimates are surrounded by significant uncertainty, inter alia because these models are calibrated to reflect historical regularities that may not apply to the prevailing conditions.", "Also, while the models provide a good estimate for the overall effects of policy changes on the economy and inflation, policy transmission usually unfolds in a heterogeneous manner, with the peak impact and duration of transmission varying substantially across sectors and jurisdictions.", "Consequently, the broad orientation delivered by the macroeconomic models needs to be complemented by a more granular set of analytical checkpoints that allow us to ascertain whether the responses to our policy measures are moving in the right direction and at the right pace.", "I now turn to this more granular and data-driven analysis.", "Tightening impact according to market and survey information In line with the sequence by which monetary policy passes through the transmission chain, I will start with the impact on short-term money market rate expectations.", "A first indicator is the extent to which moves of our policy rates influence money market conditions.", "The evidence suggests that the policy rate hiking that has occurred since July last year has been passed on almost entirely to short-term money market rates, with the transmission occurring relatively smoothly across market segments and jurisdictions.", "Moreover, the response of short-term money market rates has fed through to longer maturities.", "The \u20acSTR forward curve, which is derived from the overnight interest rate swap curve and reflects the market view on the path that the overnight interest rate will follow in the future, has shifted upwards significantly since December 2021 (Chart 5).", "\u20acSTR forward curve and Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) expectations on the deposit facility rate

DFR observations; Right panel: Maximum number of respondents is 41 for February 2023 SMA and 29 for December 2022 SMA.", "The Bloomberg meeting-to-meeting (M2M) forward rate depicts the market-based expectations for all future Governing Council meetings which are currently announced until February 2024.The latest observations for the left panel are February 2023.", "Whether adjusting for risk premia or not, forward rates today see a rate trajectory which, in line with our communication, rises above the range of estimates that can be considered neutral to the monetary policy stance.", "Conceptually, the neutral interest rate is the hypothetical level of the interest rate that, when all temporary shocks have faded out, can set the economy on a sustainable path of balanced growth with inflation durably at target.", "As actual rates move beyond that level, policy becomes restrictive - as is necessary when inflation is otherwise set to remain above the central bank's target for an extended period.", "That is, the monetary policy adjustment since December 2021 can be interpreted as having two elements.", "First, there has been an exit from an accommodative stance: this component can be viewed as essentially permanent (in the absence of a new anti-inflationary shock).", "This is reflected in the market pricing of the forward curve, which sees the policy rate settling around 2 per cent once inflation has stabilised at our target, rather than reverting to the low (indeed, negative) levels that were in place until last July.", "This longterm exit from the persistently low-rate regime reflects the reanchoring of long-term inflation expectations at our 2 per cent target and the market judgement that the anti-inflationary forces that were in place before the pandemic (such as significant deleveraging by both the private sector and the public sector after the 2008-12 financial crises and favourable global supply-side developments) will not return with the same force.", "Accordingly, a significant component of the rate tightening so far is essentially permanent in nature.", "While the associated reanchoring of inflation expectations means that the rise in real rates is less than the rise in nominal rates, the permanent nature of this component of the rate tightening amplifies its impact compared to a purely temporary increase in rates.", "Second, there is an adjustment component that reflects our monetary policy response to the current high inflation.", "It is fully priced (in line with our expressed policy intentions) that the main policy rate (the DFR) will reach 300 basis points in March, and it is priced to rise even higher subsequently.", "This component (going beyond the policy rate of around 200 basis points that the market expects to prevail over the long term) can be viewed as restrictive and further adds to the tightening of financial conditions, even if it is less persistent than the normalisation component of our policy adjustment.", "Sovereign bond yields, which play an important role as a key reference for bond pricing, have also shifted upwards and moved largely in lockstep with the OIS curve.", "The transmission of rate hikes to sovereign bond markets since the start of the hiking cycle since July has been orderly, supported to some extent by the ongoing flexible reinvestment of the pandemic emergency purchase programme, activated in early July 2022, as well as the addition of the transmission protection instrument to our toolkit in late July 2022.", "Finally, the euro exchange rate constitutes a key metric of financial conditions that is available at high frequency.", "It is also a material driver of economic activity and inflation through a range of channels.", "Reflecting an earlier and more demand-driven updrift in inflation, US monetary policy changed course earlier than in the euro area, which was then also reflected in a sustained euro depreciation against the US dollar, lasting until September of last year.", "But as the actual and prospective interest rate differentials across the two economies were reduced, the euro has reversed some of the previous depreciation, thus confirming the functioning of another important transmission channel for the current tightening cycle (Chart 6).", "EUR/USD, EUR and USD effective exchange rate (left scale: USD per EUR, right scale: index - 01/01/2018=100) Sources: ECB and ECB staff calculations.", "Notes: Nominal effective exchange rate for 41 trading partners.", "The latest observations are for 10 February

reflected in higher lending rates to firms and households.", "Yields on euro area bank bonds have increased by more than 300 basis points since December 2021.", "The higher funding costs for banks are being passed on to borrowers.", "For firms, the cost of borrowing from banks started trending up in early 2022 and has strongly accelerated since September, bringing it to around 3.4 per cent in December (Chart 7, left panel), while the overall cost of debt financing, which also includes the cost of issuing corporate bonds, stood at 3.7 per cent.", "For households, the cost of borrowing for house purchases has increased by more than 160 basis points over the course of 2022, to 2.9 per cent in December, while the rate on loans for consumption and other purposes has risen by more than 160

and net leverage.", "What can also be observed however - at least in some samples examined - is that the sensitivity of EDFs to net leverage also shifts upwards when debt servicing costs increase.", "This may suggest that an environment of elevated debt servicing costs might also translate into higher probabilities of default and thus potential increases in companies financing constraints.", "[ Moreover, firm financing structures have not only changed in relation to maturity structures, but also in terms of the relative role of different debt instruments.", "While firm financing remains predominantly bankbased in the euro area, bond financing has increased considerably over the last fifteen years (Chart 20).", "Prior to the onset of the ECB's monetary policy normalisation, the share of bonds had reached a peak of about 30 per cent in 2021.", "Increases in bond financing largely reflected credit supply restrictions: after the great financial crisis and during the ensuing sovereign

rate can decrease, since the higher duration of bonds insulates the stock of debt from rate changes.", "However, at the same time, the total sensitivity to movements of the long-term policy rate and of overall yield curve might increase, via new issuance.", "The differences in transmission, whereby firms using more bonds are more directly affected by changes in long-term rates rather than short-term rates, reflects this fact that the typical maturity of corporate bonds is higher than for loans.", "[ Firm financing via bond markets can be fragile in a context of policy normalisation and thereby can amplify de-risking (Chart 21).", "As the normalisation process of monetary policy started and rates increased across the whole term structure, bond issuance dried up during the course of 2022, thus translating into a decrease in the share of bonds relative to loan.", "Furthermore, firm-level data suggest that the ongoing monetary normalisation is not neutral with respect to the risk profile of bond issuers, as riskier firms have more vigorously reduced their share of new bonds since June 2022.", "Given the greater sensitivity of bond markets to risk over this period, the role of banks in financing the economy became more prominent.", "More recently, the rise in bank lending rates has narrowed the gap between the cost of bond and bank finance, with some high-grade issuers

also experienced stronger contractions of consumption following a tightening in monetary policy (Chart 23, right panel).", "[ A generalised increase in the share of flexible rates of mortgages could thus translate into an amplified monetary policy transmission mechanism to consumption.", "At the same time, the significant amount of excess savings amassed by euro area households during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart 24) will continue to act as a buffer for consumption during this period of high inflation and will exert downward pressure on the price of capital.", "Both effects could thus dampen the transmission of higher policy rates to the economy and inflation.", "However, support for higher demand may only be partial: first, a large share of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic accrued to the wealthiest households with a lower propensity to consume and, second, a substantial part of the excess savings is likely to be reabsorbed via weaker borrowing dynamics and - among lower-income households - to finance the price increases for essentials like food and heating.", "In this context, it is also important to keep in mind that euro area households generally have
