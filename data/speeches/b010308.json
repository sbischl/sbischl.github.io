for contracts maturing in December.", "The vertical axis shows that market participants have priced in a 10 per cent probability that oil prices will be below USD 18 per barrel in December 2001 and a 10 per cent probability that oil prices will be higher than USD 35.5 per barrel in December this year.", "This would suggest considerable uncertainty.", "The chart shows that high oil prices and petroleum production are generating large current account and budget surpluses, with an attendant increase in Norway's disposable income.", "The current account surplus came to about 14 per cent of GDP last year, which is one of the highest surpluses recorded in an OECD country in the post-war period.", "In addition, government budget surpluses have increased sharply and reached 14 1/2 per cent of GDP.", "The Government Petroleum Fund shall serve as a buffer against short-term fluctuations in oil revenues.", "As large portions of the revenues from oil activities accrue to the state, fluctuations in oil prices and oil revenues will primarily result in changes in allocations to the Petroleum Fund.", "Since all of the capital in the Petroleum Fund is invested abroad, such changes will in principle not influence the level of activity in the economy.", "This makes the Norwegian economy more robust to fluctuations in oil prices and thus less dependent on oil, even in the short run.", "Nevertheless, the mainland economy is not completely protected from fluctuations in the oil price.", "A fall in oil prices will influence petroleum investment and may thereby have a direct impact on employment in some industries.", "Household and business income expectations may also be affected.", "A shift in international developments may also have a direct effect on the Norwegian economy via financial markets.", "An international turnaround with a decline in equity prices could influence enterprises' possibilities for financing investment.", "Household wealth may also decrease.", "Norwegian households' direct ownership in enterprises is still smaller than in many other countries, which suggests that the effect on domestic demand via equity prices will be limited.", "Perhaps the most important transmission channel is the foreign exchange market.", "The experience of recent years shows that international financial market developments can have a short-term impact on the krone exchange rate.", "Heightened uncertainty and unrest in foreign exchange markets can lead to higher risk premia on small countries' currencies.", "Developments in 1998 are one example, when the krone came under growing pressure as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices, turbulence in international capital market in the wake of the Russian crisis and imbalances in the Norwegian economy.", "The long-term objective of monetary policy is to provide the Norwegian economy with a nominal anchor - domestic price stability, and thereby the basis for a stable krone.", "Nominal stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to economic growth and prosperity.", "A nominal anchor is also a necessary precondition for stable financial markets and property markets.", "High inflation and wide swings in the exchange rate impair the function of prices as an information vehicle.", "This leads to booms followed by busts and an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth.", "Inflation therefore poisons the economy.", "By linking movements in the krone to the euro, we have chosen to follow the same standard for nominal stability in the economy as set by the euro area countries.", "Since 1997, inflation has been higher in Norway than in the euro area.", "The difference partly reflects a period of strong growth in Norway, while the level of activity in Europe has been low.", "But the relatively high inflation rate in Norway cannot continue as this will undermine the basis for stability in the krone exchange rate and weaken confidence in monetary policy.", "Short-term capital inflows and outflows are probably the most important factor determining movements in the krone exchange rate from day to day, from week to week and from one quarter to the next.", "They are governed by expectations concerning future returns.", "Changes in expectations concerning the future value of the krone can trigger extensive capital movements.", "As a rule, Norges Bank does not intervene in foreign exchange markets with a view to influencing the krone exchange rate.", "The krone is floating, and the value of the krone fluctuates in periods by the same magnitude as exchange rates in other open economies.", "Nevertheless, the prevailing stability of the krone is largely a reflection of confidence that inflation in Norway will be kept at a low level.", "Our experience is that changes in the Norwegian interest rate level only have a predictable effect on the krone exchange rate when the change in interest rates also contributes to stabilising inflation.", "However, the relationship between interest rates and price and cost developments is uncertain.", "The setting of interest rates thus requires the use of professional judgement and discretion.", "The basis for exercising discretion is subject to limitations, however.", "Should any doubt arise as to whether the interest rate is oriented towards nominal stability, this would trigger substantial capital movements.", "Interaction with income formation A precondition for a stable krone exchange rate against European currencies is that price and cost inflation in Norway must over time not exceed the corresponding aim for inflation of the European Central Bank (ECB).", "The ECB orients monetary policy to maintain price stability, which has been defined as inflation of less than 2 per cent.", "In recent years, cost inflation in the euro area countries and among trading partners has been relatively low.", "Growth in labour costs in Norway has been roughly 11 percentage points higher than in the euro area and 10 percentage points higher than among trading partners for the past three years.", "A number of other small, open economies have recorded a decline in unemployment and lower growth in labour costs than Norway.", "In Sweden, unemployment has shown a substantial decrease over the past five years and wage growth is below 4 per cent.", "Three-year wage agreements are now being concluded, underpinning the basis for low cost inflation.", "In the Netherlands, unemployment has fallen to a very low level.", "Wage growth has picked up, but is lower than in Norway.", "In Denmark, unemployment has come down without an increase in wage growth.", "In Finland, unemployment has fallen sharply from the high level that took hold in the 1990s, and wage growth has slowed.", "In the euro area, unemployment has dropped without an increase in wage growth.", "In Norway, the high growth in labour costs may be a source of rising unemployment.", "Interaction with fiscal policy It is important that the annual budgets are based on a long-term strategy that takes into account possible fluctuations in oil revenues from one year to the next.", "With large and, to some extent, varying budget revenues, the basis for determining central government expenditure and taxes from one year to the next may easily be impaired.", "If budget spending is allowed to vary in step with oil prices, the Norwegian economy may experience abrupt shifts and instability.", "Changes in oil prices may then quickly influence wage and price expectations, the exchange rate and long-term rates.", "In addition, short-term rates would have to be changed frequently and sharply.", "In recent years, central government real underlying spending growth has accelerated somewhat.", "In 2000 and 2001, spending growth has been higher than 2 per cent, which is higher than normal growth in the mainland economy.", "At the same time, direct and indirect taxes have increased.", "Fiscal policy has thus had a virtually neutral effect on domestic demand for two years while wage growth has been substantially higher than in other countries.", "A possible interpretation of this development is that it is more demanding to use the government budget to dampen cyclical fluctuations during an upturn than during a downturn.", "The willingness and ability to pursue a counter-cyclical policy may in itself be cyclical.", "Another interpretation is that a neutral fiscal stance this year, with a strong increase in government financial wealth, is a balanced approach to using the budget to stabilise the economy while phasing in an increase in financial income in the economy.", "The Norwegian economy is fragile and vulnerable.", "As long as oil prices are high, the Norwegian economy is fairly sheltered.", "Many central banks are now reducing their key rates.", "As our economy is affected to a lesser extent, the differential between short rates in Norway and abroad may widen.", "Thank you
