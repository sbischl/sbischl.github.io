Annual Awards, our special evening to celebrate and recognise the best from this important sector of our economy.", "Introductory Comments Today has been a long day for some of us who came together

economic empowerment through income generating activities.", "Microfinance is a sector that has a lot of potential for creating new jobs and boosting economic activity and, in turn, contributing to economic growth in the country.", "It involves among other things, extending loans, some of them as low as fifty dollars, so that people can start their own small businesses and generate income for their families.", "Microfinance, when done well, has the ability to empower people.", "When our most vulnerable are empowered with financial support to take care of their family, they can pay for the

State, but it also surely must bring a sense of pride to our people.", "I mentioned that it is important that microfinance needs to be done well.", "It is not just about giving out small loans and leaving the recipients to get on with whatever it is they are doing.", "It is about also providing the necessary support structures and skills development so that the people are able to sustain their

children's generation came out of school or university with the sole aim of finding a job and working for someone else.", "I would love to see my grandchildren, the next generation, leaving school with an alternative mindset and that is the ability and desire (if they so wish) to establish their own small businesses.", "We don't need to look far in Fiji to see how a small or even micro business can blossom through hard work over the years to become large successful companies employing many of our citizens.", "Pure Fiji Limited is a classic case of such a business.", "I recall Gaetane Austin years ago telling me that they started from her kitchen in Beach Road, Laucala Bay, and look where the company is now: Pure Fiji is not only a household name in Fiji, but also an internationally renowned brand.", "I therefore see it as our responsibility to nurture this sector and help it grow.", "Government Support Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been extremely encouraging to note the growing support by Government for our MSME sector.", "Several years ago the State set aside funds with the Reserve Bank to establish a credit guarantee scheme covering loans by financial institutions to eligible small and medium businesses.", "Interest charged on these loans must not exceed 10 percent per annum.", "To date more than 1,040 loans valued at just over $62 million have been registered under the scheme.", "I am pleased to say that there have been only two calls on the guarantee in the last 3 years.", "This year Government also initiated a Micro and Small Business Grant Facility to provide financial and capital assistance to not only existing businesses but also to those wanting to start a business.", "The intention is to help micro-businesses with seed capital or additional capital to grow and succeed.", "Since the set-up of the facility, we understand that more than 2,100 micro-entrepreneurs have benefited, with grants up to a maximum of $1,000 each.", "This is a huge
