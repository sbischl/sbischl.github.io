infrastructure deficit is in critical sectors such as energy, transportation, health, water, sewerage, and telecommunications, and is a significant drawback to the continent's economic performance.", "Vision 2030, Kenya's development blueprint, gives prominence to infrastructure development as a key driver of long-term growth.", "In recognition of the important role the private sector can play, the Government is committed to creating an enabling environment to facilitate private participation.", "With support from the World Bank, the Government initiated the Infrastructure Finance and Public Private Partnership (IFPPP) Project and has put in place a supportive legal and regulatory framework through the PPP Act, 2013 and the related Regulations, giving private participation a central role in the Government's long-term development strategy.", "The complementary roles of the Government and private sector in infrastructure funding were most recently highlighted at the UN's 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development, held in July 2015 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.", "At this summit, participants reiterated the vital roles both Governments and the private sector can play in infrastructure delivery, sustainable development and poverty eradication.", "Involving the private sector, not only eases the fiscal and administrative burden on Governments but also enhances efficiency in the delivery of key public services.", "In this regard, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are an increasingly popular mechanism by which the private sector has been brought in.", "PPPs are therefore among the options that have been sought by Governments to address this funding challenge.", "It is clear that there is interest in PPP projects in Kenya.", "As of July 2015, the National Treasury had approved 71 projects in transport, energy, education, water, health, agriculture and the hospitality sectors.", "Whereas many of these projects are still at the negotiation

Government is also considering Sukuk and Samurai bonds as options for further sovereign bond issuance.", "These will further widen investor participation and deepen the market.", "There is clearly a case for participation in PPPs by banks and other private financial institutions.", "However, there are a number of challenges that could arise from such participation, which I would like to highlight for your consideration in this forum.", "First, many infrastructure investments are long-term in nature, generating cash-flows many years after project inception.", "However, the maturity of most bank deposits is short-term.", "There is therefore a need for banks to manage this intermediation, taking a more long-term view about the economy, which we flag as the single most-important constraint.", "Additionally, alternate sources of longer-term funding could be sought.", "I am happy to note that banks in Kenya have started to explore solutions such as collaboration with multilateral lenders and development finance institutions to obtain long-term funding for infrastructure projects.", "Secondly, given the huge scale and long duration of many infrastructure projects, lenders are likely to find themselves exposed to significant credit, liquidity and political risks.", "It is therefore vital that all project proposals be thoroughly and reliably assessed for their economic, financial and technical viability before loans are disbursed.", "More importantly for banks, projects should have a clear and equitable contractual structure that optimally allocates project risks among participants.", "Such risks should be well-mitigated at the outset to make projects bankable.", "Thirdly, participation in infrastructure projects by banks would also be constrained by legal and prudential limits on the proportion of banks' lending as a share of their core capital.", "Given the considerable financial outlays involved in infrastructure projects, commercial banks would need to enhance their capital base to participate in PPPs while remaining compliant with regulatory requirements.", "Finally, given the increased investments in infrastructure and the environmental implications, I do hope that the studies lined up for discussion in this conference will give consideration to the green economy (green growth) aspects.", "This proactive discussion by the Kenyan banking industry will no doubt contribute towards adopting sustainable finance principles as per the commitments of the Addis Ababa Financing for Development Summit earlier mentioned.", "In view of the large size, huge cost and complexity of infrastructure projects, I would urge banks and other financial institutions to build the requisite legal and technical capacities to evaluate the value for money of PPPs relative to traditional asset classes.", "This will assist in identifying the potential risks and the risk mitigation to be put in place in advance before the commitments are undertaken.", "I take that the engagement you will have for the next two days will be an on-going conversation and the research work arising from this conference's theme will inform future research in the area.", "I am optimistic that the banking industry will continue to play an important role in supporting the various sectors of the economy and in particular, the challenge to address the nation's
