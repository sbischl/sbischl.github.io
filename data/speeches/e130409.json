labour market and are driving up house prices and debt.", "Thus, the Norwegian economy is also vulnerable.", "In the mid-1980s, the Norwegian economy was shaken by a sharp and long-lasting fall in oil prices.", "Today's situation is quite different.", "Oil prices are persistently high, reflecting the emergence of newly industrialised countries.", "But it is risky business to take today's oil price

become unprofitable, with considerable spillover effects on other sectors of our economy.", "Unemployment in Norway would probably rise.", "We cannot eliminate that risk.", "Curbing the exploitation of oil and gas resources is not a feasible alternative.", "The abiding question is rather how to limit the vulnerability associated with increased oil dependence.", "The fiscal rule for petroleum revenue spending is an important buffer.", "The petroleum fund mechanism and moderate and predictable spending of petroleum revenues over the central government budget contributes to enhancing economic stability.", "Reserves accumulated in the Government Pension Fund Global provide fiscal leeway in the event of an economic setback, as observed in 2008 and 2009.", "By limiting petroleum revenue spending to the expected real return on the Fund, we ensure that our petroleum wealth will benefit future generations.", "A balanced approach to revenue spending will allow future generations to benefit from what is spent on public investments domestically.", "The spending of petroleum revenues also has another facet.", "It increases the cost of Norwegian labour.", "During upturns Norwegian companies have fared well, in spite of rapidly rising costs, thanks to efficiency gains and rising producer prices.", "Some other countries in Europe allowed costs to rise at broadly the same pace over a number of years.", "Now these countries are in a downturn with a high level of spare capacity, and with a need to improve competitiveness.", "Should the outlook for the petroleum industry show a significant shift, Norway will have to start down the hard path of economic adjustment.", "The high level of costs in our country may become a hindrance in the competition for tenders and market shares.", "What we need above all is a profitable and efficient business sector that can adapt to new times.", "In that respect, there are some aspects of the Norwegian economy that give cause for reflection.", "On the surface, developments are positive.", "Nominal mainland GDP growth at current prices has been surprisingly stable.", "Over the past 20 years, nominal mainland GDP has increased by around 6 percent annually, and growth is still hovering around that trend.", "There were some tendencies towards overheating in the years prior to the financial crisis.", "But the correction that followed during and after the crisis has brought growth back to trend.", "There is little in this chart to indicate that the world economy has recently been through the most severe economic downturn in post-war history.", "The picture changes when growth is broken down into price and volume.", "As mentioned, high prices for domestically produced goods have supported our country's income.", "Since 2005, producer prices have increased considerably faster than trend.", "This illustrates that mainland businesses have also benefited from the substantial improvement in Norway's terms of trade.", "Economic activity, on the other hand, slumped during the financial crisis.", "Although economic growth has picked up in the past few years, the level is still well below the pre-crisis trend.", "This could indicate that the financial crisis and the debt crisis have had lasting effects on the Norwegian economy as well.", "The picture becomes even clearer when population growth is taken into account.", "Measured per capita, we do not generate more value today than we did five years ago.", "This picture is similar to that of other advanced economies.", "The break from the years prior to the financial crisis is clear.", "Growth is being supported by immigration and employment growth, not by increased productivity.", "There are two factors that determine value added and prosperity in a population.", "One is labour input and the other is labour productivity.", "I will look at some aspects of each of these factors.", "The employment ratio is high in Norway.", "Labour force participation is high and most jobseekers find work.", "Employment has increased rapidly since the mid-1990s.", "An expansionary monetary policy and additional government expenditure of oil money stimulated activity and employment through the financial crisis.", "Measured by hours worked, labour input has also risen, albeit not to the same extent.", "On average, the working day is shrinking.", "The employment ratio adjusted for working hours provides an expression of average labour input per hour worked among the active population.", "In this chart, hourly labour input is measured in relation to usual hours of work per year of 1 750 hours.", "In 2011, the average number of hours worked in Norway was about 60 percent of usual hours of work per year.", "By this measure, the employment ratio this year was higher in Greece than in Norway.", "Total labour input is considerably higher in Sweden, Finland and the US than in Norway.", "We work less than the OECD average.", "When income growth is high, it is natural that some of the increased wealth will be reflected in a greater demand for leisure.", "It is nevertheless telling that the number of hours actually worked is considerably lower in Norway than among our main trading partners, despite very low unemployment in Norway.", "Generous transfer schemes and other aspects of our welfare system induce many to exit the labour force - completely or partially.", "In recent years, the high level of labour immigration has compensated for this.", "Nonetheless, this situation does not seem sustainable.", "Reforms that provide stronger work incentives are needed and should be implemented in anticipation of an ageing population.", "The pension reform was an important step in the right direction.", "What about the other factor that is crucial to growth?", "Mainland productivity increased markedly in the 1990s, partly owing to a number of structural reforms.", "The banking sector was rationalised after the crisis.", "The tax reform set the stage for profitable investments and business sector restructuring.", "Improved competitiveness and the development of the oil industry facilitated the rapid integration of new technology by firms.", "Productivity growth remained relatively high up to around 2005.", "But since then it has declined.", "The decline has been more pronounced than among our trading partners.", "The phasing-in of a highly profitable oil industry and higher petroleum revenue spending via the central government budget has amplified the structural shifts in the Norwegian economy.", "When the financial crisis hit, industries that do not benefit from oil sector demand or public spending stagnated.", "The differences in growth across industries has thus widened since 2008.", "Labour-intensive sectors with relatively low productivity have accounted for a large share of employment growth in recent years.", "Employment has shown only moderate growth in industries with a high productivity level, such as manufacturing and engineering.", "Productivity growth has stagnated in most OECD countries.", "Goods production has declined, while services production has increased, as in Norway.", "In many countries this shift was based on borrowing rather than increased earnings.", "After the financial crisis, funding sources dried up and these countries were faced with a debt crisis.", "Fundamental structural problems with eroded competitiveness came into evidence.", "These countries must not only reduce their debt levels, but also engage in a painful process of structural adjustment.", "Only then can these economies find the path to renewed growth.", "The Norwegian economy has experienced virtually 20 consecutive years of growth.", "We have invested in a profitable oil industry and found a balance between spending petroleum revenues domestically and saving petroleum revenues.", "On the other hand, it seems that both the public and private sectors are having difficulties finding profitable mainland investment projects.", "Taking a longer view, this is a source of concern.", "Should petroleum revenues shrink, our economy needs more pillars to stand on.", "Otherwise, we as well would have to embark on a path of adjustment towards renewed growth.", "Perhaps Norway is not so much an economy apart after all.",
