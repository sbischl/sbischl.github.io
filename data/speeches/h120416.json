economy, establishing two main principles: economic policy must contribute to stable economic developments and be sustainable over time.", "By linking petroleum revenue spending to the expected real return on the Fund - and not to current petroleum revenues - the fiscal rule provided for a gradual and sustainable phasingin of the revenues.", "If we can restrict spending to the return, the Fund

be close to 4 percent over time.", "In the initial years, the actual return, adjusted for inflation and costs, was close to 4 percent.", "In recent years, with the financial crisis and the sovereign

percent, or a little higher, based on the then prevailing distribution between equities and bonds, was a reasonable assumption.", "Today, calculations yield a lower figure for expected real return.", "The real return on bonds in the Fund's portfolio can now be estimated at 1 percent.", "With a normal risk premium on equities, the real return on the whole Fund can be quantified at 3 percent.", "There is a possibility that the real return will be higher, but it may also be lower.", "If we spend more than the annual return on the Fund, we will be eating into the savings portion.", "The conclusion is that a more robust approach would now be to base fiscal policy on an annual expected real return on the Fund of 3 percent.", "Such an adjustment would underpin the main principles that were behind the establishment of the fiscal rule - stability and sustainability.", "In 2011 the structural non-oil budget deficit was about 3 percent, which is close to such a new path.", "Adapting petroleum revenue spending to a lower expected return should not therefore be particularly demanding.", "If we wait, a necessary policy adjustment later could be far more painful.", "Central banks in other countries are deploying strong measures to buoy up economic activity and inflation.", "Key interest rates in many countries are close to zero.", "Central banks in the US, UK and Japan have made large-scale bond purchases and thereby expanded their balance sheets in order to push down long-term interest rates.", "It is likely that the sharply expanded access to long-term liquidity from the

costs for Italy and Spain have declined.", "The EU is working on measures to restore financial market confidence - and public confidence.", "Greece has reached an agreement with its private creditors

consumption and investment decisions.", "At the same time, house prices and household debt are still rising.", "Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is now near a normal level.", "Growth in mainland GDP is projected at about 3 percent this year and in the years ahead, broadly in pace with potential output growth.", "The operational target of monetary policy is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 percent over time.", "Recently, inflation has been low, close to 1 percent.", "Inflation will be brought back to target, but how long this will take depends on the disturbances to which the economy is exposed and their effect on the prospects for the path for inflation and the real economy ahead.", "When setting the key policy rate, we do not exclusively assign weight to bringing inflation back to target, but we also take into account the impact of the interest rate on output and employment.", "The inflation targeting regime is flexible.", "By taking account of the deviation in the nominal interest rate from a normal level when setting the key policy rate, Norges Bank seeks to counter the build-up of financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation further ahead.", "This does not mean that the level of the key policy rate is an independent objective of monetary policy.", "Rather, the purpose is to overcome weaknesses in our analytical tools in order to cope with the possible build-up of financial imbalances resulting from keeping interest rates low over time.", "At our most recent interest rate meeting the key policy rate was reduced by 0.25 percentage \"...weak growth points to 1.50 percent.", "In its assessment the Executive Board stated that: prospects abroad and the strong krone are contributing to keeping inflation low and dampening economic growth in Norway (...).", "If the interest rate is set too high, the krone may appreciate further, inflation may continue to fall and growth in output and employment may become too low.", "This suggests that the key policy rate should be reduced further.", "On the other hand, there is virtually normal capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy.", "Moreover, low interest rates over time may induce households and enterprises to take excessive risks and accumulate excessive debt.\"", "After a decade of learning, inflation targeting has become more flexible.", "The current outlook suggests that it will likely take several years before inflation is back on target.", "However, the inflation target has to be reached over time, otherwise our credibility is put at risk.", "Flexibility is good to have, and easy to lose.", "In assessing various considerations, monetary policy must be geared to meet its primary objective of low and stable inflation.", "There are limits as to how many goals monetary policy can meet.", "Other instruments must be used to attain other objectives.", "To ensure that new or further financial imbalances do not build up, we also need a tighter overarching international policy framework to address the stability of the financial system as a whole.", "A macroprudential policy framework should be part of this new framework.", "Macroprudential policy framework Financial market participants can trigger self-reinforcing economic fluctuations.", "Individual banks and investors do not necessarily take into account the overall risk in the financial system.", "The consequences became clear during the financial crisis: banks had inadequate equity capital, relied excessively on short-term wholesale funding and had insufficient buffers of liquid assets.", "The new international regulatory framework is intended to remedy this situation.", "Stricter capital adequacy and liquidity coverage standards are in the offing.", "The authorities will also be able to tailor banks' capital requirements to the overall risk in the financial system.", "During upturns, these requirements can be raised, so that banks will have to hold more capital for their loans.", "This will smooth lending growth and better equip banks to bear losses during downturns.", "The authorities must acquire tools that allow banks to be wound up in an orderly manner.", "Banks must also draw up plans for their own liquidation in the event of difficulties.", "Owners and creditors - not taxpayers - must bear the losses.", "Politicians have the overriding responsibility for financial stability.", "It can be demanding to restrain credit growth in times of strong optimism and confidence in the future.", "Well defined mandates and a clear delegation of responsibility in the field of monetary policy has worked well.", "Similarly, the legal authority to implement macroprudential measures to safeguard financial stability should be delegated.", "We can never fully insulate the financial system from shocks.", "But we can increase our resilience.", "One of the most important things we can do is to keep our own house in order - by preventing major imbalances from building up in the economy or in the financial system, and by ensuring that the financial system in general is robust.", "Thank you for your attention."],
