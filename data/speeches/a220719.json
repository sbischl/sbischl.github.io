Core Logic; RBA; Securitisation System But some indebted households are more vulnerable So far I have focused on household debt in aggregate and made the point that there are a number of factors suggesting that indebted households will be quite resilient to at least some rise in interest rates.", "But not all borrowers are alike - the distribution also matters.", "In particular, what do we know about the incomes of the people that hold the debt?", "If we look at the households that have debt, almost three-quarters of debt outstanding is held by households in the top 40 per cent of the income distribution; indebted households in the bottom 20 per cent of the income distribution hold less than 5 per cent of the debt (Graph 7).", "Furthermore, households with high debt-to-income ratios (DTIs) who might be most affected by a rise in interest rates also tend to be high-income households.", "Higher income households can typically devote a higher share of their incomes to debt servicing because their other living expenses tend to account for a smaller share of their income.", "This suggests that a large number of households are likely to be able to handle somewhat higher interest rates.", "Sources: ABS; RBA Nevertheless, some households are more likely to face financial stress than others.", "Highly indebted households are especially vulnerable in the event of a loss of real income through higher inflation, particularly if combined with rising interest rates, and a decrease in housing prices.", "Recent borrowers are more vulnerable than earlier cohorts, as they are more likely to have borrowed at high DTIs, have had their serviceability assessed at lower interest rates (albeit with larger interest rate buffers) and have had less time to accumulate equity and liquidity buffers.", "Government policies to improve housing market accessibility for first home buyers (FHBs) during the pandemic also means that FHBs are more highly represented among this group of recent borrowers than they are in earlier cohorts.", "borrowers, making them more vulnerable to a given house price or cash flow shock.", "The increase in high-DTI borrowing is one area that raises concerns about risks as interest rates rise.", "While lending standards have generally improved over recent years, the latest housing cycle saw a significant increase in the share of loans at DTI ratios above 6 (Graph 8), partly reflecting the very low interest rates at that time and hence the belief that the debt servicing burden of these loans was manageable.", "On the face of it, such loans are more risky than loans at lower DTIs.", "If the borrower were to experience a fall in income or an increase in expenses, they might find it more difficult to service the loan.", "And in an environment of increasing interest rates, there is a risk that households with high DTIs will find it more difficult to service their debt.", "Sources: APRA; RBA We know, however, that other characteristics matter as well.", "The size of liquidity buffers and the income and wealth of the borrower also impacts the riskiness of the loan and the probability of borrowers ending up in financial difficulty.", "Broadly, investors with high-DTI loans are more likely than other borrowers to have high liquidity buffers; they also tend to be wealthier and have higher incomes.", "This group of high-DTI borrowers has historically been less likely to experience mortgage stress than other borrowers.", "On the other hand, there is a group of borrowers with high-DTI loans that have lower liquidity buffers and lower incomes - these borrowers are more at risk of mortgage stress.", "So the bottom line is that high-DTI lending is something to watch.", "But in and of itself, a high-DTI loan is not necessarily more risky in a rising interest rate environment.", "The impact on individual borrowers will be varied But what can we say about the impact of interest rate rises on individual borrowers?", "We can use data on individual anonymised loans from our securitisation database to do some scenario analysis on the potential impact of interest rate rises on the borrowers in that dataset.", "For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that variable mortgage rates rise by around 300 basis points, which is broadly informed by recent market pricing to mid-2023.", "The data suggest that over one-third of variable-rate borrowers have already been making average monthly loan payments (including irregular payments to redraw and offset accounts) sufficient to meet the resulting rise in required repayments (Graph 9).", "In other words, there is limited impact on these borrowers.", "On the other hand, just under 30 per cent of borrowers would face relatively large repayment increases of more than 40 per cent of their current payments.", "Repayment Increases for Variable-rate Loans Changes in repayments in response to a 300 basis point increase in interest rates* 10 10 None 0 to 10 to 20 to 30 to 40+ Increase in repayments (%) Changes between new required repayments and average monthly payments over the past year;
