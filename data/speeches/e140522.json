reforms.", "The economic rebalancing and financial reforms have resulted in stronger fundamentals, and a solid and sound financial system, both of which have proved to be vital in enabling Asia to weather the recent global financial turbulence.", "With more diversified economic structures, in particular with the increased role of domestic demand as an important source of growth, with the

extend the outreach to a wider spectrum of society.", "Another development affecting economic well-being is the rapid urbanisation in Asia.", "This trend is expected to continue, with the region's urban population projected to increase from 1.9 billion currently to 3.3 billion by 2050.", "The bulk of this urban population will consist of the middle income, where the current middle class of more

environment of the host countries where they have operations.", "The alignment to the long-term interest of the country will be mutually reinforcing as it will provide for achieving socio-economic stability, thereby creating a stable environment for the conduct of business activity.", "Second, Asia needs to be better-positioned to harness the opportunities from productivity enhancement.", "As Asia becomes more developed, its future growth will increasingly depend on the transition from growth based on labour and capital accumulation, to one that is more deeply rooted in productivity gains.", "This will need to involve the wider adoption of high technology in production, transport and marketing, the effective protection of intellectual property rights, and the development of a

forward, collective and coordinated actions will enhance the ability to manage and respond to risks to the region, thus contributing to regional financial stability.", "Fifth, is the need to further strengthen overall practices for greater transparency, accountability, governance and integrity.", "These enhanced practices will empower both the public and private sectors to successfully implement reforms and ensure resource allocation that will contribute to sustainable growth.", "Of importance, is to ensure that, in tandem with rising growth, there continues to be economic and financial accountability.", "For Asia, this involves the development of more transparent business models, responsible leadership expectations, and strengthened incentive systems and governance arrangements.", "Additionally, consumer and shareholder activism are also powerful complements in exerting discipline and serving as a check and balance, against imprudent and irresponsible behavior.", "For Asia to truly reach its potential, a further area of focus is to give attention to closing the governance deficit in businesses and governments, and to raise the standards of management in all spheres of economic activities.", "Examples of these include the production of goods and services by businesses and in the delivery of public services, such as safety and security, healthcare services and transportation that have strict adherence to the appropriate standards.", "To achieve this, it requires not just the adoption of best governance and management practices, but also ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring.", "There are several examples in advanced economies, including in Asia, in which these high standards have contributed significantly to the economic well-being.", "Sixth is for Asia to remain fully engaged in the international process.", "Asia has much to contribute to global discourse and dialogue, particularly in standard-setting bodies where
