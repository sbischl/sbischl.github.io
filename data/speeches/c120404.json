Uncertainty on the tax treatment of Shariah-compliant financial instruments; Inadequacy of the requisite human capital with respect to Shariah-compliant finance.", "Ladies and gentlemen: The Central Bank is in this regard engaging other relevant arms of Government to address these challenges in order to propel Shariah-compliant finance to the next level.", "The future of Islamic Finance in Kenya and in the region remains bright.", "On its part, the Central Bank will continue to pursue policies that create an enabling environment that will eventually culminate in Kenya establishing itself as a regional financial hub as envisaged in Vision 2030.", "With these few remarks, I want to wish First Community Bank Ltd as well as the First Community Bank Capital (Investment Bank) the best in their future endeavours.", "The Islamic Finance picture is thus complete."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Shariah-compliant finance", "Islamic Finance", "Shariah-compliant banking", "Shariah-compliant products", "First Community Bank", "Kenya", "Takaful Insurance", "Shariah-compliant mutual fund", "Vision 2030", "Central Bank"]}
