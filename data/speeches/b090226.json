absolute transparency of banks' assets.", "Investors and markets remain sceptical about the balance sheets of many financial institutions, and as a consequence the flow of capital into the banking industry has dwindled to a trickle, the level of capital that the market requires of banks has risen, and banks are under pressure to reduce their assets.", "Internationally coordinated action by supervisors in the principal financial centres is needed to produce uniform valuations of banks' assets in order to enhance the credibility and reliability of financial statements.", "The measures announced by various countries in recent weeks, such as ring-fencing the most problematic securities in banks' balance sheets or transferring them to separate entities (bad banks), are welcome in that

gatherings about the progress we have made in revising the global regulatory framework, progress that would have been unthinkable just months ago.", "Today, I want to mention the work under way in international fora to build a system of macroprudential supervision to flank the traditional oversight of individual institutions.", "This new perspective carries significant consequences for the extension and application of the regulations.", "Among these: every financial institution capable of creating systemic risk will be subject to supervision; the authorities will insist on knowing both the correlations between the exposures of the various financial institutions and the way in which risk is transferred over time and space; consideration will be given to the possibility of creating new capital and liquidity buffers that expand in times of growth and contract in the downward phases of the cycle and to the establishment of a leverage ratio that limits the growth in financial leverage; and measures will be taken to reduce the risks attached to OTC products by creating central counterparties.", "The announcement of banks' participation in the construction of a central platform for trading in credit default swaps is a step in this direction.", "The new platform will bring clarity in a market which, because of its size and opacity, is currently regarded as potentially capable of amplifying the crisis.", "It is envisaged that, at international level, the governance of financial institutions, executive compensation, and the special duties of intermediaries to protect retail investors will be subject to explicit supervision.", "Further, the formation of supervisory colleges for major international intermediaries will be generalized.", "Eighteen months after the world financial crisis erupted Italy's banks are in better shape than the largest international banks.", "They have been protected by a low level of financial leverage, a business model firmly based on traditional lending and rooted in the relationship with household and business customers, and a prudent regulatory framework and system of supervision.", "In 2008 the major international financial centres were the scene of the sudden collapse of leading institutions and repeated, large-scale government bail-outs.", "The financial turmoil has affected the financial conditions of our banks, but to a fairly limited extent: from the onset of the phase of financial instability to the third quarter of 2008, the last period for which the consolidated quarterly reports have been released, the leading Italian groups made writedowns of some \u20ac4.5 billion as a result of the crisis, a substantial amount but less than for major foreign banks.", "Profits declined, but were still positive in the first nine months of the year.", "Overall, capital has remained above minimum requirements.", "The capital ratios of Italian banking groups are calculated on the basis of stricter prudential criteria than are applied in other systems.", "Above all, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers the greatest short-term risk for the stability of the international financial system has been the liquidity shortage.", "Italy has not escaped this.", "In the unsecured interbank market, turnover fell for all maturities and virtually disappeared for those beyond one week.", "At present, liquidity conditions have eased.", "The spread between unsecured and secured three-month interbank rates, which had widened to 185 basis points on 10 October, has progressively narrowed, reaching 90 basis points in the last few days.", "Trading in slightly longer maturities has resumed.", "Some channels of finance that had been clogged appear to be opening up again, even beyond the short term; in January, the corporate bond market showed signs of revival, an important development in a phase when bonds issued by banks in recent years are maturing.", "But the recovery is fragile and highly uncertain.", "To provide the banking system with liquidity, so as to prevent any interruption of the flow of credit and payments, has been the principal concern of the authorities for many weeks.", "Central banks have acted rapidly and in coordinated fashion; the Eurosystem has been one of the key actors.", "The guarantees introduced by the Italian government and the Bank of Italy have sustained confidence in the banking system and assisted the recovery of the interbank market; we have reported on this on several occasions.", "On the second of February, in collaboration with the Italian Banking Association and e-MID S.p.A., we launched the Collateralized Interbank Market, which allows banks to trade interbank funds anonymously and with a guarantee against the risks of counterparty illiquidity and insolvency.", "The interest rates in this market have been lower than those on the uncollateralized market and in the Euribor fixing, reflecting the containment of risk premiums.", "The Collateralized Interbank Market is open not only to Italian banks but also to other European banks that meet the same requirements, subject to agreement with their home central banks.", "Complacency about the danger we have avoided so far is of no help, we must look ahead.", "The recession in Europe will inevitably end up by weighing on the accounts of our banks.", "Credit risks are emerging both in the traditional sectors of activity and in the emerging economies; our banking system, like those of others, is exposed to deterioration in the latter's performance.", "The increase in provisions for loan losses will hurt the banks' results for this year.", "The market has discounted this in its valuations.", "It is necessary to take action to strengthen the prudential defences against the worsening of the cyclical situation and at the same time to create conditions that will guarantee an adequate flow of credit, so as to avoid a downward spiral of tight credit and economic contraction.", "Beyond the short term, recovery of the real economy is a necessary condition for banks' solidity.", "Lending by the Italian banking system, which was still growing fast in the first part of 2008, slowed down over the year; the deceleration became sharp in the last few months.", "In the fourth quarter the growth in credit to the private sector fell to 4.2 per cent on an annual basis, half as great as in the three previous months.", "In 2008 the stock grew by 7.4 per cent, a slowdown of more than 3 percentage points compared with 2007.", "According to the provisional data referring to the sample of banks that provide 10-day reports, the stock of total credit stagnated in January.", "If this is confirmed, this would imply a fall in just one month of about half a percentage point in the twelve-month rate of growth.", "The slowdown is common to the other major European countries and has affected all parts of the country and all categories of borrowers.", "The growth rate was modest particularly for small enterprises and manufacturing industry; construction recorded an especially large slowdown.", "The fall in production and the uncertain cyclical outlook have depressed the demand for funds for fixed investment and working capital.", "Households' demand for loans reflected the fall in housing market activity and purchases of durable goods.", "In 2008 lending to the sector grew by 6 per cent, compared with increases of more than 10 per cent in the previous years.", "Personal loans continue to expand at a lively pace.", "The outcome for credit was also influenced by the more cautious lending policies adopted by banks in response to the increase in the cost of fund-raising, the partial closure of international sources, the deterioration in customers' creditworthiness and the need to improve capital ratios to cope with the pressure exerted by the markets at a time of pronounced uncertainty.", "In 2008 resources obtained from foreign banks and money market funds fell by about 10 per cent.", "They had risen by 20 per cent in 2007 and 34 per cent in 2006, when they had contributed nearly half the growth in fund-raising.", "Banks have responded to the smaller inflow from abroad by increasing the funds they raise from Italian households, above all with bonds.", "In 2008 the average cost of total fund-raising rose by 40 basis points compared with the previous year; since October it has started to fall following the reductions in official interest rates and the partial normalization of the interbank market.", "Loan quality is being affected by the recession.", "Since the third quarter of last year the flow of new bad debts has been increasing rapidly, and in the last quarter of 2008 the ratio to total outstanding loans was the highest since 1999 (not counting the peak in the fourth quarter of 2003 due to the failure of Parmalat).", "The deterioration continued in January, when the total debt of newly insolvent customers was 70 per cent greater than in January 2008.", "The system has a major strength - private-sector debt is considerably lower in Italy than in other countries.", "Corporate financial debt amounts to 75 per cent of GDP, around 12 points lower than the European average.", "The leverage of Italian firms is now seven points lower than at the turn of the 1990s, on the eve of the last recession, and the percentage of financial costs covered by internally generated funds is higher.", "For households, though financial debt is greater than in the past, it is still no more than 49 per cent of disposable income, as against over 90 per cent in the euro area as a whole and 150 per cent in the United Kingdom and the United States.", "The most recent data indicate that in the third quarter of 2008, allocations to provisions and value adjustments absorbed 30 per cent of the operating profit of Italy's largest banking groups.", "This ratio, though still far below the level recorded in the United States, is rising rapidly; it is worth recalling that at the end of the much less severe recession in the 1990s it exceeded 70 per cent.", "Just as banks have been asked to shed full light on the troubled assets that have been on their books since the onset of the crisis, it is equally important that they conduct a realistic, unflinching estimate of the loan losses that they are bound to incur in the months to come; and that this estimate serve as the basis for conducting balance-sheet management and determining capital injections, dividend policy and executive compensation.", "Strengthening the banks in order to sustain the economy Guaranteeing a sufficient supply of credit while at the same time maintaining sound and prudent lending standards - this is the challenge that faces the banking system in 2009.", "A credit squeeze would aggravate the recession; a reduction in prudence could jeopardize the banks' stability, with serious consequences for their medium-term lending capacity and for the economy.", "The objective of making funds available to the economy must not be pursued by relaxing standards of creditworthiness but by strengthening the capital base, in order to overcome undue constraints on asset growth.", "I have had occasion, elsewhere, to remark that the approach to capital strengthening must be pragmatic.", "Banks must take all necessary measures and seize all opportunities.", "Some groups have already begun to move by disposing of non-essential assets, retaining earnings and going to the market.", "With the finalization of the implementing measures, the public funds provided by Law 2/2009 will soon be available.", "Thanks in part to a fruitful dialogue with the banking system, the instruments offered by the state have been refined, within the limits of EU regulations, to provide a range of flexible possibilities that can be adapted to the needs of the various banks and banking groups.", "If the funds made available by the state are adequate and the accompanying conditions are reasonable and practical, designed to attain the objective without administrative interference in business decisions, they should be used.", "It is also desirable to revise the tax treatment of loan losses.", "In Italy, banks and other financial intermediaries may only deduct loan writedowns up to 0.3 per cent of total lending.", "Writedowns above that amount are deductible over 18 years.", "France, Germany and the United Kingdom, by contrast, allow the full and immediate deduction of all value adjustments entered in the accounts.", "The Italian rules have a procyclical effect: if bad debts increase, the costs to the financial system are aggravated, because the volume of non-deductible losses increases.", "They are particularly onerous in the present phase of the cycle.", "Banks' reputation, an underpinning of stability Always, but especially at times of crisis, a bank's good name is its most valuable asset, the basis of a solid relationship with customers.", "Safeguarding and enhancing the banking system's reputation equally requires irreproachable conduct and rigorous rules.", "The correctness of banks' conduct is important for the Bank of Italy because it is a precondition for stability.", "This is especially true at times like the present, when recourse to customers' savings has proved essential to enable the banking system to compensate, swiftly and substantially, for the contraction in other sources of funding.", "Overseeing the transparency and correct conduct of those who offer financial products and investment services is the responsibility of Consob.", "For typical banking transactions, the law entrusts such supervision to the Bank of Italy.", "Within a few weeks we will hold a public consultation on new rules, which are being drafted in cooperation with the associations of banks, other intermediaries and consumers.", "We will make the documents for customers clearer, more concise and comparable.", "We will use especially incisive instruments for the most widely used products, mortgage loans and current accounts.", "We will ask that attention to customers' needs be at the centre of every phase of the production process.", "Transparency of corporate governance and openness of ownership structures are also preconditions for the good name and efficiency of banks.", "Formerly, the banking system, constricted by extensive public ownership and a web of rules that conditioned all its activity, had a concentrated and closed ownership structure and its conduct was scarcely competitive.", "Enormous progress has been made in recent decades.", "The system of public banks has been dismantled.", "Consolidation has revolutionized the industry's ownership structures.", "Banking foundations, having given up control almost everywhere, have transformed themselves into investors attentive to long-run prospects.", "The Antitrust Authority recently drew attention to some structural issues concerning the system: concentration of ownership, cross-shareholdings and interlocking directorships.", "However, it should be noted that concentration of ownership, a common characteristic of listed Italian companies, is less pronounced for banks than for companies in other sectors.", "The incidence of cross-shareholdings between the leading banks appears to be lower than in other countries of continental Europe.", "As regards interlocking directorships, a matter within the competence of the Antitrust Authority insofar as it concerns competition, it is first of all up to the Government and Parliament, to which the Authority addresses its reports, to evaluate whether action is needed and what measures to adopt."],
