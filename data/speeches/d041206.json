(ii) the operation of insurance companies; (iii) the development of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Area; and (iv) the design of an ideal accounting framework for the plantation economy.", "It's interesting, but many of these continue to be burning issues today.", "For many years this conference continued to be staged, in a process of close collaboration between the regional Central Banks, University of the West Indies and the University of Guyana, but essentially administered by the University.", "And here we need to pay tribute to those \"essentially unpaid co-ordinators\" who did yeoman work in keeping the programme alive: Professor Compton Bourne, Maurice Odle, Adlith Browne and Ramesh Ramsaran.", "In May 1995, UWI and the Regional Central Banks signed a formal agreement to establish the Caribbean Centre for Monetary Studies (the CCMS).", "The core mission of the Centre is to provide CARICOM Central Banks with timely economic intelligence as well as monetary and financial policy (i) conducting relevant research;
