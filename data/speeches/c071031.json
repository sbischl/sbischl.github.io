greater expectation and demands on the leadership and senior management of insurers in driving fundamental changes required within the organization in response to the changing regulatory landscape.",

management practices will be given greater regulatory flexibility.", "Thirdly, the advent of bancassurance and bancatakaful has seen more players packaging life insurance and family takaful with

higher level of public confidence in financial dealings with banks and the significant spin-offs that can be reaped through data mining arrangements with banks.", "Although bancassurance has become
