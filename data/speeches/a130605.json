when the economy was in the midst of a period of impressive growth, and one of the reasons for the fact that we made it through the global crisis was that the economy entered the crisis in good condition: the government budget was balanced in 2007, the current account was in surplus, the banks were strong-everything required for a country to successfully get through the crisis was in place in Israel before the crisis.", "I would also like to thank the former Chairman of the Finance Committee, MK Rabbi Moshe Gafni, who contributed much to the system's stability, and to the legislation of the new Bank of Israel Law, which was also helped along by former Knesset Speaker MK Reuven Rivlin.", "I recognize the fact that you cannot work alone-it is necessary for there to be people who agree

control over the budget, the government recently decided on important measures to reduce the deficit in the coming years.", "These measures are also very important due to the fact that the interest burden that the government is paying is very high in international comparison, as a result of the risk premium that the financial markets include for the Israeli economy.", "A diplomatic process, if

only the ease of doing business, but also the cost of living.", "For instance, we see its effect on the ability to adjust the supply of housing and on housing prices.", "The Concentration Committee made two important recommendations on the matter of breaking apart pyramids and separating financial and real holdings.", "In this context, I note that if we require the immediate complete separation of financial and real holdings, there would be no people who would be able to be controlling owners of banks, since they would not be able to obtain the required capital through their activities in the real industries.", "It is possible that in another few decades, we will reach the conclusion that controlling owners are not necessary for banks.", "But in the meantime, I suggest not to conduct such large experiments on the financial system.", "I usually don't make comparisons to Greece, but this time I will do so: For hundreds of years, we have seen the ramifications that an unstable
