relevant to the process of shaping monetary policy for the euro area - the euro area as a whole.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, At its start, the Eurosystem has seen a period of unprecedented price stability.", "In 1998 and 1999, consumer prices rose by only 1.1 percent; in the year 2000, the inflation rate, at 2.3 percent, ran a little above the two-percent ceiling, after the sharp increase in

goal: keeping inflation in check.", "If possible without compromising price stability, it shall support general economic policiesThe reasoning behind this policy mandate is threefold.", "First, there is a purely economic reason.", "Keeping overall inflation low is the best contribution a central bank can make to sound economic growth.", "Furthermore, inflation tends to modify distribution in an unfavorable way.", "Second, there is the well-known principle of reaching a bundle of policy goals best if each institution is assigned only one of the goals.", "And, third, there is the argument based on democracy theory: once an institution is granted independence, it should be given a clear mandate in return.", "A generally stable currency, and markets that trust the stability orientation of central banks, make for lower price increases at times of crisis.", "They also anchor inflation expectations at low levels.", "The larger currency area is able to cushion external shocks.", "In its brief history, the Eurosystem has already dealt successfully with three external shocks and crises.", "We have seen the Asian crisis in 1997-99, an oil-price shock in 1999-2000 and, most recently, the terrorist attacks.", "Europe did not escape unscathed from all these events.", "However, the low level of turbulence within the euro area contrasts with sharper reactions to similar events in the period before EMU existed.", "This means that we have withstood what has been regarded as the worst-case scenario for the new currency.", "The European currency area exhibits greater macroeconomic stability, to the benefit of all its citizens, and also to the benefit of the world economy at large.", "For this greater macroeconomic stability to become reality, convergence is of paramount importance.", "Economic convergence is a precondition for the \"one-size-fits-all\" monetary policy really fitting all the regions in the euro area.", "A currency union, both stable and beneficial, needs convergence in all three respects: nominal, real and structural convergence.", "The European single currency fostered stronger economic integration by means of foreign direct investment.", "Intra-EU FDI flows grew significantly faster over that period.", "In addition, intra-EU direct investment has risen significantly since the start of EMU.", "Today, intra-EU FDI accounts for one-quarter of world foreign direct investment.", "FDI stocks show a similar picture.", "Intra-EU FDI stocks make up 22 percent of world FDI stocks.", "Almost one-half of the FDI stock originating in the European union is invested in another EU member state.", "The FDI statistics clearly show, first, that economic integration in the EU is intense, and, second, that economic integration deepened fast after the introduction of the common currency.", "These observations are borne out by the trade statistics.", "About one-half of the external trade of the euro-area member states is intra-euro-area trade.", "It is in the financial markets that the benefits of a common European currency are to be felt most clearly.", "The implications of the euro are obvious: rising liquidity, deepening and widening of the money, bond and stock markets, reduction of transaction costs and abolition of currency risks.", "The euro speeds up financial market integration.", "Correspondingly, the functioning of the European Monetary Union depends heavily on a high degree of financial market integration.", "Its smooth functioning enables monetary transmission to work.", "Progress in this field is tremendous, but more is yet to come.", "Those parts of the European financial markets that are crucial to the transmission of the Eurosystem's monetary policy are already integrated to our satisfaction.", "The wholesale market for interbank liquidity in the euro area is now actually a single European money market.", "In addition, European banks are interconnected in a common payment-system infrastructure.", "And improvements to the euro-area-wide payment system are being undertaken.", "A few days ago, the Bundesbank launched its new payment system RTGSplus, which improves security, reduces liquidity needs and expedites settlements of gross payments.", "Through this system, about 8,500 banks and credit institutions, including their branches all over the world, are accessible.", "The most impressive progress, in terms of integration, has been witnessed in the euro-area bond markets.", "Yield differences among the government bonds of the different participants have narrowed from more than five percentage points before EMU to some 30 basis points nowadays.", "The remaining spread is mainly due to the varying liquidity of the papers issued.", "Currency risks or divergent monetary policies no longer disturb the euro-area-wide diversification.", "In terms of outstanding amounts, the euro-denominated bond market is still significantly smaller than that denominated in US dollars.", "But in terms of new issuance, both markets are on a par.", "One reason for that is the sharp rise in the new issuance of corporate bonds.", "Here again, diversification within the euro area has increased.", "The issuers' nationality, as a determinant of the yield and performance of bonds, has been superseded by other factors, especially by a sectoral view.", "Accordingly, investors in the equity markets have shifted their perspective from country benchmarks to pan-European sector benchmarks.", "European equity markets are still small compared with those in the USA.", "The market capitalization of domestic shares, as a ratio of GDP, reaches about 90 percent [2000].", "The matching figures for the USA and Japan are 152 percent and 68 percent, respectively.", "Equity markets in the Euro area are growing fast.", "The ratio of new issuance to market capitalisation averages over 4 percent.", "This is twice as much as has been achieved in the USA or Japan.", "Further integration of equity markets in Europe is being hampered by the segmentation of both stock exchanges and clearing and settlement systems.", "A consolidation process has started, and should be fostered by legal harmonization in the field of financial services.", "The degree of integration in the banking sector is mixed.", "On the one hand, wholesale markets and investment banking are largely integrated.", "On the other hand, commercial credits and retail banking still operate in national, segmented markets.", "Only a few European banks created by cross-border mergers start to offer retail services at a standardized level for customers in more than one country.", "The financial system in the euro area is still highly bank-dominated.", "At the end of last year, credit financing totaled about 108 percent of GDP.", "This is twice as much as in the USA.", "The same ratio holds for deposits.", "In the euro area, they account for 80 percent of GDP, while the US figure is about 40 percent.", "However, capital markets are increasing in importance in the euro area.", "Disintermediation is gaining ground.", "Financial markets have boomed in recent years and investment banks (as well as non-bank financial firms like institutional investors, pension and investment funds) have enlarged their market share.", "Disintermediation will be enhanced by the need for pension systems to rely more on funded retirement schemes.", "Disintermediation will change the transmission process.", "Basically, it is speeded up.", "And disintermediation will change the income structure of banks.", "A rising share of fees and dividends, at the expense of interest income, will increase the volatility of banks' income.", "Since capital markets are more integrated than the banking sector, disintermediation will foster the integration of the entire financial system in Europe.", "Changes for the banking sector are in prospect once the new Basle Accord is applied.", "In general, we welcome the new accord if it helps to improve the allocation of capital.", "However, two special features of the German economy should be considered: 1.", "The German economy is largely dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, known as the \u201eMittelstand\".", "Our financial systems rely to a large extent on long-term financing.", "This long-termism of financing has contributed successfully to the stability and prosperity of our economy, as well as the financial system.", "That is why the Bundesbank argues that banking regulation should not discriminate against long term financial relations.", "Small and medium-sized enterprises with a revenue of up to \u03c6 5 million make up more than 95 percent of all enterprises in Germany.", "This \u201eMittelstand\" forms the backbone of the German economy.", "However, their share of outside capital is significantly higher than with larger firms.", "A lower rating is therefore to be expected, unless other collateral or risk-lowering factors are taken into account.", "Here again, we favor a differentiated approach that does not put banks with a large disposure to small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage.", "Since we do not want the new Basle Accord to endanger the prosperity or stability of our economy, and our financial system, we have to convince our partners to agree to a more differentiated accord.", "Let us share a few thoughts on the international role of the euro.", "Three years into its life, the euro is the second most important currency in the world.", "It took over that role from the Deutschmark.", "The euro has a share of roughly 13 percent in international currency reserves - about as much as the Deutschmark had before.", "In this field, the dollar is the unchallenged leader, at two-thirds of international reserves.", "The size, depth and liquidity of the dollar markets, as well as the widespread habit of using the dollar for interventions and for pricing commodities, explain its predominance.", "As regards its use as a store of value, we find some evidence of the growing importance of the euro.", "percent [at end-2000] of all international securities outstanding are denominated in euro.", "This share is slightly above the aggregate share of the predecessor currencies shortly before EMU was launched.", "That leaves the euro as the second-most-important currency in the international securities markets.", "Again, the dollar is the dominant currency, accounting for one-half of all international securities outstanding.", "A look at the flow data underlines the growing importance of the euro as a means of international finance and investment.", "In its first year (1999) the euro was the most important currency for debt-securities issues that were aimed at the international market; in the year 2000, it fell back somewhat, to 40 percent.", "The currency composition of international bank assets presents a similar picture.", "Again, the dollar is the leading currency, with a share of 40 percent, while the euro is in the process of catching up.", "From slightly less than one-quarter at the end of 1998, its share rose to 27 percent, twelve percentage points of which were intra-EU bank assets.", "What can we see from these figures?", "Although habits in the international use of currencies change only gradually, the euro has already won a respectable market share.", "Its market share roughly equals the economic weight of the euro area.", "Further progress in the development of broad, deep and liquid financial markets is a precondition for the expansion of the euro's international role.", "Increased international use of the euro, as a currency for international reserve holdings, for investment and financing purposes, might have some bearing on monetary policy, but this potential impact seems manageable.", "Hence, in the Eurosystem, we have adopted a neutral stance towards the internationalization of the euro.", "We regard it as a market-driven process, and we neither hinder it nor foster it.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, For Europe, the introduction of the single currency is an event of historic scope.", "The launch of the European System of Central Banks came with a promise of stability and prosperity.", "Stability must be earned, again and again, day by day.", "The German \"Stabilita\u0308tskultur\" - one may translate this as \"stability culture\" - is one of our most cherished exports to our European partner countries.", "European people now share a firm stability orientation.", "Prosperity must likewise be earned, again and again, day by day.", "The Eurosystem can and does contribute by providing an environment of stability, where prices are fairly accurate indicators of relative scarcity.", "The ensuing efficient allocation of resources is a precondition for prosperity.", "However, other policy areas can - and must - do more in this respect than monetary policy.", "People in the European Monetary Union hold on to the single market and the single currency, because they know it is good for them - individually - and also for their countries.", "This, ladies and gentlemen, is
