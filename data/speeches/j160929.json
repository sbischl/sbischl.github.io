institutions as a new source of funding.", "Niche institutions such as factoring and leasing companies, angel funds and alternative credit providers of various industries such as motor, housing and consumer retail sector can play an important role in contributing towards providing consumers with greater funding choices.", "There, however exist a high bar and strict preconditions that must be met

are some of the critical foundation required to ensure these institutions 'clear the hurdle' to become a viable source or financing and benefit our economy.", "The ultimate aim remains in protecting consumers' interests, preventing predatory practices, managing debt levels, including high household debt, and preventing borrowers from falling into financial hardship due to inability to service debt.", "At the same time, we must not ignore important changes in the global and domestic financial landscape that will affect current and future priorities to deliver a financial system that effectively serves our economy.", "One of the most significant changes has been the commoditisation of financial services.", "This has been largely driven by technological advancements, enabling

and innovation We are entering a new era of economic development of unprecedented nature, one of the most important roles of the financial sector will be financing innovation and supporting businesses in managing the associated risks.", "Competing objectives and the obligations of financial institutions to depositors and policyholders have suggested that this role is likely to be more limited for traditional financial institutions.", "However, there are growing prospects for financial institutions to support innovation without compromising the overriding obligations to safeguard deposits and claims by policyholders.", "Two notable developments have supported this.", "The first is the evolution of a more comprehensive ecosystem for innovation.", "This includes incubator programmes that are proving to be highly successful in helping entrepreneurs commercialise ideas and scale up companies.", "Such programmes can significantly reduce the cost of innovation for firms, and risks for financiers and risk managers such as insurance providers.", "Malaysia also has in place welldeveloped institutions that can play a key role in partnership with financial institutions to support innovative financing solutions.", "These include the Credit Guarantee Corporation, Cagamas and SME Corporation.", "Second is the increasing opportunities presented for financial institutions to

standards and strong protections for intellectual property.", "The financial industry should organise itself to advance such efforts in coordination with professional bodies and authorities to open up wider avenues for financing innovative businesses in Malaysia.", "In the final analysis however, a larger role for financial institutions in financing growth and innovation demands a clear, strategic focus on enhancing the organisational capacity to promote innovation.", "It cannot be achieved with incidental measures and half steps.", "Financial institutions must be able to effectively mainstream innovation into their operations - across all parts of business, from developing innovative financial and risk management solutions, strengthening learning on innovation within the organisation and reviewing operational models and policies to support responsible practices that promote innovation.", "As earlier alluded to, the industry must also take a more active role in creating the conditions for innovative finance and insurance to be viable, working with legislators, policymakers, valuers and incubators.", "It is high time that the industry associations devote a sustained focus with dedicated resources to lead this effort.", "Innovations must be firmly anchored in a mentality that has the public interest in mind, and customers at the core.", "Just as innovation propels the financial sector forward, as custodians of public funds, it is trust and integrity that prevents a gulf from forming between finance and real value creation.", "This not only serves to build public confidence in the financial system, but places finance firmly back in service of society.", "We ought to aspire for the banking and insurance industry to be the pride of Malaysian, for its professionalism and integrity.", "If innovation is the source of future prosperity, then financial solutions that promote innovation must surely be its cradle.", "Over 120 years ago, Thomas Edison

conglomerates of our time.", "More currently, 18 banks and fund managers have invested USD170 million in Symphony, a secure messaging platform which is being touted as the \"Whatsapp\" of the financial world.", "Innovation such as this might or might not work but experimenting new solutions always involve risks and we have learnt that it is an imperative for any economy to grow to the next level of progress.", "Many other examples of our era exist - each one illustrating the promise of innovative industries that have the potential to create high-skill jobs and new economic opportunities that contribute to growth and development.", "Let this future finance conference serve as an opportunity for us to critically reflect on the actions that we can take individually and collectively to
