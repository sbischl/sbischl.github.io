which cannot be ruled out especially given the current historically low interest rates - there is a greater risk that attempts will be made to accommodate the nominal debt burden by pressuring the central bank into pursuing a laxer monetary policy, ie forcing it to forgo or postpone interest rate increases needed to ensure monetary stability.", "A credible monetary policy and the institutional independence of the ECB and the national central banks laid down in Article 108 of the EC Treaty undoubtedly provide a strong counterweight to such pressure.", "However, the Stability Pact was not aimed at combating an existing conflict between fiscal and monetary policy but rather - based on the wisdom of past political experience - was designed to prevent such a conflict from arising in the first place.", "Second: to avoid conflicts within monetary union.", "Before the start of monetary union, market forces were able to exercise a disciplinary effect on fiscal policy stances perceived to be unsound through corresponding exchange rate and interest rate responses.", "Although the market reactions often came relatively late and then overshot the mark, fiscal policy makers always had to reckon with sanctions of this kind from the market.", "In a monetary union, public sector borrowers can, for a time, hide some of the economic disadvantages resulting from an unsound fiscal policy under the blanket of monetary union or lessen the impact of market responses to such a policy by distributing them across the monetary union.", "Economists call this a fiscal externality, others talk of freeriding or moral hazard: countries with a sound fiscal policy that had to impose painful cutbacks on their citizens are forced to carry the can for less disciplined member states.", "In a nutshell: In a broad and liquid financial market, higher deficits of a specific country may have less impact on the interest rates : a stone causes greater waves when thrown into a garden pond than it does when thrown into a lake.", "Those of us who regard the long-term internal cohesion of monetary union and the avoidance of centrifugal forces as a matter of primary importance must therefore vehemently urge the member states to observe the fiscal policy rules.", "Third: the interrelationship between sound fiscal policy and growth.", "It is often maintained that government deficits - regardless of the initial debt level concerned - are always conducive to growth.", "However, a glance at the facts shows that low government debt has a positive correlation to growth because of the resultant boost in confidence, lower tax burden, greater involvement and efficiency of the private sector.", "Within European monetary union, this has been demonstrated in recent years by the example of countries such as Spain, Finland, Ireland and also Belgium, which has cut its high debt level (of more than 140% before the launch of monetary union) to approximately 96% (in 2004) and in recent years has recorded considerably higher growth rates than Germany, for example.", "Canada provides an interesting example outside the euro area.", "For the past seven years it has achieved budgetary surpluses and its growth rate has never fallen significantly below 2%.", "Leaving aside the debate about the so-called non-Keynesian effects of a fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits - which, by the way, also proved effective in Germany in the years following 1982 despite all the gloomy predictions made at the time that the country \"would save itself to death\" - it is widely accepted that a high debt level impairs the stabilising role of fiscal policy even in respect of short-term growth stimuli.", "This is because an expansionary fiscal policy has less impact in an environment of high deficit and debt levels than in an economy with structurally sound public finances.", "The marginal utility of short-term fiscal policy stimuli decreases as debt increases owing to economic agents' expectations of a later correction of the debt level and hence of the future burdens associated with all debt.", "Fourth: the need to tackle growing implicit government debt, in other words, the demographic burden resulting from ageing populations in western Europe.", "As studies by the Bundesbank and the German Council of Economic Experts have clearly shown16, in addition to the explicit government debt on which the public debate is focused, the impact of implicit promises of future state benefits from the social security systems should not be overlooked.", "For many member states, Germany in particular, these constitute a real problem in terms of the sustainability of public debt.", "The Bundesbank estimates that they have raised the long-term consolidation requirement to over 31\u20442% of GDP.", "Thus, a rule-based fiscal policy is also necessary out of fairness to future generations.", "In the language of public choice economists, the Stability Pact constitutes an insurance policy against the temptation for politicians to purchase votes today through high borrowing at the cost of future generations.", "Criteria for a viable fiscal framework on the basis of the former Stability Pact of 1997 In order to place those fiscal and economic objectives of the Stability Pact which I mentioned earlier on a viable operational footing, the fiscal framework must fulfil the following criteria.", "Simplicity, transparency and consistency -

the governments' medium-term stability programmes systematically overstated growth and hence budgetary developments, in other words, opportunities were overestimated and risks underestimated.", "Changes made to the Stability and Growth Pact in 2005 The changes were agreed on 23 March 2005 following a protracted political debate, coordination between the German and French governments and the active participation of the Luxembourg President of the EU Council Jean-Claude Juncker.", "They concern both the fundamental, \"preventive\" arm of the Stability Pact as defined in Council Regulation 1466/97 on the surveillance of budgetary positions, as well as the \"corrective\" arm laid down in Council Regulation 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the excessive deficit procedure.", "(1) In the \"preventive\" arm of the pact, the medium-term budgetary objective which previously applied to all member states (balanced budget or surplus) has been modified by country-specific considerations.", "Under Article 2a of the new Regulation, the medium-term budgetary objectives are to be set -
