about new technologies.", "This would help farmers to improve their productivity, earn more income and improve their standard of living.", "These agricultural extension services bring about changes in farmers attitude, knowledge and skills through education and communication.", "c) Focus to thrust areas: As mentioned in Prime Minister's Task Force Report (2010), to achieve all round development of

industrial estate in each block for MSMEs to facilitate setting up of new MSMEs in the region.", "(iii) Services sector: a) Eco and leisure tourism: State Governments should take effective steps to

financial inclusion initiatives in India, financial inclusion in NER consistently showed upward trends in terms of number of bank branches, credit and deposit growth.", "Further steps needed to speed-up the financial inclusion efforts in NER are: c) Increasing branch presence: In North-Eastern States and Sikkim, SCBs need to make cautious efforts to increase the number of branches.", "d) Villages covered: Since the number of villages covered accounted for only 4.4 per cent of total villages in NER, there is an urgent case for increasing banking footprints in the region.", "e) Intensive financial literacy and awareness campaign in vernacular languages in all the NER States is needed to mitigate risks posed by activities of unauthorised deposit collection by various methods by multiple agencies.", "This is especially important in NER, given the fact that, relatively speaking, there is higher number of instances of unauthorised deposit collection through various dubious means.", "f) Rural co-operative banks: The NER is having poor network of rural co-operatives.", "For effective financial inclusion, efforts may be initiated to increase the same in the region.", "g) NBFCs: There are around 108 NBFCs registered in the region.", "Of these 101 are registered in Assam state alone.", "Financial inclusion could be further deepened by opening of new NBFCs/opening branches of existing NBFCs.", "(iv) Caveats in the context of opening of accounts The financial institutions should generally in the context of opening accounts need to take effective steps to mitigate the following: The possibility of accounts being used as conduits for money laundering cannot be ruled out through a process known as \"Smurfing\", a process by which amounts are split below the threshold level of Rs.", "50,000/- to fly under the radar and thereby prevent detection.", "b) Accounts being used as money mules: Accounts of vulnerable individuals may be used by third parties to launder money is another possibility regarding which the banks should be careful of.", "c) Opening of multiple accounts: In the recent financial inclusion drive, multiple accounts have been opened by applicants in the hope that they would get an additional rupees one lakh insurance cover for every account so opened.", "However, if the applicants were to open different accounts in the same bank, using different documents like Aadhar Card, Pan Card, Passport etc., with slight variations in the manner in which their names are written, de-duplication may not be possible.", "The problem gets compounded if an applicant opens multiple accounts in different banks.", "Conclusion and way forward Let me conclude by repeating what I have endeavoured to convey about the role of financial sector in spurring growth and expanding financial inclusion in NER.", "I began with a brief introduction of the subject and provided the unique features of the NER.", "Thereafter, progress achieved in Financial Inclusion is discussed to assess where the NER stands at the present juncture.", "Trends in economic growth of NER were analyzed to indicate the performance of NER.", "Thereafter, the roles
