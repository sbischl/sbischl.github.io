the banking, insurance and securities industries - to ensure confidence in our financial system, \u2022 how we promote the development of a vibrant financial centre that serves a good part of Asia and in some respects the rest of the world, \u2022 how we also seek to ensure that the financial system serves the interests of consumers, and how we try to help Singaporeans manage their finances well.", "The MAS staff responsible for the Gallery have put a lot of thought into its design and content.", "But the Gallery will keep evolving, and we will want it to stay relevant to Singaporeans young and old.", "It is significant too that we are opening the Gallery in 2016, when we commemorate the 45th anniversary of the MAS.", "If we think about what we have achieved in these 45 years, what's most precious is credibility.", "Credibility is the most precious asset that a central bank and a financial regulator can have.", "The MAS' credibility was founded in its early years.", "I want to mention the leaders and staff who were involved in putting in placed these foundations of today's credibility.", "Mr Hon Sui Sen in particular, our first Chairman (1971-1980), Mr Michael Wong Pak-Shong, who was the Managing Director, and the staff at that time, including Mr Ng Kok Song, Mrs Ong-Ang Ai Boon, Mrs Elizabeth Sam.", "Together they built an organisation, bringing together no fewer than nine different offices and functions in Government at the time, melding them together in one organisation.", "They also set the foundations for an international financial centre.", "Singapore was not a serious financial centre until then.", "Mr Hon Sui Sen and his team built the foundation for a financial centre that went beyond Singapore.", "In Mr Hon's words, said back in 1972: \"In Asia, Singapore now offers the best prospects for developing into a financial centre, if not for the whole of Asia, at least beyond the Southeast Asian or ASEAN region.\"", "So it started then, and continued through the years when Dr Goh Keng Swee became Chairman (1980-85).", "But the most important development in this second phase, starting when Dr Goh led the MAS, was the re-orienting of our monetary policy to one centred on the S$ exchange rate.", "It was a novel policy at the time.", "We were one of the few central banks that managed monetary policy by focusing exclusively on the exchange rate.", "It was not conventional, but it has worked.", "Through that second phase in MAS' evolution, with Dr Goh as Chairman and subsequently under Dr Richard Hu's chairmanship (1985-1997), we built credibility in our exchange ratecentred monetary policy.", "We also built credibility as a no-nonsense financial regulator.", "That was a very important second phase, in the 1980s and 1990s.", "The third phase began when PM Lee Hsien Loong, then DPM, took over as Chairman of MAS (1997-2004), and continued through the years when ESM Goh was Chairman (2004- 2011).", "It involved liberalising and opening up our financial sector to greater competition, and at the same time developing further resilience in the system.", "This seemed a contradiction in terms to many countries -
