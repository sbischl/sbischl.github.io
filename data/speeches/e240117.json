21.", "In order to facilitate development of a robust market in credit risk transfer and greater investor participation in stressed loans, the Reserve Bank has put in place a regulatory framework in the form of guidelines on 'Securitisation of Standard Assets' and 'Transfer of Loan Exposures' (2021).", "Subsequently, a Discussion Paper has been issued on Framework for Securitizing Stressed Assets, the final contours of which are now being formulated.", "A core group of major banks has also been brought together to set up a self-regulatory body - Secondary Loan Market Association

Companies (NBFCs) and urban cooperative banks (UCBs).", "The emphasis is on identifying the root causes of vulnerabilities using a wide array of supervisory tools.", "Earlier, three separate units within the Reserve Bank were regulating and supervising three different types of entities in the banking sector, namely, the Scheduled Commercial Banks, the UCBs and the NBFCs.", "Now, only one department of regulation (DOR) regulates, while another department of supervision (DOS) supervises these three segments.", "This unified and harmonized approach has led to regulatory efficiency and effective oversight.", "It has enabled early and timely detection of cross-linkages across the sectors as well as synergy of regulatory and supervisory approaches.", "By no means, however, we have adopted a one-size-fits-all model.", "The rationale was to bring in an activity-based supervisory approach in addition to entity-based supervision.", "(b) On-Site Supervision 25.", "The frequency and intensity of on-site supervisory engagement is now based on the size as well as the riskiness of the institutions.", "These supervisions have also become more intense and frequent.", "We have

auditors by the Senior Supervisory Managers (SSMs).", "The focus is now more on identifying the root cause of vulnerabilities, rather than dealing with the symptoms alone.", "The priority areas are identified for each supervisory cycle.", "The underlying objective binding all these initiatives is to be proactive and ever vigilant in identifying and addressing emerging risks and vulnerabilities.", "The recent (November 16, 2023) pre-emptive increase in the risk weights for consumer credit and bank credit to NBFCs is an example of this approach.", "We have also buttressed the feedback loop between onsite examination and offsite analytics so as to have continuous supervision.", "(c) Offsite Supervision: Sharper Analytics 26.", "We have considerably strengthened supervisory macro and micro data analytics to capture potential and emerging risks.", "We deep dive into the business models of banks and other lending entities and closely monitor their asset liability mismatches and funding stability.", "We have a system of early warning signals that provide lead indications of risk build-up.", "While asset quality and capital position indicate resilience and robustness of financial institutions in the medium term, recent experience in certain advanced economies have shown that liquidity can become an immediate cause of crisis.", "We monitor liquidity position of banks and NBFCs very closely and aberrations, if any, are immediately taken up with them for remedial measures.", "Stress tests are also carried out on a continuous basis for both individual entities as well as at the systemic level.", "Thematic studies across entities are also undertaken.", "We do not interfere in the business decision making of regulated entities, but our approach is to sensitise their senior management for remedial action.", "In strengthening the offsite data analytics, models have been developed with suitable and judicious use of machine learning.", "The risk based supervisory rating models have been revised on the basis of feedback from external and internal experts.", "Thus, our whole approach to supervision is to be pro-active for minimising surprises, spotting concerns and addressing them early.", "(d) Sustained Focus on Capacity Building 27.", "As part of strengthening the Reserve Bank's supervision, a College of Supervisors (CoS) for capacity building has been set up in 2020.", "The College has joined the cohort of Global Institutions on Financial Resilience.", "We have collaborated with many international organisations such as

supervisors.", "(e) Enhanced Focus on IT and Cybersecurity Risks 28.", "Another area of our close attention is the cybersecurity risk.", "Although there are obvious benefits of adoption of IT in banking, the attendant risks need to be effectively addressed.", "Considering the diversification and complexity levels of our regulated and supervised entities, we have issued differentiated cybersecurity baseline control frameworks for the varied entities.", "For instance, a graded approach for the co-operative banks has been implemented, depending upon the digital services they offer.", "Guidelines have also been issued for robust governance structures, minimum security standards, IT and ITeS outsourcing, business continuity management, roles and functions of Chief Information Security Officers, among others.", "Inconclusion, I would like to say that the remarkable turnaround in the Indian banking system has been the cornerstone of India's success story in the recent years.", "Today, the Indian banking system is well-placed to support India's growth story in the years ahead.", "Trust is the essence of a robust financial system and is built over a period of time through sustained efforts.", "This needs to be preserved.", "The Reserve Bank has committed itself to safeguard the trust factor of the Indian financial system.", "Our recent efforts to improve regulation and supervision are guided by this basic principle.", "With our diverse responsibilities such as monetary authority, regulator and supervisor of banks and non-banks, payment systems, and
