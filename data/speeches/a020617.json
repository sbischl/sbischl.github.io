Bank of Canada's view of the economy.", "But first, I would like to address an important subject; that is, how to promote the efficient operation of Canada's financial markets.", "Rather than approaching this topic in a detailed, technical way, I want to speak about two qualities that are essential to their efficient operation: trust and transparency.", "Let me take a few minutes to describe why these qualities are important to the Bank.", "I think this can provide a good illustration as to why these same qualities are equally important for the private sector, particularly in light of Enron, and related questions about corporate practices.", "I will start with a quick definition of what I mean by trust.", "It's a term that's closely related to two other very important words: confidence and credibility.", "Trust, as I will use the term today, is more than a simple belief in something or someone without supporting evidence.", "Trust is what develops when a group of

struggling to come up with an appropriate anchor for monetary policy.", "However, in recent years, Canadians have gained confidence that we will keep inflation low, stable, and predictable, thanks to our system of explicit inflation targets and our success in meeting them.", "This trust can be thought of as a kind of social capital-a shared asset that benefits everyone, including the central bank.", "This capital is very valuable and must not be squandered.", "What does this have to do with efficiency?", "If you think back to the 1970s and 1980s, people spent a great deal of time and effort trying to hedge against inflation.", "Resources that should have been put to more productive uses were spent devising ways to protect the value of savings.", "Then, in 1991, the Government of Canada and the Bank agreed on a system of explicit inflationcontrol targets.", "As you may know, under the current agreement our target is the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent band for the

as well our eight fixed announcement dates each year, to share our thinking on the economy.", "We want Canadians to have a good grasp of what our goals are and of the framework we use to achieve those goals.", "Our explicit inflation target gives Canadians a yardstick for measuring how their central bank is doing.", "In our view, the less flexible the yardstick, the better.", "It is one thing to have a goal of \"low inflation\" or \"price stability.\"", "But the Bank and the Government of Canada agree that it is much more effective to have an explicit target for inflation so people know if we are meeting our commitment.", "So the result of all this effort at increased transparency is to give people a clear yardstick they can use to measure performance.", "All of this enhances the Bank's accountability and reinforces the trust we have fostered through inflation targeting.", "After all, it's a lot easier to have trust in an institution if it is open about its goals and strategies, and if it offers a clear way to measure its performance.", "Trust and the private sector This is relevant not just to central banks but to the entire business and financial community.", "Trustworthy business standards are one of the most important forms of social capital.", "Trust is paramount to the efficient operation of financial markets.", "And financial markets are a key ingredient of a well-functioning economy.", "This trust includes confidence in the players involved-the people who run the companies, and those who watch them.", "It also includes trust that the information required to make sound investment decisions is disclosed fully and accurately.", "Moreover, the disclosure must be fair-there must be confidence that insiders are not trading on information not available to everyone.", "Only when all these components of trust are in place can we have healthy, efficient financial markets that benefit everybody.", "Generally speaking, these components are in place in Canada.", "But the Enron collapse in the United States reminds us here that we cannot be complacent about our own situation.", "So what is lost when something like Enron occurs?", "Skepticism sets in about the truthfulness of routine financial disclosures.", "Companies find it more expensive to raise funds because once trust is broken, fewer investors are willing to participate, and those who remain demand a premium for the increased risk of being misled.", "A lack of reliable information also leads investors to make poor investment decisions, so capital is misallocated.", "In short, financial markets operate less efficiently, with fewer benefits for everyone.", "Avoiding a widespread loss of trust requires a systematic and coordinated effort to fix the flaws and weaknesses that can undermine investor confidence.", "It is important that there be a set of reasonable rules-so that chief executives, boards, and their auditors truly and fairly disclose the financial position of public companies-and that the investing public can rely on the truth, fairness, and completeness of that disclosure.", "Now, in spite of the specific flaws that the Enron collapse has revealed, it has become clear that much of the public's confidence in the efficient operation of financial markets remains intact.", "But we must continue to be vigilant.", "Restoring confidence Financial statements form the foundation on which financial markets operate.", "I have already spoken of the way that a clear yardstick has helped the Bank improve its transparency.", "The same idea holds true for

threatened by events like Enron, and by the suspicion that some insiders have been feathering their nests at the expense of shareholders.", "Obviously, it is wrong for analysts who actively own shares in a firm to use their assessments to promote that firm.", "But there can be more subtle conflicts of interest that don't involve illegal or fraudulent activity-for example, auditors who are not truly independent of the companies they audit.", "Risk assessment is another issue that needs more attention, particularly by companies outside the financial sector.", "This involves more than just listing in a financial filing all the things that could go wrong.", "Companies need to tell investors how they are handling both the external risks that they face and the risks they have chosen to take on as part of their business strategy.", "After all, investors are required to sign a form that tells their broker about their risk tolerance before they buy a stock.", "Surely then, the company issuing that stock should be able to give those investors some honest disclosure of their assessment of the risks involved in that investment.", "The fallout from Enron has prompted debate about the need for tougher financial market rules.", "If it is determined that new rules need to be written, they must not be picayune regulations that simply give the unscrupulous a roadmap to evade the spirit of the rules.", "It is the observance of the spirit as well as the letter of the regulations that we all must aspire to achieve.", "And when unscrupulous market participants or practices are revealed, authorities must come down on them with full force.", "To do otherwise is to do markets a disservice.", "Only strict reprobation will restore and maintain confidence that the rules are being enforced.", "Regulatory and supervisory bodies around the globe have begun to deal with the fallout from Enron and other high-profile bankruptcies.", "In the United States, the Financial Accounting

discipline.", "Corporate boards are re-examining their roles and taking a closer look at what is being done in their companies.", "Investors are demanding greater reconciliation between pro forma financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.", "Major firms, in response to those demands, are changing their corporate reporting methods.", "For example, some firms have announced plans to include, as an expense, the cost of executive stock options.", "And Standard and Poor's has introduced new benchmarks for reporting corporate earnings.", "Those changes aim to more accurately describe the revenues and costs associated with companies' primary businesses.", "We feel steps like these are helpful in advancing the debate about the most fair and accurate methods for reporting a company's true financial state.", "These are all positive examples of participants working together to enforce the spirit-not just the letter-of the rules under which financial markets operate.", "In the end, everyone needs to have trust in the financial markets-to know that the right rules are in place and that those rules are being enforced.", "We must continue to build on that social capital, to promote the efficient operation of financial markets, and the benefits that those markets can bring to everyone in society.", "The current outlook for the economy Now, I would like

higher level, than had been anticipated.", "And this means that it is moving towards full production capacity more quickly than we had expected.", "Core inflation has also been running slightly higher
