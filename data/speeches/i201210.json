lower than in 2019 and 2018.", "Public quasi-equity schemes will be necessary to support businesses, while ensuring that they remain selective by systematically involving private co-investors.", "However, we have every reason to believe that French financial institutions, even when faced with severe economic scenarios, will be sound enough to weather this crisis.", "Their profitability could be affected, but their solvency should remain sufficiently robust.", "This greater resilience can be attributed to two factors: their situation at the end of 2020 was better than expected, and above all, the crucial role played by public support mechanisms that have proven their effectiveness.", "It is therefore essential that these be extended for as long as the crisis continues.", "Beyond the crisis, addressing the right challenges This generally reassuring situation is obviously in no way a call for a \"status quo\".", "Banks and insurers are experiencing it: the Covid crisis is acting as an of their changes in response to the major structural challenges they are facing.", "However, we must not choose the wrong debate, or the wrong battle: the issue today is much less one of solvency than of the profitability of French financial institutions.", ".1 Putting into perspective the debate on solvency Many demands and even complaints from the financial sector are still focused - once again!", "- on solvency issues, and excessively so in my opinion.", "Let's start with the veiled criticism of Basel III.", "No one can seriously dispute the fact that the Basel rules have prevented the economic crisis from spiralling this time into a banking crisis this year.", "And, no one can seriously claim that they are hampering lending to businesses - which has risen by 13% over the past year - and in particular to SMEs - which is up 18%.", "So yes, France must remain committed to the full implementation of the Basel III agreement, which remains \"fair, reasonable and final\": fair in particular with regard to its consistent implementation in both the EU and the United States; reasonable with regard to the application in particular of the output floor; and final because there will not be a Basel IV.", "The fact that the implementation of the agreement has already been postponed by one year also demonstrates the Basel Committee's commitment to limiting the operational burden on banks.", "At the same time, active measures have been taken to enable them to use their capital and liquidity buffers to support the financing of the economy.", "Banks are invited to use this leeway as much and as long as necessary.", "It may seem paradoxical to ask for a hypothetical relaxation of Basel III, but not to use the real leeway that is available.", "To make it easier to use these measures, we supervisors need to be clear about the sufficiently long horizon for rebuilding these buffers once the crisis is over.", "Lastly, as regards dividends, I believe that it is necessary to be \"wise with sobriety\", to paraphrase Molie\u0300re.", "Undeniably, earmarking all earnings as reserves in 2020 was an effective measure to bolster solvency.", "However, there are now two arguments for moving towards a cautious distribution, the terms of which will require discussion.", "The first is the resilience of financial institutions to very large shocks, as illustrated by their situation at the end of 2020.", "The second, which is strategic in the current context, aims to preserve the attractiveness of financial institutions - and also insurance companies - for investors, which is essential for raising capital.", "Especially since most jurisdictions outside Europe seem to be moving towards a controlled liberalisation at least.", "As regards the solvency of insurers, we are making progress within EIOPA towards a compromise on the Unquestionably, and as the health crisis has review of Solvency II.", "confirmed, Solvency II has helped to safeguard the European insurance sector.", "At this stage, the review will have a neutral impact, without the interest rate shock, in terms of capital requirements and this is a good thing.", "Moreover, the schedule - as the review will enter into force in 2024 at the earliest - will give insurers precious time.", "They should make the most of this time to adapt their models to the changes related to the interest rate shock, and to take advantage of the major advances in the treatment of long-term investment.", ".2 The real challenge for banks is profitability I said it last May and I will say it even more clearly today: \"compared with US banks in particular, the French banking industry's profitability is neither excessive nor even adequate\".", "There are many reasons for this, which I will come back to later.", "But there is no doubt that the prolonged low interest rate environment has put pressure on the profitability of financial players.", "Acknowledging this is not to say low rates are a bad thing: they reflect long-term structural trends and are implemented for the common good.", "But acknowledging this means that it is necessary to adapt.", "Thus, since September 2019, the Governing Council has been able to offset the impact of low interest rates.", "This is the aim of the tiering mechanism, which reduces the annual cost of negative interest rates by over EUR 4 billion for European banks, of which around EUR 900 million for French institutions.", "In addition, the \"very favorable TLTRO borrowing rate (-1%), which is lower than the deposit rate (-0.5%) until June 2021, also has a very significant impact.", "But structural challenges will have to be met through the digitisation and consolidation strategies of the financial institutions themselves.", "The rapid digitisation of processes and networks generates crucial savings for the future, and is indispensable for customer loyalty, especially among the youngest customers.", "Efficiency also rests on the development of a true \"single banking market\".", "We have to speed up the creation of genuine pan-European banking groups capable of capitalising on their size, and generate economies of scale to cope specifically with these digital investments, which are fixed costs.", "The European financial sector is still too fragmented and vulnerable to asymmetric shocks.", "For insurers, the challenge of profitability in a low interest rate environment will inevitably involve adapting their business models: the combination of security, liquidity and returns - which has done so much for the success of the euro-denominated life insurance funds - is no longer sustainable.", "However, diversifying client assets into unit-linked products should not be the only or the best alternative: the insurance industry must rethink its product range.", "Less liquid, longer-term savings should combine a degree of capital protection with the higher return on stocks.", "In this context, the sector can assess its capacity to provide long-term capital support to viable companies weakened by the crisis.", "The PACTE law is an important step forward with the development of Eurocroissance and especially of retirement savings.", "And thanks to clear information on the overall cost of contracts, decisions on whether or not to take out a policy can be made on a fully informed basis.", "It is also important to ensure that management costs are monitored and transparent.", "The ACPR staff -
