pensions sectors of the financial system...we are also preparing to supervise five systemically important financial institutions (UTC, NIB, HMB, TTMF and ADB) as well as credit unions.", "That is a lot of power for a central bank.", "How do we wield such power?", "This brings me to our third story, which is about Bharat.", "As soon as the sad news of Dashrath's death reaches Bharat, he rushes back to Ayodhya.", "He reproaches his mother Kaikeyi for her wicked scheming ways and leaves for the forest in search of his brother Rama to offer him his rightful position as ruler of Ayodhya.", "So great was his devotion to Rama and so strong was his desire to be fair and just, that when Rama refused to return to Ayodhya before completing his fourteen years in exile, Bharat placed Rama's wooden sandals on the throne and ruled Ayodhya in the name of Rama - as Rama's emissary until Rama returned to regain his rightful position.", "Bharat's action, in my view, is one of the most powerful lessons in the Ramayana for those of us who serve in Government.", "Bharat was given the honour of ruling the mighty kingdom of Ayodhya.", "He could have just accepted the throne and the absolute power and luxury that came with it.", "But Bharat's sense of right and wrong would not permit him to eagerly accept what most others would greedily take.", "Instead, he ruled Ayodhya in Ram's name.", "As a central bank, we have the power to produce the public good called financial stability.", "Like Bharat, we recognize our power does not come from us, it comes from elsewhere.", "In the case of Bharat, his power and authority to rule Ayodhya came from Ram.", "In the case of Central Bank, our power and authority to manage the financial system comes from the people of Trinidad and Tobago.", "We seek to exercise this power in a fair and just manner, without regard to race, class or creed but to what actions are best for the overall health of Trinidad and Tobago's economy.", "In wielding this extensive power, what is our guide?", "What is our line in the sand?", "The This brings me to our fourth story... is the story of Lakshman.", "Soon after his birth, Lakshman kept crying until he was placed next to Ram.", "Since that day he was always beside Ram, accompanying him into exile in the forest.", "Such was his devotion to Ram that Lakshman even refused to sleep for fourteen years so that he could serve his brother, day and night.", "In the fourteenth year of exile, Sita sees a golden deer and pleads with Rama to capture it.", "Rama chases the deer into the forest, leaving Lakshman behind to watch over Sita.", "There is no sign of Rama.", "Afraid that a mishap might have befallen her husband, Sita forces Lakshman to go and look for Rama.", "Before setting out, Lakshman traces a line - the Lakshman Rekha - around the hermitage with an arrowhead.", "He warns Sita never to cross the line or let anyone in.", "No sooner does Lakshman leave than Ravan comes disguised as a beggar to the hermitage and asks Sita for food.", "Unaware of the devious plan of the beggar, Sita is tricked into crossing the Lakshman Rekha.", "To her horror, she discovers that the beggar is Ravan, king of the Rakshasas.", "Ravan grabs hold of Sita and forcibly carries her off to Lanka.", "The Lakshman Rekha separates civilization from the jungle.", "Within the Lakshman Rekha, Sita is Rama's wife.", "Outside, Sita is at Ravan's mercy.", "Central Bank's Lakshman Rekha is financial regulation.", "Within our Lakshman Rekha, our citizens have financial protection.", "Outside it, financial rakhshas are free to take away your wealth without mercy.", "The collapse of CLICO and the HCU some five years ago showed there were financial rakhshas who through greed and avarice tempted our citizens to step outside the Lakshman Rekha and took what was not theirs to take, just like Ravan took Sita.", "That is why today we are building an even stronger regulatory and supervisory financial perimeter...we are strengthening our own Lakshman Rekha to prevent a reoccurrence of financial crises.", "This brings us to the final and fifth story about Luv and Kush, the twin sons of Rama...the future.", "According to legend, during Ram's period of ruling Ayodhya, he yielded to negative public sentiment about Sita's purity and banished Sita into exile in the forest for a second time.", "Sage Valmiki provided shelter to a pregnant Sita in his ashram (hermitage) where she delivered twin sons named Luv and Kush.", "Sage Valmiki trained Luv and Kush to be masters in archery so that no one on earth could defeat them in war.", "He also taught them about divine and celestial warfare.", "Ram decided to perform Ashwamedha Yagna to enlarge his empire.", "The Ashwamedha Yagna is a ritual where an emperor sends out a horse accompanied by his army to various neighboring kingdoms.", "The local king has two options.", "He could either allow the horse to wander, signaling that his kingdom is annexed.", "Or, he could tie up the horse, indicating that he was ready to battle the emperor's army.", "The horse wandered into the forest where Luv and Kush lived and the twins tied up the horse, not knowing its significance.", "Ram sent Hanuman to retrieve the horse.", "Hanuman recognized Luv and Kush as the sons of Ram.", "He let them capture him and tie him up.", "Worried, Ram sent his brothers and his army to look for the horse.", "As they saw Hanuman tied up and Luv and Kush guarding him, they thought the two boys had stolen the horse.", "So Ram's brothers started attacking Luv and Kush who defeated them all.", "Eventually, Ram himself came to confront them in battle and eventually learned that Luv and Kush were his children.", "Once Sita witnessed the acceptance of her children by Ram, Sita sought final refuge in the arms of her mother Bhumi Devi (the goddess Earth), to receive her and as the ground opens, she vanishes into it.", "If you want to learn how it is Ram did not know he had these two powerful sons, then I encourage you to read the Ramayana.", "For me, Luv and Kush represent the future of central banking... a strong approach of specialized, skills that can take on any force.", "At Central Bank, we are building capacity in specialized skills such as anti-money laundering, actuarial science, cyber security and operational risk.", "Demand is also picking up for expert skills in strategic communications, international relations, and behavioral psychology.", "A decade ago, these skill sets were nowhere on the radar of Central Bank.", "Like Luv and Kush, our new breed of central bankers must not only come with specialized skills.", "Just like Luv and Kush, our new breed of central bankers must also come with the head and heart to ask the right questions, and the courage to look beyond the obvious to take on too-big-to fail entities like Ram's army.", "Here at the Central Bank, more than 15 percent of our new hires in the past two years have been in financial supervision, many with experience from the private sector.", "Another 10 per cent of new hires are in economic research.", "Like Luv and Kush, most of these new Central Bankers are young, but experienced thinkers who are prepared to serve their country.", "These are the five stories we have chosen to tell you this evening and while they are not traditional Divali stories, they come from the same source that gave birth to one commonly accepted story of Divali.", "Hopefully, you will leave here tonight with a greater appreciation as to why Hindus and non-Hindus remain so inspired by the epic story of the Ramayana.", "Let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family Shubh Divali.", "May your paths always be lit; may your minds always be illuminated.", "I hope you enjoy Paanch Kahani."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
