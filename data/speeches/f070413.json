local and international investors and other key stakeholders are paying close attention, and expect Development Bank of Zambia to deliver, and inescapably so, in terms of adherence to world class corporate governance standards and ensuring safe and sound operations.", "On these two responsibilities, I wish to remind Development Bank of Zambia board and management that the business world and stakeholders out there today do not hold two different sets of standards for effective corporate performance, a set for private sector businesses and another for state owned enterprises.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, we similarly welcome the role of financial advisors and intermediaries such as Standard Chartered played in bringing to market of this initiative.", "Their participation brought international best practice and standards to this landmark transaction which we expect will have a developmental impact on the local bond market.", "It is also our expectation that other intermediaries will look to this initiative to motivate them to seek to do more in this area for the benefit of our economy.", "So, in conclusion, what we as Bank of Zambia can do is to understand the dynamics of the debt market, how it is evolving, and whether it is sufficiently liquid and transparent.", "We can also help ensure that banks perform their proper role and enhance the price discovery process by promoting transparency in the conduct of our own monetary policy actions.", "Finally, and most importantly, we can strive to help create conditions in our economy that will support sustainable, non-inflationary growth and so promote the overall welfare of all citizens.", "It is this is a role that the Bank of Zambia is committed to playing effectively.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, with these remarks, I wish to thank all stakeholders in this important initiative."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["local bond market", "corporate governance", "price discovery", "financial system stability", "monetary policy", "non-inflationary growth", "international best practice", "development of the local bond market", "securities markets", "banks"]}
