that global economic recovery is ongoing, but at an unexpected and unequal speed.", "Such dynamics transforming into global pressure become more apparent when world's commodity prices keep decreasing

through preparation of national and regional financial balance sheet, application of bank capital components in the form of Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCB), and improvement of RR-LDR provisions.", "Furthermore, macroprudential policy direction is implemented through the adoption of incentive/disincentive mechanism to boost quality MSME credit extension and strengthen the legal

system.", "Bank Indonesia, OJK, and the Government must also seek to increase stability and resilience in sharia finance.", "It is conducted among others through development of sharia finance instruments, Sukuk market deepening, and enabling regulation formulation.", "We must also be alert to the constellation of global monetary policies, where divergence occurs in monetary policies of the
