b) Appointing Investec Securities Proprietary Limited to act as an independent broker to facilitate the disposal of those shares over a period of two years from the date of the order, at a sale price of not less than a pre-determined market price; and c) Directed the General Counsel of the SARB to do all things necessary to enable the sale of the shares, including signing all necessary documentation and providing whatever assistance is necessary to Investec Securities Proprietary Limited.", "As a result of this process, some 149 200 shares in the SARB have become available for sale.", "We would like to use this opportunity to diversify our shareholder base, and we would like to encourage all eligible South Africans to take up this opportunity to own shares in the SARB.", "Any person is eligible to buy shares in the SARB, except if they already hold, together with their associates, 10 000 of these shares.", "I must emphasise that the SARB does not have a profit-maximising objective;
