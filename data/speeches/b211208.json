prices one should distinguish something driven by real forces (in this case stronger demand for goods and impairments to supply) from a purely monetary increase.", "In theory, a rise in inflation in our trading partners driven purely by looser monetary policy would not have the same impact because it would be offset by a strengthening of sterling's exchange rate.", "The impact on inflation of a period of slower productivity growth depends on what it does to demand and on how easily wage growth falls in response.", "If people recognise the drop in productivity growth, and demand growth falls alongside it, and/or if nominal wage growth is reasonably flexible and can accommodate the decline in the warranted real wage without unemployment having to rise, it needn't result in higher
