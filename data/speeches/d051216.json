range of products and services, a far more competitive financial services industry and more complex financial transactions.", "It is the demands of this new environment that has created a greater need for financial literacy to not only ensure the efficient functioning of the financial system but also enhance the potential for the economy to prosper and thrive.", "This evening, I would like to focus on financial literacy from the perspective of the Central Bank, given that the function of the Central Bank has widespread implications on financial markets, businesses and the public as large.", "The main responsibilities of the Central Bank includes the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, ensuring the soundness and stability of the banking system, and finally ensuring the integrity and reliability of the payments systems.", "In all these areas, the actions of the Central Bank have direct implications on the business community and the public at large.", "The ultimate aim of the

borrowing, is the reliance for financing from the informal financial sector.", "Very often such type of predatory lending results in perpetual debt since the interest rate is prohibitively high, and

it attracts lower costs, increased convenience and a higher level of security.", "In promoting financial literacy, several issues need to be addressed.", "One of the most critical issues is the apathy towards information.", "Irrational behavior, the inability to comprehend complex information, the perception that information is unreliable, or more often than not the reluctance to invest the time to study the information, are all reasons that increase such apathy.", "In addressing financial literacy, the information provided to consumers needs to be simple, brief, contextualised to the needs of the consumer and delivered at the right time.", "An example is providing special, inclusive programmes for financially excluded groups that are at different levels of development and that face

responsibility in helping consumers manage their financial risks more effectively.", "In this regard, the financial institutions who are the first line of contact with consumers, and who bear a major
