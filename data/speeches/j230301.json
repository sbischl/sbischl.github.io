that is, compared with their pre-pandemic level.", "Main reason for the current decline in total assets on the assets side of the balance sheet: lending related to monetary policy operations, which declined by \u20ac184 billion primarily due to the repayment of the TLTRO III longer-term refinancing operations, which had particularly favourable interest rates for credit institutions during the pandemic.", "By contrast, euro-denominated securities under the monetary policy purchase programmes grew again, by \u20ac45 billion, particularly on account of the PSPP and PEPP government bond purchases in the first half of the year.", "Another factor driving balance sheet growth in the two previous years was liquidity inflows from other European countries.", "In 2022, growth in the TARGET2 claim on the ECB came almost to a standstill.", "The increase amounts to \u20ac8 billion, and the claim as at the reporting date came to a total of \u20ac1,269 billion, which is very close to the record level of \u20ac1,277 billion recorded on 29 December 2022.", "On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, deposits declined significantly last year.", "Euro-denominated balances of domestic and foreign depositors reported in liability items 3, 4 and 5 shrank on the year, declining by 27%, or \u20ac198 billion, to \u20ac533 billion on the back of smaller general government and foreign central bank holdings.", "By contrast, liabilities related to monetary policy operations increased by \u20ac62 billion to \u20ac1,200 billion - that's around 5% up on the end of 2021.", "Just under one-third (30%) of all deposits of credit institutions throughout the Eurosystem are held with the Bundesbank.", "The volume of banknotes put into circulation by the Bundesbank rose further, climbing by \u20ac16 billion to \u20ac900 billion, an increase of 2%.", "The revaluation accounts are also worth taking a look at.", "This item increased by \u20ac11 billion year on year to \u20ac182 billion.", "A breakdown of the revaluation items can be seen on slide 14.", "The revaluation reserve for gold rose by \u20ac10.2 billion to \u20ac176.1 billion.", "The price of gold in US dollars as at the reporting date was down slightly on the previous year's price, but the stronger US dollar meant that the price of gold in euro was 6% up on the year.", "Viewed over the long term, there is still a sustained marked increase in the revaluation reserve for gold.", "Compared with its starting balance at the launch of monetary union (\u20ac21 billion), this revaluation reserve, with its current balance of \u20ac176.1 billion, is eight times as large as it was at the start of 1999.", "The revaluation reserves for foreign currencies grew by \u20ac1 billion on the year because of the weaker euro, with the US dollar being mainly responsible for this growth.", "Profit and loss account As Bundesbank President Dr Joachim Nagel has already mentioned, the Bundesbank's profitability in 2022 was far less favourable overall than in the previous year.", "The turnaround in interest rates has set a great many things in motion.", "At the Bundesbank, the interest rate hikes are reflected on both sides of the balance sheet.", "In a structure that is as complex and highly interwoven as a central bank, their impact fundamentally transforms many components.", "Our profit and loss account for 2022 bears testament to this complexity.", "The slide on the profit and loss account provides an overview (slide 15): The largest component of the profit and loss account is net interest income (column 1), which recorded a \u20ac1.5 billion increase from \u20ac2.5 billion to \u20ac4.0 billion.", "Net interest income in foreign currency rose by \u20ac0.5 billion on the back of rising US dollar yields.", "Net interest income in euro grew by \u20ac1.0 billion on the year.", "This was due to higher interest income from securities portfolios held for monetary policy purposes - particularly from inflation-linked Federal bonds, relief provided by the suspension of the two-tier remuneration system and the expiry of the special interest rate period for TLTRO III operations.", "These positive effects were offset to a degree by the rise in the deposit facility rate (this affects balances held by credit institutions and other domestic and foreign depositors) and by the (average) interest rate on TLTRO III operations (up to 22 November 2022).", "It is also worth mentioning in this regard that the rise in key interest rates means that - for the first time since 2016 - interest income is being generated again from the TARGET2 balance of \u20ac7,298 million (interest paid at the MRO rate).", "Interest income from monetary policy portfolios rose on balance by \u20ac2,687 million (from \u20ac101 million to \u20ac2,788 million): inflation-linked bonds generated interest income totalling \u20ac3,074 million, compared with \u20ac768 million in the previous year.", "Realised gains from financial operations and write-downs related to foreign exchange and securities (column 2) are \u20ac1.1 billion lower than in the previous year.", "Realised gains /losses decreased on balance by \u20ac376 million to \u20ac2 million due to rising capital market yields.", "Write-downs of \u20ac922 million were recorded (2021: \u20ac161 million), especially on Treasury notes (owing to the increase in US$ capital market yields).", "Income from participating interests (column 3) fell by \u20ac144 million to \u20ac28 million in 2022 owing to the lack of profit distribution from the ECB.", "The negative impact of the net result of pooling of monetary income (column 4) increased by \u20ac1.0 billion to -\u20ac2.2 billion, mainly owing to the low remuneration on the monetary policy holdings of supranational securities, which the Bundesbank itself does not hold.", "Other income (column 5) decreased by \u20ac1.4 billion owing to a one-off effect in the previous year when other income increased by \u20ac1.3 billion owing to the partial derecognition of Deutsche Mark banknotes of the BBk III/IIIa series.", "Administrative expenditure, which is summarised in the next column, i.e.", "the Bundesbank's staff costs and administrative expenses as well as the remaining expense items (column 6), is virtually unchanged on the year.", "To offset the accumulated losses, the provisions for general risks (column 7) were reduced by \u20ac972 million (2021: increased by \u20ac1,346 million) to \u20ac19.2 billion.", "The yearon-year change of \u20ac2.3 billion shown on this slide is a net figure combining the increase in the previous year and the release in 2022.", "As in the previous year, the profit and loss account for financial year 2022 closed with a balanced result -
