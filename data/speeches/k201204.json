recent work we were tasked with both building and operating new means of implementing monetary policy.", "Our goals remained the same, our tools evolved.", "In hindsight, the development of new monetary policy tools was simple, not easy.", "It is the communication challenges with our stakeholders and broader public that remains work in progress.", "As is the case internationally, central bankers must continually explain what they do that is, where the limitations of monetary policy rest.", "I will conclude by outlining the work we have ahead of us on communication and research, so as to best ensure that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand remains effective and well understood.", "Current Economic Environment The recent news of the efficacy of several trial vaccines aside, the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 induced recession continues to be highly variable.", "To date, in New Zealand, the impact of the pandemic has been less dramatic than some of the extreme scenarios we envisaged as recently as April 2020.", "However, we still faced a historically large loss in output and employment during the year, with very uneven effects across industries, employment, and demographic and regional groups (Figure 1).", "Following the initial containment of the virus and the lifting of social restrictions in New Zealand there has been a rebound in domestic spending underway.", "Considerable economic uncertainty remains, however, with business investment lagging and significant segments of economic activity stagnant.", "Until the scientific and distribution solutions for the vaccines are resolved and implemented, we continue to operate in an environment of uncertainty.", "It is still assumed by policy makers internationally that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be long and variable.", "As such, we need to retain a medium-term focus on our efforts, beyond the immediate bounce back in spending that monetary and fiscal policy have provided.", "Outlined in our most recent Monetary Policy Statement is our view that economic risks are still skewed to the downside.", "This of course does not rule out upside scenarios; it is more a statement of relative risks.", "What we are observing internationally, and here in New Zealand, is a scarring on the economy reduced businesses' from the impact of COVID-19.", "Pervasive uncertainty has dramatically preparedness to invest and employ.", "And, we observe unemployment rising at the same time as increased skill shortages.", "Redeploying labour is not a straightforward activity.",

'staycations' as a for international travel; relaxing in our own backyard (Figure 4).", "Demand for New Zealand's education and tourism services is being significantly by fewer international arrivals.", "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, international tourism and education accounted for around 6 percent of nominal GDP.", "Receipts from these and other services fell 40 percent in the June quarter 2020, and are only being partially offset by increased local spending.", "This spending weakness will affect incomes in the wider economy for years to come.", "An early taste of this will occur in early 2021, when the seasonal influx of international tourists fails to show up at our doorstep.", "Monetary Policy Statement November 2020 While there are significant areas of economic

global economic recovery remains in question.", "Our Policy Response to COVID-19 the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), when confronted with the COVID-19 facts, was quick to significantly ease monetary conditions i.e., lower interest rates.", "It was very clear that the virus posed a significant negative economic shock.", "The Committee's \"least regrets\" approach to policy meant it was better to risk doing too much too soon, than too little too late when it came to easing policy.", "The scale and duration of the COVID-19 economic shock was unprecedented and unknown.", "We were not alone in this action.", "Globally, monetary and financial stability policy responses, and fiscal expansion policies, were quickly put to work collaboratively to provide economic support.", "Across the OECD countries the adopted policies were all broadly similar, including some combination of: ensuring credit and cash is appropriately affordable and accessible, increased government spending and investment, support for employers to retain their employees and access credit, and enhanced health and economic welfare support.", "All countries designed their policy responses for their local conditions, commencing with the tools that were most operationally ready to deploy.", "While the front-line economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic is fiscal policy, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand provided significant assistance by ensuring interest rates were reduced to a level consistent with maintaining low and stable inflation, and contributing to maximum sustainable employment.", "Consistent with our dual monetary policy mandate and our financial stability mandate, we acted to support economic and financial activity.", "Our actions included: Instigating a significant reduction in retail interest rates; Ensuring there was ample liquidity for the banking system; \uf0b7 of New Zealand's Supporting the functioning foreign exchange and debt markets; Bolstering community access to cash; and Facilitating a variety of Government and industry-led initiatives to allow the financial sector to remain customer-focused.", "On the latter, the Reserve Bank worked with the Government

"we would need to use this playbook.", "And, as in many other OECD countries, we ended up with two jobs to do simultaneously: building and operating new monetary policy tools to achieve our desired monetary conditions.", "This multi-tasking has proved more of a communication challenge than an engineering one.", "We were quick to lower the OCR to 0.25 per cent and commit publicly that it would remain at this level for at least a year.", "However, we also committed our local banks to ensuring they would be operationally ready to manage negative wholesale interest rates by the end of this period.", "We wanted to provide some immediate certainty to the public about the path of the OCR while also creating future policy optionality the right but not the obligation to implement a negative OCR if future conditions necessitated this.", "We remain true to these commitments.", "We subsequently implemented a Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programme aimed at lowering and flattening the New Zealand wholesale interest rate curve.", "The purpose of this was to drive retail interest rates lower, to be consistent with our dual monetary policy mandate.", "This action has proved effective

costs should embed the retail borrowing and lending costs we need to be successful.", "Our communication challenge remains ongoing despite the successful implementation of these new monetary policy tools.", "We share this challenge with other central banks.", "The impact of the LSAP and FLP on the government's balance sheet differ to that of moving the OCR up and down to implement monetary

keep annual consumer price inflation between 1-3 percent and support maximum sustainable employment.", "The Government, meanwhile, continues to finance its spending through the issue of fixed term interest bearing government bonds.", "Monetary financing, by contrast, occurs when government spending is financed by a central bank being instructed to issue irredeemable fiat non-interest bearing liabilities to the Bank's mandate and is unrelated to the Government.", "This activity sits outside of the Reserve Bank's inflation and employment remit.", "Our new tools remain purely for the purpose of ensuring interest rates in New Zealand are consistent with achieving our mandate.", "The LSAP and FLP instruments like the OCR can be altered to achieve our legislated purpose.", "Their design and implementation remain at the call of the Monetary Policy Committee.", "Many other central banks have taken similar approaches in dealing with impact of COVID-19, albeit starting from a different market structure.", "For instance, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of New Zealand have now both entered large-scale asset purchases and funding for lending programmes.", "We have also both provided significant liquidity to the financial markets to ensure orderly functioning.", "And we have both reduced the OCR to a rate near zero, with forward signalling data dependent.", "Another common theme in New Zealand, the UK, Australia, Canada and the United States has been the pros and cons of using negative official interest rates (e.g., a negative OCR) relative to other monetary instruments.", "We focused on being operationally ready to implement a negative OCR if necessary.", "Its actual use will always depend on the economic context at the time, and its relative efficacy.", "Selecting the appropriate policy mix The past few months have shown remarkable adaptability and resilience by policymakers internationally, and in New Zealand.", "As is appropriate, starring in the times of COVID-19 have been health, fiscal, and regulatory policy responses.", "When economic confidence is low, governments are able to directly spend and invest, and ensure that economic resources are mobilised and redeployed.", "In New Zealand, the Government has supported households and businesses directly by helping people maintain access to credit and cash flow through business credit schemes and income support and assisting ongoing employment via wage subsidies (Figures 9, 10).", "Our research suggests that the Government's wage subsidy scheme significantly improved job retention by approximately 2.5% of the total labour force.", "The scheme also most Monetary Policy in 2020, Debelle, G., Speech to the Australian Business Economists Webinar, November 2020, -dg-2020-11-24.html

Connectedness Overall, to date, the New Zealand labour market has proved relatively resilient to the both the Government's fiscal COVID19 economic shock.", "This positive outcome can be explained by measures and other factors such as:15 Labour shortage existed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak; Domestic spending resumed rapidly after social restrictions were eased, suggesting that a critical mass of New Zealanders were sound financially; and Businesses favoured reducing the paid hours worked, rather than reducing the numbers employed, due to the temporary nature of the lockdowns (Figure 11).", "The easing in monetary conditions also had a significant role to play in retaining jobs.", "When setting monetary conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee was kept aware of the Government's fiscal policies' purposes and desired impacts.", "We were thus able to calibrate our response appropriately.", "The most recent New Zealand data shows annual consumer price inflation currently at 1.4% (compared to our 1-3% target range) and the unemployment rate is at 5.3% (above our estimate consistent with maximum sustainable employment).", "We estimate that in the absence of our recent monetary policy actions, unemployment would be higher still (nearer 6.0%), inflation expectations would have continued to decline, and the New Zealand dollar trade-weighted exchange rate would have risen by around 7%.", "In other words, monetary policy has been effective to date in supporting both inflation and employment as intended at least at the aggregate level.", "Drawing on internal RBNZ analysis,
