a responsive policy and regulatory environment as well as a clear strategy with implementing plans.", "At the BSP we have steadily reinforced these narratives with data and evidence.", "We accumulate data through demand-side surveys, information sharing agreement with other government institutions, and reportorial requirements from our supervised institutions.", "Insights derived from these information help us shape more responsive and more effective policies.", "For instance, the Bangko Sentral fostered the creation of scaled-down or microbanking offices to provide unserved municipalities access to banking services.", "We recognized that smaller markets do not justify the cost of setting up regular bank offices.", "Today, we have 540 micro-banking offices, over 12% of which are in areas with no other bank presence.", "Indeed, we consult our stakeholders to improve our regulations.", "Our microfinance regulations are a case in point.", "Recognizing the peculiarities of microfinance, we provided incentives such as branching liberalization and documentary exemptions while instilling clear prudential and conduct standards to mitigate risks and maintain alignment with international standards.", "Today, we have a robust and active microfinance industry in the Philippines.", "Initiatives and Gaps Traversing the road toward a culture of inquiry and evidence is challenging but worth the effort.", "In the past, we did not have a repository of financial inclusion information and data.", "There was a dearth in demand-side data.", "Keeping in mind the principles of inquiry and evidence, the BSP introduced measures to bolster its data and measurement frameworks.", "These include: \u2022 The creation of a Data and Measurement Group within the BSP's Inclusive Finance Steering Committee (IFSC) to ensure a coordinated focus in pursuing programs supportive of financial inclusion.", "Among others, it oversees the institutionalization of information sharing within the BSP and other agencies \u2022 The creation of a supply-side financial inclusion database and library to be maintained and updated by a dedicated team of data analysts from the BSP's Inclusive Finance Advocacy Office.", "\u2022 The roll out of the National Baseline Survey on Financial Inclusion (NBSFI).", "This is the first national survey of individuals that measures baseline dimensions of inclusive products and services from the perspective of users of financial products and services.", "The survey help provide a more holistic picture of financial inclusion and facilitates identification of barriers, crafting evidence-based policies and the setting of targets.", "The importance we ascribe to data and measurement is underscored by the simultaneous launch of our maiden baseline survey with our National Strategy for Financial Inclusion.", "Completed last year, the baseline survey showed the following results: \u2022 25% of Filipino adults have never saved, 32% used to save, and only 43 % presently have savings.", "\u2022 Of those with savings, only 32% save in banks while 68 % keep their savings at home.", "\u2022 65 % of unbanked adults cited lack of money as the main reason for not having a bank account.", "About 47 % of adults have outstanding loans.", "The main source of borrowing is informal - 62% borrow from family, relatives or friends while 10% borrow from informal lenders.", "The survey indicates the many challenges we face moving forward.", "For service providers, the survey reveals that there are plenty of opportunities for those looking to expand their business or to introduce game-changing innovations.", "And we continue to push forward.", "We are now in the process of building a monitoring and evaluation framework for our National Strategy for Financial Inclusion.", "Among others, we need to consider the different levels of technology across member-agencies of our Steering Committee; distill the results of our National Baseline Survey on Financial Inclusion to yield focused studies; and take deeper dives into focus areas to deepen our understanding of the environment and its needs.", "We are encouraged that even as we address the gaps in data and measurement, we continue to see gains in our financial inclusion programs.", "For your information, the Philippines has been ranked by the Economic Intelligence Unit as the top country in Asia with the most conducive environment for financial inclusion.", "A paradigm shift in the way we pursue financial inclusion may be just what we need to propel us forward in a major way.", "We need to constantly measure how we are doing through evidence-based surveys and studies to ensure that we are on the right track and that we are not wasting time and resources.", "We need to develop an evidence-based mindset to continuously enrich our knowledge base and become more effective agents of financial inclusion programs that improve lives and liberate people from poverty.", "I wish therefore that our workshop on Evidence in Financial Inclusion will be successful and fruitful, and generate innovative programs to address poverty in our country and other parts of the world.", "Finally, on behalf of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we thank IPA our co-host, Citibank, all our resource persons and workshop participants for joining us today.", "Thank you all and Mabuhay!"], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination", "monetary-financial coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Financial inclusion", "Poverty alleviation", "Evidence-based mindset", "Data and measurement", "National Strategy for Financial Inclusion", "Microfinance", "Barriers to financial inclusion", "Financial literacy", "Narrative", "Innovations for Poverty Action"]}
