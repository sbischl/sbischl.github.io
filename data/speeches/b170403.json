end of 2016.", "In concrete terms, the Albanian economy has accelerated the growth pace driven mainly by the accommodative monetary policy of the Bank of Albania and its effective pass-through to the economy.", "These factors, coupled with the further recovery of domestic demand will play a significant role in the further growth of economic activity during The Report points to the important fact

the banking system are paying particular attention to these two topics.", "Our financial education programmes, informative publications on banking products and services, coupled with regulation,

all groups of the society.", "The Bank of Albania deems that more may be done with regard to designing and promoting financial products that satisfy better the needs of such groups.", "In addition, we think that there is more space for faster growth of credit to the private sector, particularly for certain sectors, in which inequality is more notable.", "More concretely, agriculture is a good example to illustrate this point.", "While it contributes a significant share to the gross national product, it only gets a small share of credit and other financial products.", "Beyond these policies

designed in the framework of the European integration process.", "The priorities of our economies should focus on maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability, continuing structural reforms in
