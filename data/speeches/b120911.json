financial system was in free fall.", "In \"Too Big To Fail\", Andrew Ross Sorkin, the award-winning New York Times columnist, provides a blowby-blow inside story of how Wall Street and Washington fought to save the financial system - and to save themselves.", "It is a cautionary tale for decades to come.", "This true story is not only about financial institutions that were too big to fail -

challenges to global financial stability occupying the world's attention four years after the free fall of the U.S. financial system; Second, current financial stability issues in Trinidad and Tobago,

cliff, the political brinkmanship - reminiscent of the August 2011 discussions on raising the US debt ceiling - suggest that a compromise may be difficult to reach in an election year.", "Beyond these concerns, I would mention two other growing dangers to the global financial system.", "First, emerging market economies have not escaped contagion.", "Growth prospects in a few large emerging market

must be mindful of the challenges that the turbulent global economic environment poses and while our focus is growth, we must recognize the need for financial discipline.", "As I indicated before, Trinidad and Tobago has not been immune from severe threats to financial stability, arising from the global financial crisis, the CL Financial debacle, and the prolonged domestic economic slowdown which started in 2009.", "Notwithstanding these difficulties, banks which dominate the financial system in Trinidad and Tobago remain very well capitalized even during the crisis.", "As at March 2012, commercial banks' regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets stood at over 25 percent from 20 percent in 2009, and well above the statutory minimum requirement of 8 percent.", "These capital adequacy

March 2012.", "Notwithstanding the low interest rate environment, banks have successfully managed both their net interest margin positions and operating expenses, which supported profitability through the slowdown in economic activity, the fall in real estate prices and the difficulties of CLICO that required extra provisioning by some banks.", "Commercial banks' profitability ratios were, on average, much lower than in previous years, but were still quite strong by regional and international standards.", "While the direct exposure of local banks to foreign markets is low in relation to

general insurance companies have been ceding a significant portion of their insurance business to international re-insurers in order to mitigate very large claims arising from natural disaster risk.", "Some small insurance companies specializing in third party motor insurance appear undercapitalized.", "In addition to poor market conduct, third party motor insurers engage in non-payment and under-reserving of claims.", "It is instructive to note that the Central Bank intervened to close one motor insurer in 2010, after addressing insolvencies in the previous years, and has issued compliance directions to several companies.", "Unless these smaller general insurance companies improve their pricing and capital positions, the Central Bank is likely to undertake further interventions in this part of the insurance sector.", "The Insurance Act requires insurance companies to maintain assets in their Statutory Fund to cover liabilities for policies owned by residents of

Bank is prepared to take early and decisive corrective actions to prevent a build-up of unmitigated risks in individual financial institutions, or in the financial system as a whole.", "There are

details on key initiatives.", "Following CLICO's failure, the Central Bank has made considerable progress in strengthening the regulatory framework for insurance.", "The current Insurance Act dates back to 1980 and is not designed to adequately address the types of risks that are inherent in the current suite of products and services provided by insurers today.", "A new Insurance Bill has been drafted following extensive consultations with the industry and is waiting to be laid in Parliament, which is expected to re-open this month.", "The proposed Insurance Bill contains a modern approach to insurance regulation and supervision, strengthening corporate governance of insurance companies, and establishing more effective protection of policyholders.", "It will address fundamental prudential deficiencies and will include the following important requirements for insurance companies which are consistent with international best practice: Implementation of a new actuarial valuation methodology; Implementation of a risk-based capital regime; and Implementation of a stress testing regime.", "Like the insurance industry, the credit union sector has operated within a legislative framework that is outdated.", "The present legislation covering the credit union movement (the Co-operative Society Act) dates back to 1971 and does not deal with prudential issues.", "The case for stricter regulation of the credit union sector could not be more compelling.", "Credit unions account for more than 5 percent of total financial system assets, and have an extensive service foot

significant proportion of the assets of the financial system.", "Last month, the Central Bank issued a revised Policy Proposal Document for the Establishment of an Occupational Pension Plans Bill for further review and comment.", "The revised document takes into consideration the numerous comments received on previous drafts and incorporates notable revisions to the proposals in key areas such as: Rights of pension plan members and beneficiaries; Governance of pension plans; and Winding up of pension plans.", "We plan to lay the Occupational Pension Plans Bill in Parliament in the first quarter of 2014.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, some financial institutions outside of the banking and insurance sectors can be considered systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).", "The size, complexity and inter-linkages with other financial institutions and markets mean that SIFIs are too important to fail, or ignore.", "In Trinidad and Tobago, we have identified three additional SIFIs - the Unit Trust Corporation (UTC), the National Insurance Board (NIB), and the Home Mortgage Bank (HMB).", "The UTC holds more than one-tenth of the assets of the financial system.", "It is the country's largest mutual funds provider, provides a full range of investment services and competes with not only investment banks, but also - at least according to public perception - with commercial banks.", "The state-owned National Insurance Board (NIB), which is responsible for the national pension system, commands about one-fifth of the assets of the financial system.", "As the major shareholder of the Home Mortgage Bank (HMB), the Trinidad and Tobago Mortgage Finance Company (TTMF) and NIPDEC, NIB plays an exceptionally prominent role in the domestic economy and financial market.", "Although the Home Mortgage Bank is the smallest in the SIFI group, it is the only institution responsible for providing secondary mortgage financing.", "The Financial Stability Board, which has been at the forefront of discussions on global financial regulatory reform, has proposed stronger regulatory, supervisory and resolution frameworks for SIFIs.", "The elements of an adequate SIFI policy framework include the following components: 1.", "More stringent capital (possibly liquidity) requirements to limit contribution to 2.", "Proactive and intense supervision consistent with the complexity and riskiness of the 3.", "Enhanced transparency and disclosure requirements to improve market discipline 4.", "An effective resolution regime to enhance orderly recovery and wind-down in the event of failure, including developing living wills or recovery plans; and 5.", "Equitable burden sharing with the private sector to internalize costs by creditors and shareholders.", "The supervision of SIFIs must be fully encompassed and at the Central Bank, we are considering the scope of such regulation for the local institutions.", "Ladies and Gentlemen, financial stability requires active and competent supervision.", "The Central Bank currently supervises the following entities: 25 banks and non-banks 6 active life insurance companies 16 active general insurance companies 9 active composite insurance companies (including CLICO and BAT) 256 active pension plans And, as I indicated, the Bank intends to supervise some 100 active credit unions and consider the supervision of SIFIs not under its current purview.", "It is clear that to effectively deliver on its challenging but crucial regulatory reform agenda, the Central Bank must strengthen its supervisory capacity.", "The IMF's May 2010 Staff Position Note \"The Making of Good Supervision: Learning to Say No\" is what I consider a seminal piece of work on the future of financial supervision.", "It is a must read for Central Bankers.", "The paper focuses on the lessons drawn from failures in supervision during the global financial crisis that may help prevent future crises.", "The paper identifies 5 key elements of good supervision, all of which will inform how the function of supervision at the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago will adapt to the new regulatory framework.", "These five elements and their application to the Central Bank are as follows: 1.", "Supervisors must not stay on the sidelines of regulated financial institutions, relying solely or mainly on offsite analysis.", "The Central Bank must be a presence that is felt continuously.", "Good supervision is sceptical but proactive.", "Supervisors must question, even in good times, the industry's direction or actions.", "Supervisors must have the capacity to identify risks, and to act on them.", "The Central Bank is most valuable when it is least valued.", "Supervisors must be constantly vigilant Good supervision is comprehensive.", "about happenings on the edge of the regulatory perimeter.", "The Central Bank must not confine its interests to risks faced by its regulated entities and must go beyond to risks posed by other parts of the financial system.", "Supervisors must be in a constant learning mode to respond to new products, new markets, new services, and new risks.", "The Central Bank must adapt to changes at the regulatory perimeter, with an eye to new or unregulated areas.", "Supervisors must follow through conclusively on matters identified as these issues progress through the supervisory process to their final resolution.", "The Central Bank must take every identified issue, however, small, to its conclusion.", "Judgement, not rules, is the key here.", "Supervisors would do well to learn the secret to success of Julie Dickson, head of Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and who supervises the world's strongest banks.", "Ms. Dickson's secret to success is to focus on bearish forecasters like Nouriel Roubini, assume the worst, and avoid complacency.", "Meanwhile, the Bank has augmented its supervisory expertise with specialists.", "Some of the more important initiatives included the establishment of an in-house Actuarial Unit headed by an experienced Actuary.", "This Unit allows the Bank to closely monitor, analyse and set direct attention to the sufficiency of actuarial reserves held by life insurers, as well as being able to verify the adequacy of outstanding claim reserves for non life companies.", "Going forward, the Actuarial Unit will be providing needed leadership in the development of an appropriate stress testing regime of the insurance industry.", "This, in turn, will support the Bank's financial stability initiatives.", "The Bank has also increased its credit risk supervisory expertise.", "Over the past four years the Bank has been conducting thematic reviews of credit risk management in the banking industry.", "This is an important step since credit risk is one of the main risks commercial banks face and has generally been responsible for past failures internationally and even nationally.", "Going forward, the Bank will be recruiting specialists with expertise in market and operational risks.", "At the national institutional level, we have begun work on the development of a Crisis Management Plan to facilitate, if needed, a rapid response and coordinated action to financial crises.", "Work is also underway on the establishment of a National Financial comprising officials from the Central Bank and other domestic regulators Stability Council such as the SEC and FIU.", "At this high-level Forum, members will be able to share information and views, discuss issues where responsibilities overlap and, if the need arise, co-ordinate responses to potential threats to financial stability.", "In closing, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my respectful view that the Central Bank has performed quite well in carrying out its responsibility for financial stability.", "But we cannot ignore the public perception - which is usually as important as reality - that the Bank faltered in relation to the failure of CLICO, CLICO Investment Bank, and BAT.", "Apart from balance sheet scars, the CLICO crisis may have left psychological scars on the population of Trinidad and Tobago.", "For many, memories of this failure are still fresh, causing an overestimation of the probability of a repeat disaster - the fear of fear itself.", "For the first time in its 48-year history, the Central Bank, through the Commission of Enquiry into these failed financial institutions, will be subject to public scrutiny about its regulation of the financial system.", "At the Commission of Enquiry, the Bank will be transparent in accounting for its regulatory and supervisory actions in respect of these institutions.", "As I close Ladies and Gentlemen, I once again, give you the assurance that the Central Bank will continue to work tirelessly to minimize the occurrence of another financial crisis in Trinidad and Tobago.", "In this way, the Bank will remain ahead of the financial stability curve, regaining and rebuilding public trust and confidence."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
