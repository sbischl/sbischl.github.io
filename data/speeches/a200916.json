crisis (GFC) period, a view has emerged that the era of exportled growth is over, and India missed the opportunity by not prioritizing exports at the right time.", "Globally, the key impediments to exports post-GFC include: (a) generalized increase in protectionism by trading partners; (b) weak global demand conditions; (c) race to the bottom (to gain unfair competitive advantage, by using a policy mix of competitive depreciation, subsidies, tax and regulatory concessions); and (d) automation, reducing the cost advantages stemming from cheap labour.", "Notwithstanding these impediments, and also the significant decline in trade intensity of world GDP growth in the post-GFC period, opportunities for expanding exports arise from the vastly altered global landscape for trade where more than two thirds of world trade occurs through global value chains (GVCs) .", "The higher the GVC participation of a country, the greater are the gains from trade as it allows participating countries to benefit from the comparative advantage of others participating in the GVC.", "Services such as transportation, banking, insurance, IT and legal services, branding, marketing and after sale services are integral to GVCs.", "India's participation in GVCs has been lower than many emerging and developing economies.", "India has global presence in low GVC products such as gems and jewellery, rice, meat and shrimps, apparels, cotton, and drugs and pharmaceuticals.", "Among the sunrise sectors that offer potential for higher exports in the post-COVID period are drugs and pharmaceuticals where India enjoys certain competitive advantages.", "With strong drug manufacturing expertise at low cost, India is one of the largest suppliers of generic drugs and vaccines.", "Some Indian manufacturers have already entered into new partnerships with global pharma companies to produce vaccines on a large scale for both domestic and global distribution.", "The Government has also approved an investment package for promotion of bulk drug parks and a production-linked incentive scheme is in place to enhance domestic production of drug intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients.", "A sharp policy focus on other GVC intensive \"network products\", including equipment for IT hardware, electrical appliances, electronics and telecommunications, and automobiles would also provide the cutting edge to India's export strategy with considerable scope for higher value additions.", "Domestic policies need to focus on the right mix of local and foreign content in exports while aiming to enhance participation in GVCs.", "Firms that engage in both imports and exports are found to be far more productive than non-trading firms (World Bank, 2020) .", "While choosing trade partners through free trade agreements (FTAs), it is also important to learn from global experience and nurture those trade agreements that go beyond traditional market access issues.", "Provisions relating to investment, competition, and intellectual property rights protection have a larger positive impact on GVC trade and need to be assiduously cultivated and ingrained into India's export ecosystem.", "(iv) Tourism as an Engine of Growth 23.", "Tourism has been one of the sectors in the economy most severely impacted by COVID19.", "At the same time, this is also a sector where pent up demand could drive a V shaped recovery when the situation normalises.", "India has immense potential to meet a diverse range of tourist interests - religion; adventure; medical treatment; wellness and yoga; sports; film making; and eco-tourism.", "We have four major biodiversity hotspots, 38 UNESCO World heritage sites, 18 biosphere reserves, over 7,000 km of coastline, rain forests, deserts, tribal habitation and a multi-cultural population.", "The challenge nevertheless is to scale up our tourism market and enhance its contribution to economic development.", "As per the Third Report of Tourism Satellite Account for India (TSAI) 2018, the share of tourism in GDP was 5.1 per cent in 2016-17 and the share in employment was 12.2 per cent (with the direct and indirect shares at 5.32 per cent and 6.88 per cent, respectively).", "In 2018- 19, tourism's share in employment increased further to 12.8 per cent, with the total size of employment at 87.5 million.", "The employment elasticity in this sector, thus, appears to be high.", "India attracted 10.89 million foreign tourists in 2019, an increase of 3.2 per cent over the previous year.", "The foreign exchange earnings generated by the sector during the same period was about \u20b92 trillion, a year-on-year increase of more than 8 per cent.", "The country also jumped six positions to 34 out of 140 counties in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index 2019 of the World Economic Forum (WEF).", "Recognising the potential of the sector, the Government has provided targeted policy support.", "The Ministry of Tourism has two major schemes: Swadesh Darshan for Integrated Development of Theme-Based Tourist Circuits; and PRASHAD as a Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive for development of tourism infrastructure in the country, including historical places and heritage cities.", "The multi-pronged supportive policy interventions in the sector may have to be reviewed and revamped, if tourism has to contribute more to the economy matching its potential.", "A closer look at some of the global leaders in travel and tourism such as France and Spain would suggest that these countries not only have excellent natural and cultural resources, but policies to support an exceptionally attractive tourist infrastructure, including a high hotel density offering all range of choices, quality public transport systems, networked air connectivity with considerable route capacity, and most importantly, safety and security.", "Initiatives need to be taken in the direction of improving and integrating various modes of transportation (linking air/train/metro/road/sea) with the provision for single point of booking, eregistration of service providers (travel agents, transport operators, hotels, tourist guides, etc.).", "Strict provisions of penalty for non-compliance would boost confidence of tourists, alongside an effective and speedy grievance redressal system for both domestic and foreign tourists.", "Research conducted by a private agency suggested that if we can increase international tourist arrivals to 20 million (i.e., about double of current arrivals), the incremental income would be US$19.9 billion, benefiting an additional 1 million people in the travel and tourism industry.", "(v) Food Processing for Surplus Management 29.", "COVID has brought the importance of food security and food distribution or supply chain network to the forefront of public policy debate in India.", "Successive years of record production of foodgrains and horticulture crops has transformed India into a food surplus economy.", "Recognising this challenge, much of the policy attention in recent years for the sector has focused on addressing post-production frictions, comprising agri-logistics, storage facilities, processing and marketing.", "Greater focus on processed food is one option that could help in dealing with multi-pronged challenges of surplus management.", "Development of the food processing industry is likely to benefit the farm sector and the economy through greater value addition to farm output, reducing food wastages, stabilising food prices, expanding export opportunities, encouraging crop diversification, providing direct and indirect employment opportunities, increasing farmers' income and enhancing consumer choices.", "Food processing is a sunrise industry.", "Globally, its importance in the consumer basket has increased over time, led by rising per capita incomes, urbanisation, and change in consumer perceptions regarding quality and safety.", "Despite having huge growth potential, the food processing industry in India is currently at a nascent stage, accounting for less than 10 per cent of total food produced in the country.", "As a result, despite being one of the largest producers of several agricultural commodities in the world, India ranks fairly low in the global food processing value chain.", "There is a need to move up the value chain.", "Moreover, the food processing industry in India is largely domestically oriented, with exports accounting for only 12 per cent of total output.", "India can move up in the global agricultural value chain by increasing its share of processed food exports, for which quality standards will be a critical factor.", "Food processing also offers huge employment potential.", "In India, while the food processing industry's contribution to overall Gross Value Added (GVA) is only 1.6 per cent, it accounts for 1.8 million (12.4 per cent) and 5.1 million (14.2 per cent) jobs in registered and un-incorporated sectors, respectively.", "Recognising this, the government has set the target for raising the share of processed food to 25 per cent of the total agricultural produce by 2025.", "The food processing sector was also opened up for 100 per cent FDI in 2016 under the automatic route.", "Further, in 2017, 100 per cent FDI under the government route for retail trading, including through ecommerce, was permitted in respect of food products manufactured and/or produced in India.", "For ensuring adequate credit flows, the Reserve Bank has accorded priority sector status to the food processing industry in 2015.", "In my address today, I have highlighted five critical areas that can determine the shape of our post-COVID trend growth.", "While dealing with the immediate crisis management challenges, we need to strategically prepare for our combined overriding goal - the pursuit of strong and sustainable growth.", "The private business sector has a critical role in each of the five areas I covered today.", "The enabling policy environment would evolve around the initiatives taken by India's businesses to seize these opportunities and actualise the potential of the Indian economy as a rising economic power of the 21st century.", "COVID-19 has changed our lives and it is increasingly clear that life will never be the same again.", "We should look upon these fundamental changes as opportunities rather than threats, converting them into game changing new vistas of progress.", "I do believe that together as a nation, we can certainly do it.", "Let me conclude on this optimistic note.", "ourworldindata.org World Bank, 2020 \"Global Productivity: Trends, Drivers and Policies\" (Chapter 3: What Happens to Productivity
