leather jacket.", "In retrospect, the 1987 crash was just a hiccup in what ultimately turned out to be a remarkable upturn in the city's performance and prospects.", "However, to really understand

opportunity in finance.", "At the time, the city's circumstances were improving but crime was still high, and there were still lots of problems caused by years of underinvestment.", "For example, I

well-established.", "There are even several grocery stores!", "The city weathered the recent financial crisis and the Great Recession far better than many would have anticipated.", "Although

industry.", "And New York City had 56 million visitors last year, nearly double the total of 25 years earlier.", "In 2011, an important milestone was reached: payroll employment surpassed its previous alltime peak, from 1969, and it has grown strongly since then.", "Crime rates have fallen significantly across the city since 1990, and real estate values have surged.", "One consistent source of strength for the city has been immigration.", "Over this period, New York City benefited from a sizable influx of immigrants, which more than offset out-migration in many neighborhoods.", "To illustrate this, let's take a look at one such neighborhood in Brooklyn, Sunset Park, that was losing residents to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s.", "As property values fell, new migrants from

revitalized whole neighborhoods: Russian and Ukrainian immigrants in Brighton Beach; Chinese and Korean immigrants in Flushing; and Indian immigrants in Jackson Heights, just to name a few.", "So, has it been all good news for New York City in recent years?", "One by-product of a strong economy and real estate market has been a decline in housing affordability, and an increase in homelessness.", "It is estimated that there are over 60,000 homeless people in New York City today-almost double the number from 10 years ago and more than four times as high as in the early 1980s.", "Moreover, poverty rates remain high in many parts of the city, and the education system can certainly be improved.", "Yet, a strong economy and a sound fiscal position at least provide the means to devote resources to help address these ongoing problems.", "This turnaround of New York City illustrates that reviving a city in trouble is indeed possible.", "There are some useful lessons from New York City's experience.", "First, it is often darkest before the dawn.", "Cities in fiscal distress are like individuals suffering from addiction: they often have to hit bottom and reach out to others for help before they can begin to recover.", "New York City hit bottom in 1975, and that created the impetus for reform.", "Second, in such situations, cities often have to give up fiscal control for a time.", "Accepting a Control Board and operating under its mandates was a painful, but necessary, step toward rebuilding the city's fiscal health and regaining access to financial markets.", "Third, when sound reforms are implemented it still takes a long time to achieve fruitful results, so it is important to stay the course.", "Fourth, although a strong economy, good fiscal position and

United States have of moving up in the world.", "New York City ranked 10th out of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas.", "The Big Apple should strive to be number one in this ranking by continuing to improve access to quality and affordable education and to job training.", "We should all do our part to help make this happen.", "Also, it is important to remember that the measure of a city's well-being is much broader than how many are employed and the level of economic activity.", "As Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, explained: In my own philanthropy and business endeavors, I have seen the critical role that the arts play in stimulating creativity and in developing vital communities...the arts have a crucial impact on our economy and are an important catalyst for learning, discovery, and achievement in our country.", "Through the fiscal crisis, into the 1980s and to the present day, the city maintained its status as a center of culture and the arts.", "The efforts of the city and the state, starting in the mid-1980s, to redevelop the Theatre District and Times Square area played an important role in revitalizing tourism.", "But, of course, the city's well-deserved reputation for culture and arts goes well beyond Broadway-to the hundreds of Off-Broadway and neighborhood theaters, museums, music venues and organizations like yours.", "Supporting this cultural infrastructure is important to maintaining a vibrant economy and a bright future.", "The experience of New York City, which has gone from crisis to vibrancy, shows that the past need not be prologue for the future.", "It also shows that a well-managed regime of fiscal control can help begin the process for future recovery.", "Other cities and regions are at different points in this journey.", "Puerto Rico, for example, which has been in recession for many years and which defaulted on its debt obligations earlier this year, is at a particularly critical juncture.", "On the positive side, the fact that Congress has enacted legislation, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, does provide a way forward.", "The prospect for good fiscal stewardship has improved and this is an essential first step in the Island's recovery.", "As I have noted elsewhere, there are significant opportunities for action that can leverage the Island's strengths to foster economic growth.", "These include its bilingual adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, wide experience as host to international corporations and close economic ties to the U.S. mainland.", "However, much as New York City took time to recover, so too will it take time for Puerto Rico to recover from its crisis of the last decade.", "The future of Puerto Rico is yet to be determined.", "However, the experience of New York City suggests that a turnaround is possible even when underlying conditions appear dire.", "New York City is a compelling example of what is possible when you leverage your citizens' ingenuity and capacity for reinvention.", "It shows what can be achieved with the appropriate discipline and effort.", "Thank you for your kind attention.", "Jason Bram, Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Luis Uranga assisted in preparing these remarks.", "Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline and Emmanuel Saez.", "\"Where is the
