work.", "At the international level generally, the succession of economic crises in recent years has prompted the authorities to review comprehensively the whole international financial architecture.", "Central to this response have been efforts to improve the quality and availability of economic and financial data and strengthen financial regulation.", "This is underpinned by institutional developments, such as the creation of two new bodies - the Financial Stability Forum and the G20.", "This is not today's subject.", "I mention it, however, because there will be changes ahead which will enforce new standards of regulation and transparency worldwide.", "It is against this background that we should assess the progress of the euro.", "The new currency is now in its second year.", "It is an accepted element of the international financial system, being the second largest currency - second only to the US dollar and ahead of the yen.", "The euro area has an internal

euro area economy.", "It follows that Irish experience will not greatly influence nor dictate policy.", "Our experience up to now has been decidedly different from that of the euro area generally, because of the scale of economic growth here in recent years.", "As a consequence, we have had to adjust to a monetary policy which, in the short term, is not well suited to Irish conditions.", "There

months, they remain substantially below what the Central Bank would consider as appropriate here in the present buoyant conditions.", "There is no longer an Irish exchange rate.", "We cannot impose formal ceilings or restrictions on the growth in credit, which is running at a very uncomfortable rate.", "We do require the lending institutions, however, to observe good prudential standards.", "As

on members to reflect a national viewpoint.", "This would be contrary to the spirit and the letter of economic and monetary union.", "On the previous occasion that I came before this Committee, I

467 million euro to the capital and foreign reserves of the European Central Bank.", "In practice, we retain and manage these funds here.", "They do not belong to us; they belong to the ECB.", "In

from the conduct of the money market.", "In short, the total assets of the Bank amount to 12.75 billion euro.", "For the greater part, these are matched by liabilities in the form of currency, bank deposits and Government deposits.", "The excess of assets over liabilities is represented by capital and internal reserves.", "This is the figure to which the term \"free reserves\" is applied.", "This is the capital which supports the Bank.", "It is also a buffer against changes in the value of external reserves, arising from movements in the euro vis-a\u0300-vis other currencies.", "Relative to the size of our balance sheet, this figure is at the lower end of the scale vis-a\u0300-vis other euro area national central banks.", "The national central banks in the Eurosystem no longer conduct foreign exchange intervention.", "It is fair to ask, therefore, whether they now have surplus external assets.", "There is a recognition that this question should be addressed in due course.", "These reserves are subject to call by the European Central Bank.", "In all likelihood it will make a further call for additional capital and foreign reserves.", "It would seem preferable therefore that the issue of superfluous reserves be settled at the general European level rather than taking unilateral action.", "Our external reserves are denominated, for the greater part in US dollars and to a much lesser extent in sterling and yen.", "There is also a small quantity of gold.", "The reserves are invested in deposits and securities and are managed by reference to an independent benchmark.", "The Central Bank has a very good record in managing large-scale funds.", "In respect of 1998 we earned a surplus of 225 million euro (IR\u00a3177 million), mainly from investment of reserves and

is still considered a currency in transition.", "In less than two years from now the new banknotes and coin will have begun to replace national currencies.", "The impact will be huge at local level; immediately the euro will become the concern of everybody.", "May I remind you that the largest banknote will be 500 euro (roughly \u00a3400) and the smallest coin will be one cent (which is 4/5 of a penny).", "There will be seven banknotes and eight coins.", "Our production arrangements are already well in hand.", "In recent years we have invested more than \u00a330 million in new plant and machinery.", "Coin production is under way since last autumn; we plan to begin the production of euro banknotes in April.", "We must provide, for our own initial needs, almost 200 million euro notes and over 900 million coins.", "We also must maintain an adequate supply of Irish notes and coin up to the end of next year.", "Despite the competition from electronic money, the demand for notes and coin continues to well exceed the growth in the economy.", "There have been some reports in recent months about a shortage of coin.", "There are 2,400 million coins in circulation.", "Last year we issued 236 million, which represents 60 additional coins for every person in the country.", "Overall, the entry into EMU has had a profound impact on organisation and work practices in the Central Bank of Ireland.", "The euro is now the currency of the State.", "The Irish pound is now a denomination of the euro and it is no longer traded on the foreign exchange market.", "There is constant daily interaction with the European Central Bank.", "Our personnel serve on a wide range of European Central Bank committees.", "The Eurosystem is quite unique; while policy is determined collectively in Frankfurt, it is implemented on a decentralised basis by the national central banks.", "It is important that this emphasis on decentralisation is not eroded over time.", "The Irish economy I have said earlier that within the euro area Ireland continues to be the grand exception because of our rate of economic growth.", "Studies undertaken by the Central Bank suggest that, for the medium term, we have the capacity to sustain a growth rate of the order of 4-5%.", "This is about twice the estimated potential growth rate for most European economies.", "The exceptional growth over and above this for the past few years was made possible by a high degree of slack in the economy and in particular, by a rather low employment rate.", "This good performance contributed to a welcome increase in living standards and employment.", "Now, however, there is mounting evidence of overheating in the domestic economy.", "This is reflected in exceptionally rapid increases in property prices, unprecedented demand for credit, labour shortages, higher inflation in the services sector and chronic congestion in the physical infrastructure.", "During the past year, there has been a marked disimprovement in our inflation performance, both in absolute terms and by reference to our main trading partners.", "In January, the rate of inflation here, as measured by the HICP, the benchmark index for euro area comparisons, was 4.4%.", "This was two and a half times the rate prevailing in the euro area as a whole.", "This puts us at the top of the league table.", "Some of the rise in headline inflation can be ascribed to once-off or temporary factors - such as the rise in excise duty on cigarettes, higher oil prices and weakness in the euro.", "There is, however, a strong rise in underlying inflation which for the most part reflects the existence of strong demand.", "Nobody claims that inflation here must be at precisely the same level as in the euro area generally.", "It is reasonable to expect some differential at this time in view of our economic conditions but there are obvious limits.", "The point I want to emphasise is that, if present trends persist, we may have a sharp loss of competitiveness on our hands.", "One of the inevitable consequences of an integrated European economy and a single currency is the strong tendency to centralise financial activities in the larger centres and an increase in cross-border competition.", "This is a threat to the Irish financial services industry, which has been expanding vigorously in recent years.", "It is compounded by the pressures within the industry for mergers and acquisitions, which are driven by new technology and the perceived benefits of economics of scale.", "I would like to believe that in ten years from now we will continue to have a vibrant indigenous financial services industry.", "I would be optimistic that the International Financial Services Centre will continue to grow and evolve as an integral part of our financial system.", "After years of preparation, EMU is now a reality.", "In time, we will undoubtedly benefit from being part of an economy whose currency has a leading international status.", "We will benefit also from internal price stability and the security that this brings.", "We must not lose sight of the reality, however, that membership of the euro area also imposes new disciplines, which will be put to the test at some stage.", "There is no provision in the Eurosystem for a bail-out in the event that any member encounters serious economic difficulties.", "We can no longer fall back on the exchange rate or interest rates.", "We can no longer control credit.", "Having said this, the advantages of being part of the euro area should well outweigh the disadvantages in the long term.", "I am confident that we will come to realise this more and more as time goes on."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
