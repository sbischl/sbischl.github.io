I will come back to it (2) disclose: impose transparency requirements including on counterparties; (3) incorporate climate risk, into our operations on corporates (on both asset purchases and collateral policies).", "As regards asset purchases, the CSPP should take into account climate-related factors, including the alignment of issuers with the Paris agreement, and will adjust purchases on the primary and secondary markets accordingly.", "Moreover, regarding euro-denominated non-monetary portfolios, Eurosystem central banks committed last February to implement sustainable and responsible investment strategies and to report the first results by end of 2022.", "Banque de France's policy has been exemplary since 2018 regarding the management of its own funds, whose alignment on a 2\u00b0 C objective is already effective.", "We won't stop there though: we started to exit from non-conventional oil and gas earlier this year, we announced that we are exiting totally from coal by end 2024.", "We now commit to work toward aligning our own portfolios with a 1.5\u00b0C objective.", "One additional word about the international context of these developments.", "Here again, we saw a major improvement this last year with the new American involvement: climate-related issues are now firmly on the agenda of the G20, the G7, the FSB and all other standard setting bodies.", "The NGFS, created in Paris in December 2017, is a unique knowledge hub.", "It now has 95 members, including the US Fed since last December and this number will still grow in coming weeks.", "The Banque de France provides its global secretariat with 15 staff, and we created last April our Climate Change Centre chaired by Nathalie Aufauvre.", "We are indeed making good progress across the board.", "But each year that passes without sufficient emission reductions makes the issue more severe, and the solutions more radical.", "To grapple with this dynamic situation, it is imperative that we are able to better understand and forecast the macroeconomic impacts of climate developments.", "An imperative for the year to come: forge models that gauge the interaction between climate and the economy One aspect of the ECB's action plan launched on the back of the strategy review may have received too little attention: macroeconomic modelling and scenario analyses.", "The challenge is huge as we face a triple source of uncertainty: first, how climate change will materialise, second, what the transition could look like and, third, how both will translate to the macroeconomy.", "The NGFS has produced detailed macro financial scenarios and the corresponding data that provide the most comprehensive framework to date for financial risk assessment.", "To make such scenarios possible, the central banking community -
