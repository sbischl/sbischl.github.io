to be added to our agenda for further study.", "On some topics we will be reporting on recent developments, while on others we will be sharing thoughts and ideas that are yet in the process of development.", "Among the major challenges of today's world is the challenge of change, and an occasion like this one provides a forum for us to share perspectives on where changes to the financial

individuals that, for all their rainy day savings, they consider Government savings bonds instead.", "Savings bonds are just as convenient as savings deposits, because you buy them at commercial banks, and they are just as liquid as savings deposits, because you can cash them in at any time.", "However, if you hold them for the full five years of their maturity you earn an interest rate in the region of 5 percent, compounded over 5 years.", "One area which our financial sector does not serve very well is the financing of innovation and of small and medium enterprises.", "This is an area
