pu\u0304tea.", "As part of that, I look forward to discussing our recent Monetary Policy Statement and Capital Review in the ample time we have for Q&A.", "Ahead of that, I would like to make a few opening remarks on a topic connected to Ma\u0304ori investment capability.", "That is, how the Reserve Bank is building its own capability in the Ma\u0304ori world - Te Ao Ma\u0304ori (Figure 1).", "Our Te Ao Ma\u0304ori approach Source: Reserve Bank of New Zealand I will outline its three elements: \u2022 cultural capability, \u2022 engagement.", "The obvious opening question is: why does the Reserve Bank need to develop its understanding of Te Ao Ma\u0304ori?", "The very simple answer is that we are New Zealand's central bank and Ma\u0304ori values are part of our national identity - how we see ourselves, and how we are viewed by the world.", "It is something that should mark the Reserve Bank of New Zealand apart as the central bank for Aotearoa.", "For me it took returning to New Zealand after living overseas for nine years to fully grasp this.", "While every New Zealander will have their own unique history and whakapapa, as a whole, Ma\u0304ori culture, and the relationship

Te Reo Ma\u0304ori (the Ma\u0304ori language) and Ma\u0304ori tikanga (customary practices or behaviours) into our organisational culture.", "While I am proud to have reached the modest (and slightly ambiguous) Ievel of 'Advanced Beginner' in my Te Reo, the most rewarding part of this has been seeing the enthusiasm of my colleagues.", "In particular, the passion of first and second generation New Zealanders to learn Te Reo.", "It has reinforced to me that many new New Zealanders see learning Ma\u0304ori culture as a key part of Aotearoa being their home and their identity too.", "Another key part of embedding Ma\u0304ori culture is developing the art of our storytelling.", "In that regard, with the approval of Northern hapu Te Roroa3, we have borrowed the legend of Ta\u0304ne Mahuta to connect with our stakeholders and tell the story of the Reserve Bank4 (Figure 2).", "The journey of Te Pu\u0304tea Matua: our Ta\u0304ne Mahuta Northern hapu Te Roroa is the kaitiaki to Ta\u0304ne

economic independence, the Reserve Bank was established in 1934 to issue New Zealand's official currency and return mana to Aotearoa.", "In the same way that Ta\u0304ne Mahuta is part of the forest

Ta\u0304ne will not wilt and lose mana.", "To remind us and our visitors of this metaphor and connection, you will soon start to see subtle physical changes in both our Wellington and Auckland offices.", "Policymaking (Kaitiakitanga) The second part of building our Te Ao Ma\u0304ori capability is through our policymaking.", "At the very simplest level, this is about explaining and describing how our mandate aligns with Ma\u0304ori values - in particular, acting as a guardian by taking a sustainable, long-term view of wealth and wellbeing.", "Let me offer a few examples at the heart of what we do.", "Monetary policy The name of the Reserve Bank in Ma\u0304ori is Te Pu\u0304tea Matua.", "This literally means the parent or guardian of all the money.", "Over the past 30 years,

view to ensuring that long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored around our target.", "By creating an environment of low and stable inflation, we aim to give New Zealanders the confidence to

capital to reduce the probability of a banking crisis to an event that may only happen once every 200 years.", "At its heart, this reflects an assessment of the deep harm that financial crises cause not only to the economy, but to the fabric of society and wellbeing of our citizens for a prolonged period.", "In this sense, our determination to safeguard the resilience of the financial system over the long term is comparable to the obligation to protect taonga for future generations.", "Sustainable finance In recent years, central banks around the world have focused more on climate change and its impact on the financial system.", "We are part of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which comprises a group of 50 central banks and regulators8 (Figure 5).", "See the NGFS website: .", "The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial Source: NGFS website Our involvement has acted as a catalyst to use our role as a kaitiaki and financial regulator to challenge banks and insurance companies about how they are managing risks from climate change.", "For example, does it make financial sense to lend to a company or industry that is following unsustainable environmental practices?", "Will that company or industry exist in the long-term to repay its loans, or will it fail and disappear due to new environmental regulations or pressures from broader society?", "What role can banks and insurers play to influence the companies they interact with, to help ensure they have sustainable long-term futures?", "In my mind, this shift in approach has strong parallels with the funds management industry.", "When I first started in funds management 10 years ago, investing according to Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors was a niche approach.", "The perception was ESG investing was a style for those investors who wanted to 'do the right thing' for moral reasons, and were willing to accept a lower return by reducing their set of investment opportunities.", "Roll the clock forward 10 years, and this view has been completely flipped on its head.", "ESG investing has grown rapidly and become a completely mainstream approach, with investors now asking, \"Why would you invest in a company that is less likely to survive in the long-term due to its unsustainable environmental, social or governance practices\"?", "Earlier this year, Larry Fink, the CEO of the world's largest fund manager, Blackrock, said in his influential annual letter to clients that climate change has bought us to \"the edge of a RBNZ climate change strategy - -stability/climate-change/strategy.", "fundamental reshaping of finance\" and that Blackrock is committed to \"place sustainability at the centre of (its) investment approach\".", "In many ways, these insights have long been laid out in the Ma\u0304ori world view, with its focus on the environment, sustainability and intergenerational thinking.", "You could argue that it has been a case of the modern investment world that we know today catching up with a Ma\u0304ori world view, rather than the other way around.", "At the Reserve Bank, we are aware that to be a good kaitiaki we must lead by example.", "In regards to our focus on climate change, we have pledged to: \u2022 monitor our own carbon footprint - our currency operations are by far the biggest \u2022 incorporate the impact of climate change on our core functions; and, \u2022 lead other institutions through collaboration.", "Notably, last year we invested US$100 million of our own balance sheet into bonds via the Bank for International Settlement USD Green Bond Investment Pool.", "By joining other central banks around the world, we hope to help shape the landscape for green investment standards as they develop.", "In addition to working with central banks in the global arena, at home we have partnered with private and public agencies to tackle issues that reach across the financial system.", "Last year, we participated in the Sustainable Finance Forum (SFF) hosted by the Aotearoa Circle.", "The recently released interim report12 draws upon the Ma\u0304ori world view of Kaitiakitanga, and proposes the principles and practice to reverse the decline of our natural resources.", "In particular, we endorse the Report's recommendation to make climate change-related disclosure mandatory.", "Currently, 60 percent of surveyed banks (and a third of surveyed insurers) already disclose some information on climate risk.", "To improve data availability and consistency to investors - and to avoid companies 'cherry-picking' their ESG disclosures - we support further efforts towards a credible and workable climate reporting framework.", "There is still a lot more work to be done.", "We will be responding to the SFF's call for leadership from government agencies in their own areas of expertise.", "For our part, the Reserve Bank will lead the Council of Financial Regulators (CoFR)

disproportionally on the primary industries in which Ma\u0304ori businesses are concentrated.", "We hear from you that collectively-owned assets pose challenges to accessing bank credit.", "While this may be seen as a disadvantage in the short term, in the long term, lower leverage can bring greater resilience to economic shocks and longer-term sustainability.", "This means, in the longer term, Ma\u0304ori businesses with collectively-owned assets may have a stabilising effect on the economy as a whole.", "This could be an advantage that attracts investment partners.", "What we see as pivotal is the continued growth of forums where Ma\u0304ori businesses can interact, exchange ideas, and lead the rest of the country.", "With respect to this, we pay tribute to the Federation of Ma\u0304ori Authorities, Iwi Chairs Forum17, Pou Taiao and others for their efforts in levelling information asymmetries across far-reaching and diverse networks for all Ma\u0304ori to thrive.", "Engaging with data In addition to getting out to meet and talk with Ma\u0304ori businesses, we are also putting greater effort into analysing disaggregated economic data to build our understanding of the Ma\u0304ori economy.", "One striking statistic is the demographics of the Ma\u0304ori population (Figure 7).", "It highlights that Ma\u0304ori are likely to make up a growing proportion of our future population and labour force, and continuing influence on our culture.", "Particularly fishing, forestry, and farming.", "For example, the Poutama Trust, Te Puni Kokiri, and other regional

around twice as high as the national average (Figure 8).", "Unemployment rate Source: Statistics New Zealand On this, it is encouraging to see that Ma\u0304ori businesses continue to address

and investors.", "In the past, Business and Economics Research (BERL) have undertaken the most comprehensive studies of the Ma\u0304ori economy.", "At the Reserve Bank, we need to do more to deepen our understanding of Ma\u0304ori economic statistics in order to achieve our dual mandate.", "Last year, our mandate was revised to incorporate the objectives of both price stability and contributing to maximum sustainable employment.", "This provides a direct motivation to better understand the Ma\u0304ori labour market.", "Te Ao Ma\u0304ori and policy decisions.", "Some might ask: So, will a focus on Te Ao Ma\u0304ori mean that the Reserve Bank will set the OCR or bank capital requirements differently?", "My guess is that it is it unlikely to be that stark.", "Our shift in focus will not be the one thing that prompts us to put up the OCR instead of putting it down; or lower capital requirements instead of raising them.", "However, we have no doubt that a richer understanding of Te Ao Ma\u0304ori will contribute to better policy making in the long run.", "Building strong relationships and understanding right across the economy and society helps give us the best chance of making good policy decisions, and enables us to communicate our approach back to our wide range of partners and stakeholders to build confidence and trust.", "I think the best recent example of this is our recent work on the Future of Cash (Te Moni Anamata).", "This involved an extensive consultation right across the country on the role of cash in our society, and prompted a huge reaction of over 2,000
