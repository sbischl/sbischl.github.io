such as, medical care, education, recreation and amusement, transport and communication and personal care and effects - in CPI-IW showed a significant inflation of over 8 per cent.", "It may, however, be indicated that CPIs recorded very similar trends as the food component of WPI despite the divergence of the overall indices during the recent period (Chart 3).", "Co-movement of Inflation Rates based on WPI (Food) and CPIs 13.", "Following the recommendation of the Working Group for Revision of Wholesale Price Index (Chairman: Prof. Abhijit Sen), the base year is being updated to 2004-05.", "The proposed basket of manufactured products in the new series would cover significantly a higher number of commodities and would integrate items from both organised and un-organised manufacturing sectors.", "While this would improve coverage, the challenge is to ensure collection of price data on a regular basis so that the quality could be maintained.", "The revised WPI basket, however, would not include services prices.", "An Expert Group (Chairman: Prof. C.

Chandrasekhar) is looking into process of developing a service price index.", "In order to enhance the representativeness of WPI index, it is important to expand the coverage to include services.", "Producer Price Index 14.", "Even when we have a revised WPI, we would still not have a Producer Price Index (PPI).", "The PPI covers price changes faced by the producers on primary, intermediate and finished goods and services ready for the market.", "The primary difference between the WPI and the PPI is, in addition to the coverage, that the WPI reflects changes in the average cost of production including mark-ups and taxes, while the PPI measures price changes of transacted goods at the gate excluding taxes.", "The purpose of the PPI is to provide a measure of prices received by producers of commodities.", "The PPI usually covers the industrial (manufacturing) sector as well as public utilities (electricity, gas and communications).", "Some countries also include agriculture, mining, transportation, and business services.", "Most of the countries replaced WPIs with PPIs in the 1970s and 1980s.", "For analytical purposes, it would be desirable to initiate the process of compilation of PPI for India.", "New Consumer Price Indices 15.", "At the retail level, CPI is meant to reflect the cost of living conditions and is computed on the basis of the changes in the level of retail prices of selected goods and services on which consumers spend the major part of their income.", "Therefore, a broad based CPI for the country as a whole, including both services and manufacturing products, has greater relevance for monetary policy formulation.", "In India, however, data on CPI relates to different segments of the population rather than the entire population.", "With a view to addressing this issue, the Reserve Bank had taken the initiative and prepared an approach paper on CPI (Urban) and CPI (Rural).", "Subsequently, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) has taken up the work for generating data on CPI (Urban) and CPI (Rural).", "The new CPIs once complied will go a long way in filling a major data gap in price statistics.", "Secondary (derived) measures of inflation 17.", "A representative measure of inflation for the country as a whole and availability of information on inflation at high frequency with limited time lag are important for the conduct of monetary policy.", "A number of empirical works based on the long-run equilibrium analysis have found that money supply and WPI series are cointegrated to a fair extent, thus providing evidence on the WPI being more amenable to monetary policy changes (Reddy, 1999).", "The Report of the Working Group on Money Supply (1998) also used WPI as inflation measure and found that the nominal money demand equation showed long-run price elasticity close to unity.", "Even though conventionally WPI inflation has been used as the headline inflation, several limitations have emerged in the recent past that complicate a realistic assessment of inflation based essentially on WPI.", "This underscores the need for a representative measure of inflation for better articulation of monetary policy with the objective to anchor inflationary expectations.", "Since inflation objective has to be pursued by the Reserve Bank, to avoid any conflict of interest, the primary statistics on inflation should be generated by another statistical agency.", "Deseasonalised trend inflation 18.", "Apart from the headline inflation, for policy purposes, central banks look at various secondary (derived) measures of inflation to gauge the underlying inflationary pressures.", "One such indicator of inflationary momentum is annualized month-over-month seasonally adjusted inflation.", "However, the use of such indicator for emerging market economies like India has its limitations because it could be quite volatile (Chart 4).", "Annualised M-o-M WPI (seasonally adjusted) Inflation 19.", "Another way to analyse inflation data is by looking at \"core inflation,\" which is generally a chosen measure of inflation that excludes the more volatile categories like food and energy prices.", "The main argument here is that the central bank should effectively be responding to the movements in permanent component of the price level rather than temporary deviations.", "There are many variants of core inflation which try to remove the volatility of price changes by statistical means.", "These include truncation of commodities based on standard deviation of price changes, trimmed mean, median and other filter based smoothing techniques.", "Various measures of WPI-based core inflation for the years 2008-09 and 2009-10 are presented in Table 2.", "It can be seen that the core measures show significant month to month variations, though the volatility has been lower compared to the headline measure.", "Since core inflation is derived from the headline, it reflects the weaknesses in the primary measure of inflation.", "A prerequisite of a good inflation measure is that it is broader in coverage and the base period is updated frequently reflecting structural changes in the economy.", "In Indian context, the derivation of core inflation by exclusion of food and energy from CPI/WPI discards a substantial portion of the commodity basket.", "So the price movement of the remaining commodities may not be representative of the underlying inflationary trend.", "Although these prices have substantial effects on the overall index, they often are quickly reversed.", "But the reversal of volatile prices sometimes is not short-lived.", "Therefore, determining when to use a core inflation measure versus an overall inflation measure remains a complex issue.", "Various WPI-based Core Inflation Measures4 1.5 SD method: This method excludes all those commodities in which percentage price change is more than mean plus/minus 1.5 standard deviation over mean price change.", "Trimmed mean: The trimmed mean procedure estimate price change of each commodities, arrange them in increasing order, calculate cumulative weight of the series and cut the commodities for which cumulative weight is less than 8 per cent or greater than 92 per cent.", "Median: This procedure computes price change for all the commodities, arrange them in ascending order, calculate cumulative weight of the new series and take the inflation of the first commodity for which cumulative weight is greater than or equal to 50 per cent.", "Reweighting: In this method, we compute price change, calculate standard deviation of price change for WPI-All Commodities as well as each commodities over a period of time, calculate historical standard deviation for each commodity as the difference between WPI-All Commodities standard deviation and standard deviation of that commodity.", "Then, we calculate final weight as the reciprocal of historical standard deviation, multiplied by initial weight.",

"The divergence between alternative inflation measures complicates the conduct of monetary policy in India.", "Accordingly, the Reserve Bank looks at all the measures of inflation, both overall and disaggregated components, in conjunction with other economic and financial indicators, to assess the underlying inflationary conditions.", "As indicated by Governor Dr. Subbarao, \"the Reserve Bank has been constantly engaged in the refinements of the various price indices and would continue to provide the necessary support to the Government to bring about further improvements in the measurement of inflationary conditions\".", "In the context of monetary policy formulation, it is important to have a robust primary measure of inflation at the national level.", "In this direction, the compilation of CPI (Urban) and CPI (Rural) could pave the way for a representative CPI for the country.", "There is also a need to augment the new series of WPI with a service price index to improve
