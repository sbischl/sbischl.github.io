thanks to the impeccable national credit rating - the banks in Ireland readily accommodated the demand for credit from (a) big developers and from (b) house-purchasers who bought the houses they were building, in many cases risking over-extension in order to get onto the bottom rung of a property ladder that seemed to be soaring out of reach; in other cases scrambling up that ladder, or branching out into the buy-to-let market, at home and abroad as a seemingly promising investment in the rising market.", "[Charts: Household debt-to-income ratios over the years, international comparison; (ii) bank net borrowing from abroad as % GNP 1999-2011] First to feel the cold draft of creditor withdrawals were the banks.", "Their borrowings from the international market had been mainly at short-term, and the market's growing reluctance after 2007 to roll over these funds in light of well-founded concerns about the banks' solvency led the Government to assume the liabilities.", "As has often been remarked, there is plenty to criticise in the way in which the September 2008 guarantee was put in place, including the extent of the guarantee, its cast-iron nature, and the lack of consultation with official partners who might have agreed to share the burden.", "But what cannot - in light of subsequent events - be doubted is that there would, in any case, have been irresistible pressure from those partners to ensure that losses would not fall on depositors or senior bondholders, given the fragility of banking worldwide in those frenetic weeks of September and October 2008, and indeed thereafter.", "Whatever about the merits of such an international policy, it has been in place ever since, greatly expanding the indebtedness of the Irish State.", "Although the burden it imposed was what tipped Ireland into losing the confidence of the bond markets, and triggering the need for the EU-IMF Programme, it would be unwise to focus too exclusively on the debt assumed by the State from the banks as a determining factor for Irish economic prospects and the current situation of the Irish economy.", "Indeed, much of the deterioration in the net fiscal position of the Government in 2009 is for reasons other than the jump in debt (though of course associated with the unwinding of the credit-driven property bubble).", "And equally or even more important as the public debt per se is the fall in the numbers at work and the surge in unemployment, and the consequence that has had on wellbeing, and on the affordability of debt assumed by households.", "numbers at work and unemployment rate 1960-2011] The jump in debt certainly began to hang over the economy.", "In the public accounts, debt reached the point where foreign investors lost confidence in the certainty of Irish Government debt, leading (against a background of wider concerns on public debt in the euro area) to the need for official financial assistance from the EU and IMF.", "For the private sector, the debt burdening many firms and families, who have got caught up in unaffordable levels of debt, hampers their ability -

debtors and non-debtors - have had to fall back on social protection payments.", "No doubt the necessary increase in taxation and lowering of wages and salaries in some jobs especially in the public sector has contributed debt distress, and indeed, the CSO's SILC survey showed a relatively large number of non-poor5 households cutting back on what would previously have been considered normal expenditures.", "For example, 17 per cent of those in non-poor households reported themselves to have been unable to afford an evening out in the previous fortnight, up from 6 per cent in the boom; 9 per cent went without heating for some time (up from 4 per cent); and over 18 per cent couldn't afford to replace worn-out furniture (up from 10 per cent).", "Not measured in these statistics are the stress and other health issues and their ramifications for the wellbeing of the overindebted.", "Against such a background, the policy challenge facing any Government is to ensure that arrangements for dealing with unaffordable debt are fair and technically efficient, and offer a viable pathway for over-indebted individuals and families to re-establish their solvency and resume their role as productive members of society.", "It should on the one hand avoid resulting in families losing their homes where this is not necessary, and on the other avoid creating a perverse incentive for those who can afford to pay their debts to exploit the system at the expense of the rest of society.", "The last caveat is especially relevant in the present situation where, although the banks have been provided with enough capital to allow for loan modifications in respect of loans that are clearly unaffordable, unnecessary debt forgiveness could quickly erode that buffer, placing a further burden on the Government finances, which they are in no condition to absorb.", "The approach sketched by the proposed legislation on personal debt, draft heads of which have been announced by the Government, is consistent with this approach.", "But banks should in most cases be able to arrive at arrangements with their debtors that do not require use of the new legislation.", "Admittedly it is a major and complex task for the banks to implement at sufficient scale a programme of effective engagement with troubled borrowers.", "The banks have all been progressively moving towards this, encouraged strongly by the Central Bank which has ramped up its monitoring of these efforts.", "Early engagement, fair procedures, tailored forbearance or rescheduling adapted to individual debtor circumstances and which respect the current and future ability to pay are watchwords in the development of a sufficient response.", "That has not yet been achieved by the banks.", "Until it is, there is the risk that far too many debtors will bypass what should be in most cases a more efficient way of working out their problems and proceed directly to the new insolvency procedures being set up according to the draft legislation that has been published.", "Ideally, only cases that prove impossible to resolve in bilateral negotiation, including some situations of complex indebtedness involving multiple creditors, would so proceed.", "For its part, the Central Bank is reviewing the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears to see if any elements need to be refined to avoid hampering the fair and effective bank engagement with borrowers which is essential to a successful outcome for all.", "(Many other initiatives are under way including the establishment of a comprehensive credit registry which, looking to the future, will help improve the precision of lenders' decisions, ensuring that credit is going to where it can be repaid and not otherwise.)", "The legislation streamlines bankruptcy and shortens both the period before discharge and the post-discharge period during which a payments order can be in force.", "At last there will be a clear option for those who truly cannot pay to escape from unreasonable creditors.", "Nevertheless, the fact that the family home would be forfeit would alone continue to make bankruptcy in Ireland very unattractive to debtors.", "Furthermore, a very strict interpretation of the \"reasonable expenses\" that the bankrupt is left with will no doubt continue to be applied to the bankrupt before discharge (even if the post-discharge payments order might be somewhat less onerous).", "The non-judicial Personal Insolvency Arrangement holds out the prospect of a better balance, though the devil is in the detail.", "With its combination of debt modification and a period of six years during which the debtor must pay a sum - potentially income-related - to the creditors, the proposed arrangement is flexible enough to allow a reasonable incentive for the debtor to get back on their feet as productive members of society, while not gifting a quick escape for those who have been offered a reasonable and affordable long-term mortgage arrangement.", "Much of the practical detail remains to be worked out, especially - how to define \"affordability\" of a payment arrangement, in the short and in the long run (in particular whether it leaves the debtor enough to live with dignity) and - assessing both (i) the degree to which subsequent increases in income - and in the value of the home - might be partly clawed back, while still offering the debtor the opportunity to make a fresh start and (ii) practical ways of doing so.", "Since we in Ireland have very limited experience of such arrangements, these issues deserve detailed public discussion and debate.", "(The PIA in particular is a home-grown innovation tailored to the reality that mortgage debt is the major problem; getting the various elements ideally balanced will not be easy.)", "The parameters that are arrived at would also, of course, inform the debt modification arrangements offered by banks bilaterally to overindebted debtors before they get to thinking about seeking access to the new formal procedures, thereby avoiding what could become a large administrative burden on the proposed Insolvency Service.", "In addition to the point I made earlier about distributional consequences, administrative challenges abound in this area, and there will have to be an evolving system of review, feedback and learning as a fair, efficient and effective system is constructed.", "Other countries faced with similar problems are also struggling here.", "The US HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program) programme was intended to incentivise lenders to provide realistic loan modifications thereby avoiding unnecessary foreclosures and repossessions.", "However this and other programmes have not succeeded in reaching their target coverage, and repossessions in the US have soared.", "In Ireland the number of repossessions has traditionally been low, and while it has increased in the past two years, in 2011 it still amounted to less than 1 per cent of the number of mortgages.", "For owner-occupied houses the traditional Irish reluctance to foreclose is certainly not misplaced.", "There is every reason to play long when it comes to managing a distressed owner-occupier mortgage: versions of the split mortgage concept mentioned by the Keane Committee, which reduce current servicing costs of the debt to manageable levels for households that have had suffered adverse income shocks but with the potential for some clawback if house value and household income recover, while a bit complex to implement, could be the key to a satisfactory solution for all, including the State.", "The buy-to-let sector is more complex, including as it does a wide range of different circumstances, sometimes including extended family arrangements.", "It would be unwise to generalise, but there are many circumstances in which there is less reason to be inhibited about repossessing buy-to-let properties.", "Where loan delinquency relates to pure investment type \"buy-to-lets\", it is surely now past time for the banks to be dealing more proactively with the situation of overindebted buy-to-let borrowers no longer able to service the debts they assumed in order to take investment positions - now loss-making - in property.", "It is in the long-term interest both of the banks (and therefore the State) and the borrowers that the banks continue to ramp-up their capacity to engage with and process such debtors in order to determine, on the basis of actual and prospective income, what repayment they can realistically be expected to service fully, repossessing the collateral where necessary.", "While this may involve the banks in having to manage a portfolio of repossessed buy-to-let properties, this is not an insurmountable task and should in any event facilitate the improved functioning of the property market and getting closer to a market-clearing price by bringing to the market (in an orderly and managed way) many of those properties which at present are implicitly hanging over it as an excess supply.", "Overall, systematic and effective engagement can bring predictability to hopelessly overindebted borrowers, restoring their ability and motivation to become productive members of society.", "With almost \u20ac100 billion of mortgage debt in the Republic outstanding in the banks guaranteed by the Government, the working-out of troubled mortgage debt is a matter of immense national importance.", "Achieving the right balance between realism in what can be collected and prudence in managing the limited but adequate capital resources that have been provided to the banks by the Government is vital.", "Failure in this regard would press on the already fragile finances of the State.", "The new personal insolvency arrangements could underpin a good outcome here, but the final form of their precise architecture and especially the operational parameters (how to define affordability etc.)", "Much also falls on the banks, whose role in ensuring a realistic and effective approach to loan recovery -
