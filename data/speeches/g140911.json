only at horizons as far as 2022 does expected inflation appear to be consistent with the ECB definition of price stability.", "With declining, even negative, inflation rates the consolidation of public and private debt is more difficult, while persisting nominal rigidities hamper the adjustment of relative prices.", "This difficult situation is aggravated by persistent divergences among countries.", "Fragmentation of financial markets along national lines in the euro area has progressively receded after the announcement of the OMT programme in the summer of 2012, but is still present.", "Firms' and households' borrowing costs in stressed countries are still higher than average, mainly reflecting the larger credit risk.", "For example, in July the cost of new bank loans for Italian non-financial corporations remained 60 basis points higher than the euro area average.", "The response of monetary policy has been wide-ranging.", "Last week the ECB's Governing Council decided to further cut policy rates to new unprecedented levels, basically reaching the zero lower bound for the Main Refinancing Operations;
