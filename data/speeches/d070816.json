independence, transparency, accountability and an explicit mandate to maintain price stability.", "The Eurosystem goes to great lengths to communicate the ECB's monetary policy strategy, the rationale for monetary policy decisions and our assessment of economic developments.", "These communication efforts not only take the form of regular testimonies in the European and national Parliaments,

take place immediately after Governing Council meetings and which provide \"question and answer sessions\" for journalists.", "The ECB's monetary policy is based on a clearly defined monetary policy

divergent developments in inflation and growth, as well as asymmetric effects of these shocks across countries posed challenges, especially for a new central bank.", "Given such an environment of constant economic uncertainties and challenges, the European Central Bank has put a monetary policy strategy in place that is based on a comprehensive analysis of economic and monetary developments.", "That means that the Governing Council cross-checks the information gained from economic analysis with all available evidence from a wide range of monetary, credit and asset market indicators.", "Looking back, this monetary strategy has served us very well, despite some inherent volatility between money demand and inflation: Since 2004, private lending and money aggregates have grown in parallel and at accelerated speed.", "This was an early indication of the current economic upswing, which most other data did not signal until much later.", "Indeed, the ECB's monetary policy strategy contributed to the timely and highly warranted adjustment of the ECB's monetary policy stance, with the first interest rate increase in December 2005, which was to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize.", "Having said this, we are aware that strong money and credit growth may also signal the build-up of financial imbalances and potential price bubbles in asset markets, as could be indicated, for instance, by significant housing price increases in some regions in the euro area.", "Despite the negative factors mentioned before inflation stood at only 2.2% in

rates in a slightly U-shaped way.", "The ECB staff projections from March 2007 foresee annual inflation averaging between 1.5% and 2.1% this year and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008.", "Given these

said this, upside risks to price stability remain and relate foremost to higher wage claims, and of course the oil price.", "Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures.", "Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted.", "Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not

the ECB - fiscal and structural policies remain the responsibility of national governments.", "It is important to understand that unsustainable fiscal policies may put the entire euro area at risk.", "For instance, higher risk premiums in response to unsustainable policies in one Member State could spill over to other euro area countries.", "Hence, membership in the euro area also means compliance with a stringent regulatory framework, the Stability and Growth Pact.", "We are aware that the present improvement of fiscal balances in the euro area, from -2.4% in 2005 to an expected -1.6% in

budgetary consolidation in order to prepare for challenges such as population ageing and to create room to maneuver for future economic weaknesses.", "Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound public finances and, apart from that, by ambitious structural reforms and a competitive economic framework, to enable the euro area to fully reap the benefits of the common currency.", "Structural

planned systems to market economies.", "Substantial progress has been achieved in the areas of property rights, privatization, as well as capital and trade liberalization.", "As these countries have anchored their institutional structures to the EU, they are viewed as increasingly secure places for investing and doing business in general.", "Moreover, the euro serves as an anchor of monetary stability in the region, often directly, for instance in the framework of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism ERM II.", "Currently, six countries of the 12 new Member States participate in the exchange rate mechanism ERM II: Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovakia.", "All Member States of the EU, with the exception of Denmark and the United Kingdom, are to adopt the euro,

continue.", "For the three EU members Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, and also for Russia, the staff of our Bank forecasts annual real GDP growth to range between 5% in the Czech Republic, 6% in Poland and 6 1\u20442% in Russia, while economic activity in Hungary is expected to slow down to less than 3% this year, as necessary austerity measures take effect.", "For 2008, our staff expects some growth acceleration for Hungary, and some moderation in the other countries mentioned.", "In the long run, the leveling off of EU accession-related and catching-up effects may dampen growth, but the general growth prospects remain favorable.", "Austrian companies in general, and Austrian banks in particular, identified market opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe at a relatively early stage and have established a considerable presence in the region by now.", "With an average market share in banking sector assets of almost 25%, Austria's banks are market leaders in Central and Eastern Europe.", "More than one-third of the profits of the six largest Austrian banks already come from this region.", "As Austrian banks continue to move into the southeast and east, their exposure is broadly diversified, which is intended to contain risks.", "At the same time, the Austrian authorities closely monitor potential challenges involved.", "Stress tests indicate that the banks'

imbalances.", "Recently, global growth appears to be somewhat more even-footed, as growth in Japan and the euro area has been picking up.", "The economic upswing recorded in the euro area can be
