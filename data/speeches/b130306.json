limiting the rate of year-over-year growth in expenditure, and the limitation for 2013 according to this law is growth of about 5 percent in expenditure.", "It will therefore be necessary to reduce planned expenses by 5 percent.", "We must remember that even if the government does this, there will still be a significant increase in government expenditure for 2013.", "In addition, in order to meet the deficit target, we believe that it will be necessary to increase receipts by about NIS 6 billion, or about 0.6 percent of GDP.", "Those who will need to decide where to cut will need to make

constantly take into consideration.", "We need to remember that the main factor in the increase of housing prices is the lack of supply.", "The increase in prices has led to the expected supply response: an increase in the number of building starts.", "This rate, which was 30,000 units per year, reached 44,000, which is a significant increase.", "However, the rate of land marketed by the State then declined, and the rate of building starts fell to 40,000 per year.", "According to the Israel Lands Administration, the problem is with the authorities approving building plans, without

wouldn't want to cause damage to the entire population in order to teach politicians how to act better.", "The problem of poverty in Israel is not easy to solve, since poverty is concentrated mainly in two population groups - the Ultra-Orthodox and the Arabs - although this is not to minimize the problem of poverty among the rest of the general population.", "However, among the ultra- Orthodox, less than half of men participate in the workforce, and among the Arabs, just 20 percent of women work.", "Therefore, we cannot deal with poverty by providing grants that will raise all of the poor above the poverty line due to the effect such a policy will have on employment incentives.", "We will need to find a solution to this complex problem.", "Observing both historic and expected demographic trends shows continued growth in the Arab and ultra-Orthodox segments of the population.", "If these labor market trends continue, we will reach a situation where half of the population

take out mortgage loans must take into account that the interest rate today is very low, and that when it rises, their monthly payments will rise as well.", "The Bank of Israel is limiting the leverage rate because when the time comes when the buyers can't meet their mortgage payments, that's when the problems start.", "These limitations mainly affect investors, and have less of an effect on those purchasing their first apartment.", "I like to quote the book, This Time is Different: During good time, everyone thinks the situation is good, prices are going up, and we know how to deal
