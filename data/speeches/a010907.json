picture.", "The flip side of the impressive catching-up process in Europe can be seen in what is recognised as a lack of economic convergence.", "And, most often in view of the national inflation rate, Ireland is being cited as an example.", "Well, then, what exactly is meant by \"convergence\"?", "The term is one with many facets.", "The Treaty of Maastricht set out to measure nominal convergence.", "You remember the fiscal and monetary criteria: inflation rate, capital-market rates, sustainable fiscal policy and exchange-rate stability.", "The Maastricht criteria were subject to heated debate in academia, as well as in policy circles.", "By no means are they mere history.", "On the contrary, they are very much alive.", "They are to be applied when further countries join the euro-currency area, be it the pre-ins like the UK or the accession countries.", "The Maastricht criteria, however, are in a way both \"stability criteria\" and \"convergence criteria\".", "They ensure

euro-area economy has been hit particularly hard by the oil and food crises.", "Both led to sharp price increases and put the consumer into a state of uncertainty.", "The oil price shock caused a negative terms-of-trade effect and major reductions in real disposable income.", "At this juncture, we see the economy of the euro area having lost momentum, after the vigorous expansion in the year 2000.", "There are, however, several reasons for feeling confident.", "The waning food crises will no longer weigh on consumption and this year's tax cuts are to come into effect in some euro-area countries.", "The risks are clearly on the investment side.", "A major part of the reduction in GDP growth during the first quarter - the latest data available - occurred owing to a lower contribution of gross fixed capital formation.", "Capacity utilisation is still high, and the global outlook does not call for stepping up investment.", "On the whole, business sentiment, and thus the propensity

favourable position, as they have enough room to manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers work in full.", "A minority of countries (Germany, Italy, France and Portugal) - which, however, account for 70 per cent of euro area GDP - still show structural deficits of a considerable extent.", "Under the present circumstances, therefore, the automatic stabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in

available evidence points to an improvement in the outlook for price developments.", "With regard to the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 was 5.9 per cent.", "However, this figure needs to be corrected for some holdings which do not necessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term.", "Regarding the second pillar, there are clear signs of lower inflationary pressures from the demand side.", "Lower growth expectations, a strengthening exchange rate, the downward trend of the growth of consumer and producer prices lead to the expectation that price stability will be restored in the not too distant future.", "Overall, as several indicators are pointing to an abatement of inflationary pressures, the new level of interest rates is compatible with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, which, in turn, is essential to create a favourable environment for sustainable economic growth.", "The evolution of the slowdown in the US highlights how important and how effective financial markets are.", "The speed at which the slowdown spread around the world underlines this importance.", "Changes in investment and in financing habits have altered the international links between the business cycles.", "For the first time since the mid-seventies oil crisis, the G-7 countries are slowing in step.", "Evidence is piling up that this synchronicity is more than sheer chance.", "Financial markets seem to more and more replace trade in goods and services as the major transmission channel for economic developments.", "The reasoning runs as follows: Financial market prices react immediately, once new information becomes available.", "So financial markets reflect

view of - let's say - the correctness of the markets' expectations as to the future path of ECB interest-rate policy.", "If his opinion differs from the markets', that is, if he perceives opportunities for arbitrage, he will rearrange his portfolio.", "What is new about this process - besides technology?", "International portfolio diversification is no longer a privilege of institutional investors.", "Today, nearly everybody's portfolio is internationally diversified.", "International portfolio diversification may occur in its direct form, for example, in holding shares in companies located in different countries.", "It may otherwise come in its indirect form: foreign direct investment.", "More and more often, companies substitute foreign direct investment for international trade.", "FDI flows are growing fast.", "The financial sphere in Europe has changed tremendously.", "We now have a common currency in the euro area.", "Currency risk has been eliminated.", "Financial markets are integrating faster than ever.", "They have become, and are still becoming, broader and deeper.", "Breadth and liquidity of financial markets, however, favour a capital-market-oriented financial system of Anglo-Saxon type.", "And disintermediation, in turn, fosters the breadth of capital markets.", "The broader and more liquid financial markets are, the more attractive they are to international investors.", "Thus, the euro is one of the forces working towards ever-closer financial links between national economies.", "Ever closer financial integration has times and again provoked calls to \"throw sand in the wheels of the foreign exchange market\".", "A \"Tobin tax\" on short-term currency transactions was proposed to bar excessive currency speculation.", "Such a tax would clearly lower transaction volume in international currency markets.", "However, it would come at too high a cost.", "Foreign trade in goods and services is bound to suffer as well.", "In the end, the wealth-enhancing international division of labour will be hampered.", "Furthermore, in times of distress, a Tobin tax is not effective.", "Expected returns on speculative capital movements during a crisis by far outweigh the costs of any sensible transaction tax.", "The Tobin tax simply cannot make up for a loss of confidence.", "On a worldwide scale, financial links are gaining in importance.", "Internationally, business cycles are growing closer.", "That is why Europe was relatively quickly affected by the US downturn, although our starting point was quite different from theirs.", "Although growth in Europe was vigorous, too, overheating was not an issue with us.", "The financial services industry is very dynamic not only, but especially, in Ireland.", "Sophisticated new products, new technologies, new channels of delivery and new forms of cooperation among hitherto separate lines of business pose new risks.", "As the financial world evolves, financial supervision faces new challenges.", "\"Basle II\" is one instrument for financial supervisors to take these new risks into account.", "The three pillar approach seeks to bring required minimum capital more into line with economic risk.", "Second, it brings banks' risk profiles and their ability for risk management closer into the focus of financial supervisors.", "And, third, enhanced disclosure will bring about more transparency and even will integrate financial markets into financial supervision.", "It is no accident that new models of financial supervision are being put into practice in several countries.", "Ireland has decided on a new model, and Germany is also in the process of devising a new institutional structure for its supervisory authorities.", "In both our countries, the role of the central bank in the supervisory task is affected.", "In March, the ECB published its views on the role of central banks in prudential supervision.", "The ECB argued in favour of a strong involvement of central banks.", "That view is well-founded.", "In all major industrial countries, the responsibility for the stability of the financial system is assigned to the central bank.", "Macro- and microprudential analyses, however, are intertwined.", "If you want to assess the risks to the system, you need to know about the players.", "If you want to assess individual risks, you need to know about their exposure to systemic risk.", "Central banks are required to oversee the smooth functioning of payment systems, another source of systemic risk.", "During the conduct of monetary policy, central banks collect information which is of use in the supervision of individual financial institutions.", "Interlinking central bank functions and prudential supervision takes advantage of these synergies.", "In Germany, the envisaged reform of financial supervision is linked to the reform of the Bundesbank.", "In its statement on the planned reform of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the ECB made it clear how valuable the independence of a central bank is - institutional independence, personal independence and financial independence alike.", "The Maastricht Treaty set out to protect central bank independence in all three regards.", "Article 108 of the Treaty explicitly protects both the independence of the ECB and the independence of all the national central banks within the ESCB.", "Any central bank reform at the national level must likewise respect such independence.", "Ladies and Gentlemen!", "Today, financial integration is one of the distinctive features of the world economy.", "Ireland has been in a position to exploit this development to its advantage.", "The catching-up has indeed been impressive, and is encouraging in view of the upcoming eastward enlargement of the European Union.", "Recent developments suggest that business cycles are linked more closely in a world of deeper financial integration.", "For the eurozone, this is particularly good news, as it facilitates the conduct of the single monetary policy.", "The ESCB has been successful in pursuing a stability-oriented monetary policy.", "Its strategy and recent monetary policy decisions will contribute to more growth and stability in Europe.", "In 118 days the physical introduction of the euro will bring the single European currency to completion.",
