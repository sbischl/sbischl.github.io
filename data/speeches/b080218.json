"Some argue that, while laudable, the European values are no longer compatible with the harsh realities of the modern world and the social models need urgent reform.", "The modern world is characterized by ever intensifying competition brought up by globalization.", "At same time the ageing of population sets pressure on the labour market and public finances.", "So, is the distinctly European combination of social values and economic policies an issue of the past, a promise that can no longer be fulfilled?", "Or is it possible to reconcile it with the forces of globalization and demographic change without stifling economic dynamism?", "Should it be seen as an asset or as a liability?", "Indeed, we can find examples that show how some features of a traditional welfare state have acted as a drag on economic growth.", "On the other hand the Nordic countries provide for many an example on how collective risk sharing has promoted opening of economies and adjusting to globalisation.", "Variety of European social models Your compatriot, a Belgian professor Andre\u0301 Sapir (2005) has divided the EU-15 countries into four groups based on their efficiency and equity.", "Efficiency here refers to sufficient incentive to work so that employment rates get relatively high.", "Equity1 in these models means keeping the risk of poverty relatively low.", "Although all these models share some common European values, there are some basic differences between them.", "The Mediterranean Model has rather low coverage of unemployment benefits increasing risk of poverty.", "On the other hand strict employment protection regulations have contributed to low levels of employment.", "So Professor Sapir classifies these countries to the group with \"low equity and low efficiency\".", "Social spending is much concentrated on old-age pensions.", "Early retirement provisions are an important part of the social welfare systems.", "In the Continental Model

equality and efficiency.", "The Nordic model has attracted considerable interest because it seems to be able to combine a high level of social protection and relatively equal income distribution with high economic dynamism.", "The individuals are not usually able to insure themselves against the risk of losing their job or finding their skills outdated.", "The above mentioned Nordic group of economists3 argue that it is the collective risk sharing by the welfare state and the labour market that facilitates acceptance of globalisation.", "The traditional institutional system of the Nordic labour market has based on coordinated negotiations between strong partners and supporting policies by the government.", "The group argues that this may be seen as a way of offering security to

voter.", "Without such a match, the funding base of the public sector (taxes) will inevitably start to erode.", "This could lead to a vicious circle that would be difficult to reverse.", "This underlines the need to keep the welfare services universal (open to all) and high quality.", "A good example of this is the school system.", "When the labour contribution to growth will be small or even negative, the role of productivity will grow in weight.", "Even though it is difficult to measure productivity in the public sector, in aggregate terms it appears to be lower than in the rest of the economy and in particular in the open sector (Baumol effect), and grows more slowly if at all.", "Still I am convinced that there are ways to increase productivity in the public services, too.", "The use of information technology and parallel re-engineering of work processes and organisations, as well as incentive based wage systems and benchmarking with best practices can bring improvements also in the productivity in the public sector.", "One way is to expose part of the public services to private competition, when provision of public services does not require that they are all produced by public sector.", "However, the main question is, whether the economic growth will be strong enough to bear the heavy cost burden that the ageing causes.", "The smaller number of working age population must be able to bake a cake big enough to feed the increasing share of population that is outside the labour force.", "Meeting the challenges - the Nordic model and Finnish experiences The Nordic model includes a large government sector, high tax rates, generous social protection and compressed wage structures.", "However, the standard economics text-books teach us that such features generally distort incentives for efficient resource allocation.", "This notwithstanding, during the past decade the Nordic (EU) countries have achieved higher growth rates than the advanced European countries on average.", "The Nordics have been able to achieve high employment combined with macroeconomic stability.", "Part of the strong economic performance in the Nordic countries can also be attributed to luck - both bad and good.", "As for the bad luck, there was a serious sharp economic downturn in Finland and Sweden in the early 1990s.", "Seen afterwards, it was to some extent a blessing in disguise.", "This is because it gave impetus to structural reforms and disciplined macroeconomic policies that ushered in a strong recovery from the recessions.", "As for the good luck, both Finland and Sweden have been lucky to have been in the vanguard of the mobile phone technology during its explosive growth phase.", "During the last 10 years the average economic growth in the Nordic countries has been stronger than in the EU-15 in average.", "Does the good economic performance of Nordic countries mean that the economics textbooks are wrong and that incentives and markets do not really matter that much?", "The answer is a resounding no.", "In fact, the strong macroeconomic performance in the Nordic countries owes a lot to policies that are well in line with recommendations of mainstream economics.", "So, does the Nordic model offer a way to reconcile the European ideals with the demands of the global economy?", "Are there some practises and solutions in the Nordic model that could be applied in other European countries?", "To answer this question, we need to look more closely at the Nordic experience.", "Substantial product market deregulation has helped underpin economic growth in the Nordic countries.", "This deregulation took place earlier than in most other European countries and the level of product market regulation in the Nordics is low by European standards.", "The collective risk sharing included in the Nordic social model has decreased the political resistance to such development.", "It has got easier for people to accept liberalisation of trade and globalisation when they feel they have some personal shelter against income fall caused by unemployment or other reason.", "Public finances in the Nordics are in better shape than in most other European countries although the welfare services are generous.", "Their debt ratio is low and annual budgets are on the surplus.", "The price of this has been the high taxation.", "But also disciplined fiscal policy has contributed to the fiscal balance and created an environment in which consumers and businesses can plan for a longer term.", "Sound monetary policies have also been instrumental in supporting growth.", "\u2022 Strong and transparent institutional framework.", "An institutional environment in which contracts can be enforced and property rights can be established promotes economic growth.", "Increasingly, all European countries share such an institutional environment.", "However, The Transparency International rates the Nordic countries in the top ten at to the transparency and integrity of their public sector.", "The importance of education and research and development So, good policies, sound institutions and some luck go far in explaining the strong performance of the Nordic countries.", "However, by digging a bit deeper, we can see also the crucial role of education and investments in R&D.", "The Nordic countries share a long-tradition of emphasising the importance of education.", "Nordic countries, particularly Sweden and Finland have high public and private spending on Research and Development, comparable with that of the United States.", "The particular character here is a close partnership between public and private sector.", "This has also fostered innovation in the environment of an open economy.", "OECD has recently publicized a third so called PISA-study.", "Finland has performed well in all three studies.", "It was emphasized in the study that good performance in Finland did not differ between the regions and correlated less with family background than in most countries.", "In a small country it is important to get all the talent resources in efficient use.", "The education is here the main tool.", "Nowadays, the share of the working age population with upper-secondary education, as well as tertiary education, is considerably higher in the Nordic countries than in the other EU countries on average.", "Moreover, the participation rates for non-formal job-related continuing education and training are exceptionally high in the Nordic countries.", "The Nordic economies have benefited from a well-educated labour force.", "The skilled labour force has contributed to a rapid diffusion of information and communication technologies, thus contributing to favourable productivity developments.", "The causality between democracy and prosperity may run both ways.", "However, a wellfunctioning democracy becomes even more vital to economic growth as a country becomes more prosperous.", "This is because the richer countries need to rely primarily on \"smart growth\", that is, increasing total factor productivity through innovation and technological change, while the poorer ones can grow robustly for long periods merely by imitating more advanced countries and adding more inputs of labor and capital.", "Conclusions So, what is the answer to the question that I posed at the beginning, i.e., is a social model based on European values an asset or a liability?", "As is often the case in real life, the answer is: \"it depends\".", "In a rapidly changing environment any static model is likely to become a liability.", "Indeed, economic systems are so complicated that no single policy prescription can ensure rapid and sustainable growth over the long run.", "Therefore, it would be helpful to shift the focus from copying particular \"models\" to analysing what structures are needed to support successful and adaptable approaches.", "I have attempted to do so by examining the experience of the Nordic countries, especially Finland.", "This experience suggests that it is possible - even not without pain - to combine economic dynamism with a system that is consistent with the core European values.", "The sound macroeconomic policies and social insurance typical for Nordic labour market decrease the need for stringent employment protection legislation.", "What lessons could we draw from the Nordic experience?", "Sound macroeconomic policies are fundamental as well as structural reforms that promote competition.", "And we should not underestimate the role of high-quality public institutions, especially in education and research, in supporting both economic growth and a democracy that is open to new ideas and change.", "Going forward, European values of solidarity and social cohesion will be tested by centrifugal forces arising from globalization, rapid technological advances and population ageing.", "Ensuring that these values are truly reflected in European social models will require many painful decisions, and we must be mindful of the dangers of populism.", "This calls for a frank and honest political discourse that recognizes the benefits and downsides of globalization and other forces that shape the future.", "This, combined with a welleducated electorate, and a culture of transparency provide a powerful antidote against populist policies.", "To survive and thrive in the global competition, Europe must not be focused on preserving structures; it needs to embrace change in order to preserve its core values.", "This requires innovation not only in business but also in social models."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
