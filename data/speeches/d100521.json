Kohn at the Federal Reserve has put forward on several occasions.", "He considers that three conditions I mentioned earlier must be met before central banks \"lean against the wind\".", "And these are the three arguments I mentioned earlier.", "The first condition is that it must be possible to identify a bubble sufficiently early and with sufficient certainty.", "Secondly, the assessment must be that there is a good chance that a slightly higher interest rate will really slow down the untenable developments.", "Finally, one must count on being able to gain \"enough\" by preventing a bubble in relation to what a tighter monetary policy might cost in the short term.", "I believe that most people will agree that these are sound conditions to use as a foundation.", "However, the views regarding when the conditions are actually met can vary.", "Professor Kohn's first condition probably entails the greatest difficulty.", "Although we are constantly developing our forecasting methods and models and they are becoming increasingly sophisticated, I do not expect that we will be able to reach a stage in the foreseeable future where we can be entirely sure that something we assess as an incipient bubble actually is a bubble.", "This is largely due to the nature of things, or rather the nature of the bubble.", "So when it comes to making assessments of what risks becoming a bubble, I believe that we must continue to make use of our experience combined with a dose of the sort of conclusion referred to in English-speaking circles as a \"duck test\"; if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.", "Of course what we are talking about here is much more difficult to identify than a duck.", "But if there are sufficiently strong indications that developments are untenable, then there is a good probability that this is the case.", "And if this is expected to affect inflation and developments in the real economy, I consider the interest rate to be a possible weapon if others are not available or not sufficient - if not to prevent a bubble, then at least to tone down the bubble and its consequences.", "House prices today and in the coming period So what does this reasoning entail for my views on developments in house prices and lending today?", "Firstly, the crisis has meant that the repo rate has long been adjusted to try to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis on inflation, production and employment and to give support to the economic recovery.", "The repo rate is still at the historically low figure of 0.25 per cent, but the Executive Board of the Riksbank is assuming that it will be time to leave the crisis rate and to conduct a monetary policy that is adapted to a \"normal\" downturn when we reach the summer or the early autumn.", "The low interest rates have probably contributed to households borrowing and investing more in housing than they would have done otherwise.", "But this was to some extent the intention, and a means of maintaining economic demand.", "We have quite simply conducted, and are conducting, the policy we consider necessary to attain the inflation target and to give sufficient support to production and employment.", "Swedish house prices have developed surprisingly strongly Swedish house prices have grown surprisingly strongly during the crisis, and also during the years prior to the crisis.", "House prices have risen fairly quickly, both in nominal and real terms.", "And it is not surprising that eyebrows may be raised when house prices are rising and bank lending to households is increasing fairly substantially, at the same time as unemployment is still high and growth has not yet begun to pick up.", "But in an international comparison things may not look quite so remarkable.", "During the years prior to the crisis real house prices in many other countries increased more than those in Sweden.", "During parts of 2006 house prices in Denmark, for example, rose at an annual rate of more than 20 percentage points, which was way above the Swedish increase.", "In the countries where real house prices had previously increased more rapidly than in Sweden, they have in most cases experienced fairly large price falls in connection with the crisis.", "For instance, in Denmark real house prices have fallen by around 20 per cent since the peak levels in 2007.", "So are developments in the Swedish credit and housing market cause for concern?", "My view is - not in the short term.", "But nor do I believe that the growth we have seen in household borrowing and house prices over the past decade is sustainable in the long term.", "The reason I do not believe developments to be a problem right now is that there are nevertheless reasonable explanations for the price increases.", "Recently it is probably the case that factors such as the fact that it is still cheap to borrow, and that households and companies according to indicators are regaining confidence, have contributed to the nevertheless strong development.", "There has also been relatively little new housing built in recent years, at least in relation to demand.", "The housing market is what one might call \"regionally segregated\" and migration to metropolitan areas has put upward pressure on house prices in these areas.", "Prices have also increased by far the most in Stockholm, Go\u0308teborg and Malmo\u0308.", "And then we do not have the same element of speculation in the Swedish housing market as in, for instance, Australia and to some extent the United Kingdom.", "What I mean here is the phenomenon that households buy housing as a financial investment and then rent it out, which may contribute to imbalances building up.", "This type of activity is not profitable in Sweden in the same way.", "There are several reasons for this, but the most important ones are probably the tax system and rent legislation.", "In Sweden we usually buy a house to live in rather than as a financial asset.", "However, having said this I would nevertheless like to say a word of caution.", "It is quite right to wonder whether the developments in recent years are actually sustainable.", "Households' debts in relation to incomes peaked at around 120 per cent in connection with the crisis in the 1990s.", "Today this figure is almost 170 per cent!", "Also at the beginning of the 1990s many models and fundamental driving forces behind house price developments pointed to there not being a serious over-valuation in the property market.", "Nevertheless prices fell in many areas by around 30 per cent!", "Such a development could affect the real economy and thereby also the conditions for monetary policy.", "Untenable in the long run Although I cannot see any problems right now, I do not believe that nominal house prices can continue to increase by an average of well above 7 per cent a year as they have done since the start of the 2000s.", "This is not sustainable in the long term.", "And when we now consider when is the best time to begin raising the repo rate, my colleagues and I will be carefully examining variables such as house prices and lending.", "As I pointed out, for instance, in connection with the monetary policy meeting in February, I believe that during the interest rate increase phase ahead of us it might be appropriate to \"lean against the wind\" - to emphasise some concern by raising the repo rate slightly sooner than we might otherwise have done.", "But as I also said then, monetary policy is not the most effective means if one wishes to slow down, for instance, house price developments slightly.", "I then said I would like to see measures such as Finansinspektionen setting a limit for the loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages.", "Now they have presented a proposal for this and we will carefully monitor its effects.", "Leaning against the wind concerns, in my view, avoiding large fluctuations in inflation and the real economy - what provides the best-balanced monetary policy.", "It is thus about monetary policy, not financial stability.", "As shown in a survey made by Finansinspektionen earlier this year, there are many indications that the households taking on loans are those that can afford to borrow.", "The Riksbank has also drawn this conclusion so far in its Financial Stability Reports.", "I therefore find it difficult to believe that the developments in the housing and credit markets at present would constitute any danger to the banks and thus to financial stability.", "Concluding remarks In connection with dramatic events like the recent financial crisis, proposals for radical changes tend to crop up in the general debate.", "But I do not see a radically-different monetary policy ahead of me.", "I am still convinced that flexible inflation targeting is the best monetary policy solution for Sweden.", "The repo rate is not the most effective weapon for trying to prevent or alleviate an imbalance in, for instance, the property market, but this does not mean it is completely ineffective.", "We must become better at analysing financial conditions and not least at capturing variables such as house prices and credit growth in our forecasts.", "And this is something we are working hard to achieve, both at the Riksbank and in many other areas.", "We must become better at clearly explaining how we assess the risks of a bubble given a particular repo rate policy, and what consequences a bubble may have if it bursts.", "And we need, and will most probably also obtain, better support from the framework for financial stability that we and others are now working to develop both in Sweden and abroad.", "When this project is complete, it will contribute to monetary policy more rarely needing to take into account untenable developments in the housing and credit markets.", "But I do not think we can achieve an entirely \"bubble-free\"
