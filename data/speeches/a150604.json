impact of financial risks on its own balance sheet and that of the system as a whole.", "This combines 1) the effective management of risk exposures and the enforcement of a binding governance culture at the bank level and 2) the regulatory oversight and mitigation of systemic pressures that may be developing.", "This is the specific context of what we euphemistically refer to as an \"enabled
