functioning cooperatives can be supported by banks to increase outreach.", "Sponsor banks have a specific responsibility in this regard and need to take ownership for their sponsored RRBs.", "Unlike

banking penetration is high.", "HR, technology and processes and leadership issues need to be addressed if RRBs are to fulfill what is expected from them.", "Last but not the least, the role of the State Governments in facilitating financial inclusion is critical.", "Land settlement rights, computerization of land records, and providing economic and social infrastructure with pro-active
