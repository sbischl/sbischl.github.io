price stability, maintained stability of the exchange rate and the provision of additional liquidity to banks also contributed to the preservation of business and consumer confidence, while the moratorium led to higher disposable income of corporates and households.", "(Slide 13) Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that in times of crisis Serbia's credit rating has been preserved, and even improved, according to Moody's.", "The result becomes even more significant when I add the fact that in the period from February 2020 to April 2021 almost 60 countries had their credit rating downgraded.", "All three rating agencies - Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch estimated that Serbia faced the pandemic in a much better macroeconomic position and with significantly narrowed imbalances relative to ten years ago.", "The improvements that stand out relate to the achieved and preserved low and stable inflation, relative stability of the exchange rate, adequate level of FX reserves and stronger fiscal position.", "As confirmed by concentration indices, the agencies also emphasise the higher sectoral and geographical diversification of investments and exports, enabling more balanced economic growth.", "They also state full coverage of the current account deficit by the FDI inflow, unlike the situation before the global financial crisis of 2008, when portfolio investments, as the most volatile category of inflows, were the dominant source of financing of the then twin deficit.", "They estimate that the responsible conduct of economic policy has created room for the adoption of extensive monetary and fiscal measures that have mitigated the effects of the pandemic and created conditions for economic growth.", "They conclude that political stability, with the majority support for President Vuc\u030cic\u0301's politics, is a guarantee of the continuity of sound economic policies, which is among the key factors that bring Serbia closer to the investment grade.", "What lies ahead of us?", "Although the fight against the pandemic continues, with everything that has been done, it is now easier to look ahead, to plan and think about how to provide citizens with a higher standard of living and how to further improve our competitive position.", "What do the projections and movements of different indices and composite indicators tell us?", "(Slide 14) Given that there is a significant degree of correlation between the corporate financial conditions index and GDP trends, this index can also be used as one of the economic activity indicators.", "The dynamics of its movement in 2020, indicating that exceptionally favourable conditions of corporate financing have been preserved, suggests that we can expect financial conditions to provide a positive contribution to economic recovery in the coming period as well.", "(Slide 15) In 2021, we expect a two-digit growth rate of Serbian commodity exports, which passed the resilience test in practice last year.", "This growth will be led by supply-side factors - further growth in investments in export-oriented sectors, but also by the recovery of external demand, supported by the expected successful vaccination process worldwide.", "Successful vaccination should also help create the conditions for the recovery of services, primarily tourism and transport.", "In the first quarter of this year Serbia recorded a (of current account surplus close to EUR 160 mn) as a result of the improvement of all current account components, mostly trade, with exports rising 16.6% and imports declining 0.2%, y-o-y.", "(Slide 16) Furthermore, during the pandemic striking an optimal balance between short-term support for people's health and the economy and medium-term sustainability of public finances has been one of the major challenges for policy makers across the world.", "In the February Inflation Report, we provided a composite indicator of fiscal sustainability for Serbia and assessed that the additional measures that were announced at the time, and adopted thereafter, did not threaten the sustainability of public finances.", "Based on the decomposition of factors affecting the movements in the share of public debt in GDP, we estimated that the key role in the dynamics of this indicator is that of robust economic growth and favourable terms of financing, which will ensure that public debt-to-GDP ratio moves at around 60% this year, and steadily declines in the medium term.", "I repeat - we have preserved the prospects for growth and development.", "(Slide 17) Our projection of core inflation suggests that inflation will remain low and stable in the coming period under the following assumptions -a relatively stable exchange rate, anchored inflation expectations, moderate wage growth and low inflation in the euro area.", "Nothing is comes on its own.", "People are the ones who adopt policies and measures that provide for such conditions.", "At the same time, there is a global discussion regarding possible tightening of financial conditions and further capital flows toward emerging economies.", "Also, rising global prices of primary commodities, driven primarily by optimism over the acceleration of global economic growth, reflect on the higher global inflation.", "However, for now, the prevailing view is that this increase in inflation is temporary, and eading central banks continue to stimulate favourable terms of financing with their monetary policies.", "(Slide 18) Preserving good prospects means that certain assumptions are met - and one of the common denominators for all of them is stability and confidence, meaning the continuity of sound policies!", "Continuity of sound policies, but without falling into the trap of Hume's paradox, because improvements are always possible.", "That is one of the key answers to the many uncertainties that lie ahead.", "Like I said - nothing comes on its own, people create and maintain stability.", "With everything that has been done, the basis has been created for the formal entry of Serbia into the investment grade spectrum, i.e.", "into the group of countries where, according to numerous indicators, we already belong.", "Let me remind you that with the issue of the ten-year eurobond in dollars in November 2020, with the simultaneous FX hedging operation, our country achieved the lowest price of financing thus far in the international financial market - 1.066%.", "Most of the funds raised in this transaction were used for the early repayment of a significant part of the remaining debt under expensive dollar eurobonds issued in 2011 at a high yield rate of 7.50%.", "This way, even during the crisis, Serbia continued the practice of responsible behaviour replacing the previously agreed expensive dollar debts by cheaper ones.", "According to the assessment of rating agencies, in order to move to the investment-grade rating, we need policy continuity, further growth in exports and FX reserves, continued FDI inflow and sustainable public finances.", "As all of this is \"in line\" with our medium-term projections, we estimate that Serbia will have an investment grade within a relatively short period.", "Serbia is also facing work on the \"Green Agenda\".", "As for the NBS, I can promise that we will not allow the activities of the central bank to be the basis for any greenwashing, whereby funds intended for environmental projects are used for other purposes.", "Considering that this forum is intended to be a \"two-way street\", I invite everyone present to give their contribution by personal example, because it is not only economic policy makers that should be aware of this, but also each and every individual.", "We all can and must give our contribution.", "You will also talk about digital economy and creative industry.", "I am sure that Ana will speak about how far Serbia has come in this field, because the task of the institutions is to make people's lives and business easier so that they can use time, as the most precious resource, in the best way possible.", "For more than two and a half years now, payment service users in Serbia can make instant payments quickly, safely and easily, at any time, from any place.", "Payees also receive funds quickly.", "This is possible thanks to the cutting-edge technology of the NBS IPS system, in which, since October 2018, around 47 million transactions have been executed, with a total value of around RSD 445 bn.", "For us, this is the only real indicator that instant payments have become the standard quality of service for payment service users in Serbia.", "We all also quickly got used to the possibility to pay in just a few seconds monthly bills of the largest service providers with the standardised NBS IPS QR code using our mobile banking applications.", "Today, instant payments are available at merchants' points of sale and electronic points of sale, and several online merchants have enabled instant payments in their internet shops.", "Among the first in Europe, the users of financial services in Serbia can also conclude distance contracts on financial services.", "They can do so with full transparency, security and protection of their rights.", "Opening a payment account, or applying for a payment card or a loan is possible without going to the bank, which proved to be very practical during the pandemic, when it was important to provide financial services and maintain health at the same time.", "What do the figures tell us?", "Last year, the number of distance contracts concluded increased by around 62% relative to 2019, and the number of contracts concluded with the use of video identification of users is also on the rise.", "We are facing a period of even greater use of these options.", "However, here, too, I want to repeat that innovation makes life easier, but technologies must serve people, and not the other way round.", "They are instruments for achieving goals, not the goal in itself.", "Technology alone cannot solve economic challenges: it cannot set priorities or make decisions about spending or investments.", "Only people can do that.", "That is why knowledge and human capital remain one of the key drivers of development and change in the 21st century.", "Respected participants of the Business Forum, I don't think anyone can declare victory over the coronavirus or an end to the fight for even greater growth and a better quality of life.", "I think there are no final victories, in life or economy.", "Also, I think that the pandemic hasn't changed the reform momentum.", "Since we are here today in the \"Ivo Andric\u0301\" hall, there's no one better to quote but him: \"Whoever does good is expected to give even more good.\"", "I believe that we lack neither progress nor tasks.", "It is our obligation and task to leave a stronger country to future generations and to preserve the foundations of growth despite the pandemic, because life must go on once the pandemic is over.", "We continue to fight for every job, for greater ease of life and business and for a better future for our children.", "And because of this, I am sure that everyone in Serbia, President Vuc\u030cic\u0301 above all, will do everything that this year's growth exceeds all our estimates!", "of the NBS, I can promise that we will work as so far -
