the large and volatile capital flows.", "The Pros and Cons of International Capital Flows There is a strong a priori case that international capital flows are a Good Thing.", "The obvious analogy is with international trade.", "If it is beneficial for nations to trade in goods and services, then there is a presumption that there will also be advantage in trading in saving.", "Financial flows supplement domestic saving, allowing more investment to be done in those countries where returns are highest; they buffer the variations over time between exports and imports; foreign direct investment brings the advantages of technological transfer; there are gains for savers from diversification; and, to complete the case for free capital flows, we should record the argument that even speculative capital flows can serve a beneficial purpose.", "Capital flows are generally supported by the economic profession, both academics and practitioners.", "Open capital markets are part of the widely-accepted Washington Consensus (whose twin elements are that countries should deregulate, and should open their economies to the outside world), and are endorsed by the IMF.", "Why, then, does foreign capital flow rank as a central element in the Asian crisis?", "The short answer is: painful experience in the practical world.", "Contrast Keynes' (1919) views on the pre-WWI world, with his later views on the prospective post-WWII world, transformed by the experience of the 1930s.", "He describes pre-WWI London, with evident approval, this way: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth .", "; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages .", "He regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.\"", "9-10) This was, as Keynes noted, a \"paradise\" in which \"internationalisation was nearly complete in practice\".", "Contrast this idyllic civilised picture I am grateful for the help of John Hawkins, Suzanna Chiang and Amanda Thornton in preparing this paper.", "This is not to downplay the deficiencies in domestic policies, which have been discussed elsewhere.", "For some discussion of the other \"twin\" problem - financial sector fragility - see Grenville (1997 and 1998b).", "The best known proponent of this argument is Milton Friedman, who has argued that speculation is inherently stabilising, as any speculator who does not buy cheap and sell dear (thus driving the price towards its fundamental equilibrium) will quickly go out of business.", "More recent literature is less confident of this result.", "The IMF Managing Director recently put forward seven building blocks for a stronger financial system, with the first three relating to globalisation: \"The first of these building blocks is the tremendous potential for growth and prosperity globalization provides countries fully integrating into the global economy.", "Formidable sources of dynamism are there, engendered by new information technologies and unifying financial markets.", "The second building block is integration.", "By integrating themselves into the mainstream of the globalizing world economy, the poorest countries will avail themselves of a most powerful instrument of acceleration of development.", "The third building block is the universal consensus on the importance of an increasingly open and liberal system of capital flows in order for globalization to deliver on its promises.\"", "with the world Keynes envisaged as he wrestled with the problem of reconstruction after the Second World War: \"it is widely held that control of capital movements, both inward and outward, should be a permanent feature of the post-War system.", "\"5 \"Experience between the Wars clearly demonstrated the mischief of unregulated capital movements, which take no account of the balance of trade available for overseas investment.\"", "The central point here is that some types of capital flows, for all their benefits, are very volatile.", "Policy-makers are not just interested in the growth of GDP, but its variance.", "Large volatile influences are a policy nightmare.", "The Asian Experience Private capital flow into the five troubled economies of Asia (South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines) was very large and variable, both up and down.", "It had reached almost US$ 100 billion in 1996 - one-third of worldwide flows into emerging countries.", "This was a five-fold increase over the 1990-93 average.", "It reversed in 1997, to record an outflow of US$ 12 billion.", "This turnaround was equivalent to more than 10 per cent of the GDP of these countries.", "Portfolio equity investment into these five countries almost quadrupled in a single year - 1993.", "These flows were huge, compared to the size of the domestic financial sectors.", "It is hardly surprising that the then-Governor of the Indonesian central bank said: \"we started building the foundations of a house but suddenly we had to host a party\".", "Kindleberger (1989), describing the post-OPEC period, captures the same point when he says: \"multinational banks swollen with dollars, .", "tumbled over one another in trying to uncover new foreign borrowers.\"", "(p. 26) Two other characteristics are worth noting: \u2022 almost 60 per cent of the 1996 private flows to the Asian Five were from foreign commercial banks and 40 per cent were short-term credits.", "Bank lending was flighty indeed - inflows of US$ 56 billion in 1996 turned into outflows of US$ 27 billion in 1997.", "Direct equity investment - which might be expected to be more stable - was quite modest (6 per cent of the total), but portfolio equity investment (which can -

the most famous of the hedge fund managers and a prime beneficiary of the current freedoms of capital flow - has suggested the setting up of an international credit insurance corporation.", "Henry Kaufman, the doyen of Wall Street economists, has urged the creation of an international supervisory structure, which would \"vet\" countries' prudential systems before allowing them to borrow in international financial markets.", "At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who argue that the main problem was \"lack of liquidity\" in these financial markets, which they identify as causing large price movements on relatively small volume changes.", "For the latter group, the solution is simple: to go harder, stronger and quicker towards full deregulation.", "Larry Summers (1998), US Treasury Deputy Secretary and former leading academic, draws an analogy with the advent of jet travel, which greatly improved convenience and safety of international travel, but when accidents happen, they are more dramatic.", "Should we, he asks rhetorically, address this problem by banning jet landings?", "To carry this analogy further, clearly the answer is to make the infrastructure safer for the most beneficial aspects of the innovation, while not precluding the possibility that the more dangerous aspects should be constrained.", "The Asian experience - following, as it does, similar experience in Mexico in 1994/95 - has set the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture.", "The G22 meeting held last month in Washington focused on three requirements: \u2022 transparency (i.e.", "greater information to help markets make more rational \u2022 strengthening of financial systems to make them more resilient in the face of changes of sentiment; \u2022 ensuring that the private sector bears a proper share of the burden of any rescue operation.", "All this makes good sense.", "To argue that more information is better than less information is as close to a truism as we can get in economics.", "Nor would any informed observer dispute the need for root-and-branch reform of prudential supervision in these countries.", "The issues here are not ones of principle, but are operational: how to put in place an enforceable set of rules which is sufficiently strict to protect the core of the financial system from crises, without making the rules so onerous that financing shifts elsewhere, to an unregulated but equally-vulnerable channel.", "The third area - private sector burden sharing - requires some elaboration.", "Despite the best endeavours on information/transparency and in building up prudential strength, it is hard to believe that the problems will be quickly and fully eliminated.", "For a start, a good prudential system will take many years to develop, considering that it requires counterpart improvement in accounting, legal and bankruptcy arrangements.", "Transparency is a good thing, but markets can make radical reassessments even when information is abundant - the October 1987 share market shake-out is evidence of this.", "And, realistically, domestic policy-makers will never be omniscient and single-minded in their pursuit of economic perfection.", "At present, the focus is on greater disclosure from capital-receiving countries, but this could be extended to greater disclosure from capital suppliers, including private intermediaries and investment funds.", "This focus revives an old issue in economics - the sequencing of reform.", "The old argument was that financial deregulation should come last, as the financial sector facilitated the exploitation of any remaining regulation-driven distortions in the economy.", "The new argument is that if financial deregulation precedes the establishment of a strong prudential framework, the inevitable volatility of capital flows will produce a collapse of the financial system.", "For an interesting discussion of the need for a \"global standard\", see Sheng (1998).", "Stiglitz (1998) puts it this way: \"We must bear in mind too in designing policy regimes (such as opening up capital markets) that we cannot assume that other aspects of economic policy, such as macroeconomic policy or exchange rates, will be flawlessly carried out.", "The policy regimes we adopt must be robust against at least a modicum of human fallibility.", "Airplanes are not designed to be flown just by ace pilots, and nuclear power plants have built into them a huge margin of safety for human error.\"", "If we accept that, with all the corrections made and \"best endeavours\" on the policy-making front, there will still be room for sharp breaks in confidence, then this has to be handled in the same way that it is handled domestically in the face of bank crises caused by loss of confidence - through the availability of a lender-of-last-resort.", "Mexico in 1994/95 provides a classic example of the international lender-of-last-resort in operation, and most observers would regard this as a success.", "Most people would also regard it as an example of the residual problem of the lender-of-last-resort - \"moral hazard\".", "This type of moral hazard occurs when those who take economic decisions are not required to accept the full consequences, when that decision turns out badly.", "In the case of the sudden capital outflow from Mexico in 1994, this outflow was replaced by an IMF/US package of US$ 50 billion, which was enough to pay out the government creditors, until confidence was restored (which occurred relatively quickly) There are those who argue that, in doing this, the foreign investors were \"bailed out\", and this sets a bad precedent for future investors.", "While the problem of moral hazard has long been recognised, and there was substantial discussion about how to address it following the Mexican rescue, subsequent events have demonstrated just how hard it is to avoid.", "In late 1997, foreign banks which had lent to Korean private banks were given an ex post government guarantee and concerted arrangements were put in place to avoid the impending default.", "If Mexico showed that creditors holding government debt can be bailed out and Korea showed that creditors holding bank debt can be assisted, then Indonesia may be providing an example, where foreign creditors holding debt of private firms are assisted.", "It is not hard to see why this occurs: while everyone is against moral hazard in principle, the resolution of particular problems often requires that special assistance be given to those who, by their actions, could make the current crisis worse.", "As Kindleberger (1989, p. 182) noted: \"Actuality inevitably dominates contingency.", "As with bankruptcy, in practice the balance needs to be drawn between the need to keep continuity of operations, against the need, also, to maintain appropriate incentives for risk-taking.", "While everyone agrees, in principle, that private investors should not be bailed out, administering the appropriate \"haircut\" is not operationally easy.", "Hence the question of private sector burden sharing on the G22 agenda.", "If the combination of moral hazard and the understandable reluctance of governments to enlarge the international lender-of-last-resort leaves the feeling that the problems have not been fully resolved, then a further - more controversial - element is on the agenda in some quarters.", "For some people, the problems of short-term capital flows outweigh their benefits.", "They argue that short-term flows bring little or no technological transfer.", "William Rees-Mogg (1998), former Editor of The Times, has put it this way: \"There is now a huge financial industry which is purely speculative in character; it centres on the currency trading of international banks.", "It is deeply resented in those countries which have been ravaged by its inflows and outflows, however much they may have contributed to their own misfortune.", "Because it is entirely short-term in character, casino capitalism makes little net contribution to long-term investment.\"", "\"It is impossible to pretend that the traditional case for capital market liberalisation remains unscathed.", "Either far greater stability than at present is injected into the international monetary system as a whole or the unavoidably fragile emerging countries must protect themselves from the virus of short-term lending, particularly by -

a quasi-tax which impinges more heavily on short-term flows.", "Note that the controls are on inflows, not outflows: the aim is to prevent the problem from arising, rather than attempt to clean up afterwards.", "No-one is arguing for countries to cut themselves off from the benefits of foreign capital.", "Rather, the aim is to see how the benefits can be reaped while minimising the risks from volatility: in short (returning to Larry Summers' analogy), how to make jet travel safer.", "As part of this process, there is more interest in ensuring that there are no positive incentives in favour of short-term flows, for example, via the BIS capital adequacy requirements, or via specific institutional arrangements such as the Bangkok International Banking Facility.", "The sort of reform discussed here is not going to be easy to implement.", "There is always a tension between those who favour a pure laissez-faire version of the market, and those who see a role for government in the international architecture.", "\"It is ironic: the age of globalisation may well be defined in part by challenges to the nation-state, but it is still states and governments by the practices they adopt, the arrangements they enter into, and the safety nets they provide - that will determine whether we exploit or squander the potential of this era.\"", "(Haass and Litan 1998, p. 6) Stiglitz (1998, p. 20) makes a similar point: \"in approaching the challenges of globalization, we must eschew ideology and over-simplified models.", "We must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.", "There are reforms to the international economic architecture that can bring the advantages of globalization, including global capital markets, while mitigating their risks.", "Arriving at a consensus about those reforms will not be easy.", "But it is time for us to intensify the international dialogue on these issues.\"", "Australia could, if it chooses, play a role in this dialogue, out of proportion to its modest standing in world affairs.", "The Asian crisis is the starting point of the reassessment of the international architecture: while our understanding of Asia and the crisis is imperfect and no doubt distorted in various ways, it may well be ahead of many of the larger countries which have tended to dominate the debate.", "We have well-developed links - across a variety of disciplines - with our The Australian experience with Variable Deposit Requirements in the 1970s is also relevant.", "There is a common view that these were ineffective, and it would certainly have to be acknowledged that regulations such as this are by no means watertight.", "But it is worth noting that, at one stage, they worked too effectively, and were a major reason behind the monetary squeeze of 1974, where the safety valve of capital flows was effectively blocked by the VDRs.", "Kindleberger (1989, p. 7), again, has a sensibly balanced view: \"The position that markets generally work but occasionally break down is widely at variance with the views at either of two extremes: that financial and commodity markets work perfectly in all times and places, or that they always work badly and should be replaced by planning or governmental assignments.", "On the contrary, I contend that markets work well on the whole, and can normally be relied upon to decide the allocation of resources and, within limits, the distribution of income, but that occasionally markets will be overwhelmed and need help.", "The dilemma, of course, is that if markets know in advance that help is forthcoming under generous dispensations, they break down more frequently and function less effectively.\"", "In Australia, for example, there was a well-informed and bipartisan discussion when these issues came before the Australian Parliament recently (House of Representatives, 26 March 1998), with both sides of politics exhibiting a depth of knowledge which has simply been absent from the legislative debate in America.", "In contrast, see, for example, Far Eastern Economic Review, 26 February 1998, p. 17.", "An Australian view may be less bound by narrow commercial interests than some others.", "We have, ourselves, experienced some of the problems of volatile international capital flows.", "We know something, too, of the trials, tribulations and benefits of a flexible exchange rate regime.", "Not least, because the international landscape matters more to us (as a small country on the periphery of a culturally-different and diverse region which is fundamental to our economic future), we care more, so we will try harder to improve our international environment.", "The current international economic architecture has evolved in response to the demands placed on it: many of these add-ons, lean-tos and ad hoc bricolage serve the purpose well enough.", "But the original floor plan was drawn up in an earlier era and - more importantly for us - the building committee was formed long ago and does not always represent today's economic realities.", "We are, of course, represented on the IMF Executive Board, but with more than 180 members, our voice is small.", "We have a seat at the Bank for International Settlements, but this remains a European-oriented institution.", "With the G22, we have a group that represents us and our geographical region in a way that did not occur in the older groups such as G10,25 but the future of this group is not assured: it represents a recognition that the old groupings need to be reworked, but this has yet to be done definitively.", "We have shown a readiness and ability to provide key inputs into international economic relations,26 but we need to see this as a priority issue if we are to have our voice heard in the Councils of the World, and we need persistence and patience to reinforce our credentials.", "More regionally-focused groups could give us extra leverage.", "APEC is, of course, the over-arching regional framework.", "There are, in addition, a variety of smaller and more specialised groups -
