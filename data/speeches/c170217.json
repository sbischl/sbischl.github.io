the institutional memory of the mistakes and behaviour that led to the crisis and that had such severe cost.", "And the LSE has been the scene of many important contributions to assessing what went wrong and to the building of the post-crisis regime, including from central bank governors, past and present.", "So I stand tonight on the shoulders of giants.", "But I want to simultaneously keep my feet firmly on the ground on the practice of macroprudential policy.", "It's now part of the framework of economic policy in the UK.", "Like monetary policy, it has a statutory policy committee to set it the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England.", "And yet, if you ask ten economists what precisely macroprudential policy is, you're likely to get ten different answers.", "So the time has come to take stock.", "I want to lay out what I believe to be five guiding principles for macroprudential policy.", "My aim in doing so is twofold: first, to help to build a common understanding of what it is and how it works; and second, to engage the finest minds you in partnership to push the frontiers of knowledge in ways that can make it better.", "\"It's the real economy, stupid\"2 The first of my five principles is the one that motivates the whole exercise of macroprudential policy.", "For all that macroprudential policy may seem to be about regulating finance and the financial system, its - borrowing from James Carville's famous election campaign advice - ultimate objective is: the real economy, stupid.", "It is captured more precisely by Eric Rosengren (President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston) as avoiding circumstances in which \"problems (or concerns about potential problems) within institutions, markets, payments systems, or the financial system in general ...substantially impact the expected path of activity.", "\"4 These problems typically arise when the financial system is overwhelmed by events in the economy;

loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit is that the PRA and the FCA should ensure that mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15% of their total number of new residential mortgages at LTI ratios at or greater than 4.5.", "The FPC recommendation regarding mortgage affordability is that when assessing affordability, mortgage lenders should apply an interest rate stress test that assesses whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if, at any point over the first five years of the loan, Bank Rate were to be 3 percentage points higher than the prevailing rate at origination.", "For further detail, see for instance Bank of England (2014) for a documentation of the Bank of England's 2014 housing market measures.", "An additional mechanism that creates amplification is that if and when these risks do materialise, market participants begin to doubt the solvency of even banks that are resilient.", "This is a form of what economists call 'Knightian' uncertainty (Knight, 1921); Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008) present a model based on this concept.", "In his classic paper on policymaking under uncertainty, Brainard (1967) argues that it will generally be optimal to use all instruments available when pursuing particular targets.", "This result holds provided the tools have less-than-perfectly correlated impacts on the target.", "In these circumstances, while any given tool may prove ineffective, it is less likely that their combined use will be.", "There is, therefore, an insurance benefit to using multiple tools in moderation.", "Under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012, the Bank of England has a statutory objective to protect and enhance the stability of the financial system of the United Kingdom.", "Subject to achieving this primary objective, the FPC must also support 'the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment' 9C(1) of the Bank of England Act 1998).", "The first signs of that can be seen in the work being conducted internationally and domestically to study and address risks around asset management, market liquidity and derivatives.", "For example, the FSB published a policy recommendation in January that funds' investment strategies should be consistent with their redemption terms, see Financial Stability Board (2017).", "The FPC has also noted declines in the liquidity of key dealer-intermediated markets, and the Bank is contributing to an international review of repo market Settlements' Committee on the Global Financial System, see Bank of England (2016).", "The FPC functioning by the Bank for International has also asked the Bank to complete an in-depth assessment of financial stability risks associated with derivative markets.", "This will examine progress towards implementation of the post-crisis reforms to these markets and consider implications for the resilience of the financial system.", "International Monetary Fund (2011) discusses the risk that macroprudential policy would be subject to biases toward inaction or insufficiently timely action, given that the benefits of policy interventions can appear uncertain while the costs are often felt more immediately.", "The policies introduced by the FPC in 2014 to guard against risks from the mortgage market do not apply to re-mortgages with no change to the principal amount outstanding.", "In July 2016, the FPC became the first macroprudential authority in an advanced economy to cut the so-called countercyclical capital That was consistent with the FPC's intention to release the countercyclical capital buffer in situations where risks buffer for banks.", "materialise, and to act pre-emptively before losses crystallise.", "This cut sent a clear signal that, if losses were to materialise, banks would be able to draw on their buffers, reducing any perceived need for banks' to preserve capital and restrict lending, with consequent negative impacts on the real economy.", "For details, see the FPC Record of meetings held on 28 June and 1 July, available at A classic view from Brainard (1967) is that uncertainty over the impact of a policy instrument should make a policymaker less active.", "Bahaj and Foulis (2016) show that this conclusion may not hold for the complex reality faced by a macroprudential policymaker.", "Specifically, the large costs of financial crises, the presence of unquantifiable sources of risk, the ability to learn from policy, and private sector uncertainty can all be supportive of bolder, more active policy."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary-financial coordination",
