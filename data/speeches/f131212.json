Jones and S&P 500 have reached new record levels, thereby exceeding the peaks attained prior to the global financial crisis.", "In addition, Japan's Nikkei Index and the most important western European stock exchange indices, including the Swiss SMI, have again recorded significant gains in recent months.", "Despite all the euphoria on the stock exchanges, we must not forget that it is not only the improvement in the economic outlook but also the continuation of the very expansionary monetary policy around the world which is behind this positive risk sentiment.", "In May and June we saw what could happen if expectations of a less expansionary monetary policy course become widespread in the market.", "At that time, the announcement by the US Federal Reserve of a possible reduction in its bond purchase programme caused share markets to plunge temporarily.", "The wave of selling did not recede until the beginning of July, when the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the

rising in June and July.", "Since then, they have largely moved sideways.", "This applies to US, UK, German and Swiss government bonds, in particular.", "Until the beginning of September, yields on ten-year Confederation bonds rose to almost 1.2%.", "They are currently at around 1%, which means that they have increased by about half a percent year-on-year.", "Government bonds in the emerging

these countries.", "By contrast, risk premia on government bonds for the peripheral euro area economies did not increase very much.", "Moreover, these risk premia have fallen again in the meantime so that returns on government bonds in the peripheral economies are now in fact lower than at the beginning of the year.", "This is probably due, not least, to progress in overcoming the crisis as well

reserves At the end of September 2013, our holdings of foreign exchange reserves stood at CHF 443 billion.", "I would now like to make a few comments on income from foreign exchange reserves.", "I should begin by stressing that monetary policy has priority over investment policy, and that generating income is not the primary objective of investment policy.", "We are guided, first of all, by the criteria of security and liquidity.", "The criterion of security covers primarily the reduction of risks such as market, credit and concentration risks.", "In addition, it is important for us to

to rise even when we do not need to purchase additional foreign exchange.", "The other component of returns is changes in the value of foreign exchange reserves.", "We value all investments at market prices and in Swiss francs.", "Consequently, changes in the prices of interest-bearing paper and shares as well as exchange rate movements have a direct impact on the net result for investment.", "If the Swiss franc strengthens against the investment currencies, this results in a valuation loss on the foreign exchange reserves.", "The chart shows the net investment result since the first quarter

the G20 countries.", "They involve not only central banks and supervisory authorities but also an international group of private sector financial market participants.", "They are examining, first, the

alternative interest rate benchmarks which would better meet the needs of the market and the requirements of supervisory authorities in the longer term.", "Alternatives to the Libor are being

specifically one-day terms.", "These transactions form the basis for the Swiss franc yield curve.", "The two benchmarks involved are, first, the TOIS fixing, which is used for interest rate

rate benchmarks.", "Although the level of activity on the money market remains persistently low, they continue to be available to the market as a basis for interest rate transactions in Swiss francs.", "However, the Libor retains its position as the most important interest rate benchmark in the money and capital markets."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
