for instance health care - are completely excluded from the Directive.", "Another factor in services that is sometimes overlooked is that of scale.", "In today's fragmented service market in Europe, there is insufficient pooling of resources to drive large-scale R&D initiatives, new distribution platforms and to increase competition between market participants.", "We therefore need to take a step back and consider what can be done to complete the European Single Market for services.", "To give an example, the original idea of applying the socalled country of origin principle should be reconsidered.", "This would mean that the regulation of the exporting country is applied.", "The benefits from such a change are straightforward: first, it becomes easier for a service provider that no longer has to deal with the regulations of 28 countries when exporting across the Union.", "Second, it would incentivise countries to put in place efficient and well-functioning legislation.", "In addition, the Single Market for services should be expanded to additional sectors: there is, for instance, no good economic reason for excluding health care.", "As I said earlier, reforms are also about improving economic governance.", "When the first European Semester was launched in January 2011, it marked a sea change in the economic governance of the euro area.", "With this new tool, Europe recognised that ex ante coordination of economic policies -
