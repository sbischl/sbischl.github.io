1970s and 1980s.", "Many of the economies experienced a quantum leap into the industrialisation process as trade flows expanded at double-digit rates during most of this period.", "While the East Asian economies benefited from this global trend, the economies have not however, been immune to external shocks arising from shifts in international demand.", "The economies were affected by factors such as swings in commodity prices, significant oil price adjustments, and the slowdown in the major economies.", "While the impact of these trade - related shocks on the domestic economies of the East Asian countries involved costs, in terms of slower growth and dampened domestic economic activity, these economies were able to adjust to the sudden changes.", "In such an environment, there was also greater predictability in the direction of the economic trends, providing the basis on which appropriate policy responses were implemented to manage the economic adjustment process.", "Emerging economies in particular, in the East Asian region participated in this globalisation process and benefited from the enhanced trade activities.", "In the recent decade however, there has been a distinct change in the nature of the globalisation process.", "Globalisation is no longer confined to trade and direct investment, but increasingly involves large cross- border financial flows.", "Over the recent decade, these financial flows have dominated the global market place.", "An emerging concern is that this trend would result in a widening of the divide between the developed and

are unconstrained by any regulatory framework, then size, the degree of development and the degree of resilience of economies will matter.", "Countries that are small, and have less developed economic

forward, it is recognized that a higher tolerance level to sudden changes in economic conditions and to the more volatile market conditions is necessary.", "Building such tolerance levels involves

based on an export-oriented industrialisation drive.", "This model, which is based on high savings and investments, has indeed served the region well.", "In the current environment of slower growth,

markets such as China.", "The share of East Asian exports to China has doubled in the past decade to about 10%.", "While there has been significant attention on the competition that China will create for other countries in the region, the focus should also be on the complementarities that are already feeding the regional growth process.", "A third discernable trend in the region is the growing importance of domestic demand in the regional economies, supported by domestic-oriented policies in recent years, which would ensure that the gains in intra-regional trade could be sustained.", "In terms of financial flows, the development of regional markets is contributing towards strengthening the prospects for a deepening of Asian financial markets and promoting greater regional financial

monetary co-operation, regional capacity building and the enhancement of skills and capabilities of regional financial regulators and policymakers.", "Regional surveillance and peer review in particular is an important step forward as it will contribute to confidence building and would complement the implementation of the various regional financing schemes.", "Significant progress has been made in achieving the objectives of the Chiang Mai Initiative to create swap facilities to provide emergency liquidity assistance for the region.", "Closer co-operative efforts in the standardisation

co-operation in these areas will augment the foundations for realising the tremendous potential that this region possesses for future growth and prosperity.", "Ladies and gentlemen, An important transformation in the international financial landscape is the introduction of the euro which has indeed been a defining event.", "The objective was clearly to facilitate trade and investment within

"Corporations dealing with the 12 euro countries are now able to keep their books in one set of accounts and make operating and investment decisions without having to be concerned about exchange rate changes.", "For the rest of the world, it has been described as \"island of price stability\" in addition to the dollar area, to which capital can flow.", "Four factors are important in determining a currency's international role: relative stability, which would reduce the risk of holding assets in that currency; a strong exchange rate; so that capital losses can be avoided; deep and liquid financial markets for that currency, to enable holders to diversify, liquidate and adjust their investment portfolios; and finally, a strong regulatory support to minimise the possibility of crises.", "Indeed, the international success of the euro in coming years would depend on the extent to which these criteria are met.", "The introduction of the euro has of course given impetus to other regional initiatives to pursue similar efforts to unify national currencies into a single regional currency.", "Such initiatives are being pursued in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.", "In ASEAN, a

currency would be a significant degree of economic and financial convergence and integration.", "It would also require greater labour and capital mobility in the region.", "While the single currency may be not in the region's immediate future, this does not preclude greater cooperation on exchange rate issues and other forms of financial co-operation among regional economies.", "There is indeed potential to benefit from enhanced financial cooperation and for the creation of mechanisms that would enable the region to better cope with periods of highly unstable financial market conditions.", "Institutional infrastructure such as regional surveillance and financial support mechanisms achieved under the Chiang Mai Initiative can be further enhanced over time to provide temporary liquidity support to regional countries and prevent the type of violent exchange rate movements observed during the Asian financial crisis.", "Such institutional arrangements need to be reinforced with greater regional economic integration.", "In addition, to encourage part of the financial flows from the region to be recycled into investments in the capital market, efforts have been taken to further develop the capital market, particularly in the area of securitization, credit guarantee and market infrastructure.", "The regional economies recognise the importance of developing the capital market.", "Thus, coordinated efforts through various initiatives have been undertaken to remove impediments to the development of these markets.", "Confronted by the current climate of uncertainty in

position to withstand external shocks and any slowdown in global growth.", "It is the underlying economic and financial foundations and its strength that will determine the capacity and resilience,
