thing or two about wars.", "He declared: In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning indispensable.", "I agree with Ike that we must have a battle plan.", "We must put our minds to the task of planning for both resilience and inclusive and sustainable growth, and audit the results on the triple bottom line.", "I can only reiterate my forlorn call for a strong and well-resourced strategic planning capacity at the heart of the policy-making establishment.", "For me there are seven essentials.", "First, become a learning country, not just adapting to change, but anticipating it, and thriving on Second, harness knowledge transfer, learning, and investment whether foreign or domestic, to increase our productive potential; Third, ensure life cycle education for all, as we adapt and re-adapt to a rapidly-changing Fourth, transform our universities into centres for R&D and innovation, and put undergraduate teaching online; Fifth, attract and retain our best talents offering international rates for the job, for them and for our migrant diaspora; Sixth, build a strong targeted social safety net, with business incubators, incentives for startups and skills development; Seventh, shift the employer of last resort from the public to the private sector, and harness technology for your business and for national welfare.", "Christine Lagarde at the IMF

import-dependent economy, can depreciate its way to development.", "The Central Bank is rightly concerned with the distributional effects of monetary policy.", "Borrowers have been subsidized for too

holders and increased inequality.", "As the US ends Quantitative Easing and normalises interest rates, we must prepare for greater currency volatility and changing market sentiment.", "The Central Bank will have its hands full in combating these pressures to ensure continued stability.", "We must always bear in mind that price stability and exchange rate stability engender social stability - and that is the public good we should all be working for.", "Without foresight, and concerted action now, we will leave a poor legacy for our children to live in a socially and environmentally
