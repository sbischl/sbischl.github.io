number of jobs lost and created.", "In the Netherlands, roughly 9.000 jobs are offshored each year, whereas the annual number of job destruction and creation is above 800.000.4 Since the ICT

would have moved to a permanently higher trend rate of productivity growth.", "The jury is still out on whether this is true.", "Other things equal, a higher real equilibrium interest rate implies that monetary policy interest rates also have to move to a higher level, consistent with the new equilibrium.", "So, a major issue is to determine the trend rate of productivity growth.", "From a

ambitious goal in a world with long and variable lags in monetary transmission.", "A clear focus on low and stable inflation can safeguard central banks against the temptation of activism.", "Given current uncertainties, monetary authorities must be particularly cautious in interpreting the output gap.", "They have to remain firm in reaction to actual inflation and other relatively reliable indicators of inflation risks, such as excessive wage growth.", "As a side remark, I add that, in theory, capital account liberalisation and trade openness warrant a sharper focus of monetary policy on price stability rather than output stabilisation.", "International capital mobility, as well as broader access to financial markets, creates new opportunities for households to smooth consumption over the years.", "Free international trade allows for specialisation in domestic production.", "As a result, it might be possible to disentangle consumption and production to a higher extent than in the past.", "In other words, households can cushion changes in production without intervention by the central bank.", "I would like to conclude with a warning.", "A focus on price stability is more complicated than it sounds.", "Low and stable consumer price inflation is no reason for complacency.", "In spite of consumer price stability, asset price inflation may signal underlying imbalances, such as an overoptimistic risk assessment by financial market participants that keeps long-term interest rates at unwarranted low levels.", "Monetary policymakers must be forward-looking, and assess
