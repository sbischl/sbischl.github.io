{"sentences": ["Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you all at the National Bank of Belgium and to open this ambitious twoday conference on population ageing.", "The steadily increasing life expectancy in our countries is very good news but, as you know, combined with the dramatic decline of birth rates after the baby boom in the 1950s and the 1960s it implies that populations in a large number of countries are ageing rapidly.", "Ultimately, the elderly dependency ratio will rise gradually but substantially.", "To put it more clearly: our children will have to cater for a growing number of pensioners.", "Even if ageing pressures will in most cases only culminate from the second decade of the current century onwards - when the baby boom generation starts to retire from the labour market - the economics profession has a long-standing interest in population ageing.", "As early as the 1980s, individual authors or international bodies singled out ageing as one of the biggest economic challenges of the future.", "The first task at hand for economic researchers was obviously to estimate the size of the problem: what is it that we are facing?", "Most studies initially focused on the pensions problem and the budgetary impact of ageing.", "Two remarks in that respect.", "- Subsequent studies revealed that, contrary to what is still often thought, pension expenditure is not the only budgetary item that will soar because of population ageing.", "The ageing problem is as much a health care problem, for instance, as it is a pension problem.", "On the other hand, one should not forget that ageing will have a beneficial effect on other spending categories like child allowances and education expenditure.", "Hence, the net budgetary cost of ageing can be somewhat lower than the projected increase in pension and health care spending.", "All in all, even taking into account the large degree of uncertainty inherent in this kind of exercise, ageing will undoubtedly weigh substantially on future governments' budgets.", "- One should refrain, however, from simplifying a problem as complex as population ageing into a kind of bill for the governments to pay.", "Ageing will have a substantial impact on a wide range of economic variables -without speaking of other serious aspects of the social life-, from activity growth to unemployment, from national saving to the composition of private consumption and -yes, I am a central banker- from asset prices to inflation.", "Hence, it goes without saying that ageing requires a holistic approach on our behalf.", "From the very beginning central bankers have always been keen observers of, if not active contributors to the research on ageing.", "Any shock that has a sizeable impact on the macroeconomic environment should be taken into account when setting monetary policy and, as we have seen, the potential consequences of population ageing, for the government accounts, for instance, can hardly be underestimated.", "Considering the impact that the combination, in a number of European countries, of sizeable tax cuts and an, altogether, limited slump in activity growth currently has on public finances, it is quite unsettling to imagine what kind of havoc can be wreaked in government budgets by inappropriate policy responses to population ageing.", "If what we are currently witnessing is the budgetary fall out of a mild economic storm, then, surely, the ageing problem should be compared to a genuine earthquake.", "All in all, it is a problem that can only be countered by a well-balanced and consistent strategy that should be put into action as soon and as determinedly as possible.", "The lines along which action should be taken have been clearly identified.", "First, governments should get their fiscal houses in order before ageing really starts to kick in; excessive deficits should be avoided and countries that still face a high public debt ought to continue and, if necessary, intensify debt reduction.", "Second, economic policy has to be geared towards increasing productivity growth and the employment rate - especially of older workers - so as to broaden the tax base as much as possible.", "Third, the buoyant growth of health care spending needs to be analysed and the individual pension entitlements, both in the private and in the public sector, need to be thoroughly assessed taking into account also the development of second- and third-pillar schemes.", "In addition, governments of some countries should consider in what way the latter schemes can be encouraged further, either by tax abatement or by regulation.", "Considering present market returns, it's probably needless to add, however, that second and third pillars based on capitalisation in the stock market, can not by themselves provide a miracle solution, contrary to what some people advocated previously.", "Any viable solution to the ageing crisis is bound to be a blend of those three ingredients: it would be very easy, for instance, to offset the upward pressure on government spending coming from the rising number of elderly by simply reducing the average pension to a basic-needs level and to turn the health care system into a two-tier one, where public insurance is very limited and only the richest part of the population has access to new technologies via private schemes, but that would simply amount to a hollowing out of the welfare state, which our fellow citizens and myself do not wish.", "Taking stock of the policy response to the ongoing research on ageing, I guess it is fair to say that the results so far have been mixed."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "none", "none", "monetary dominance", "monetary dominance", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "monetary-fiscal coordination", "none", "none", "none", "none"], "topics": ["Population Ageing", "Pensions", "Health Care", "Government Budgets", "Economic Growth", "Employment", "Productivity", "Fiscal Policy", "Welfare State", "Retirement"]}
