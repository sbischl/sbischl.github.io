trends in EU countries such as Germany, France and the Benelux countries usually were broadly similar, economic developments in Finland diverged a lot.", "There were differences in the both the timing of the fluctuations and the amplitude of the fluctuations, which was much greater in Finland than elsewhere.", "As the single monetary policy was to be tuned according to the economic situation of the whole euro area, it was feared that the single monetary policy could be inappropriate or even grossly inappropriate for the Finnish economy.", "The following reasons were put forward for the asymmetry

introduction of the euro might not necessarily be fun, but it would not be painful either.", "The key to survival or even success was to know the facts.", "Thirdly, keeping the campaigns small and simple meant there was a lot of room for manoeuvre up to the last minute.", "For example the Bank of Finland received continuous feedback from the public via telephone and adjusted the main focus accordingly.", "Therefore we were able to address even the most recent questions posed by the public.", "Lessons from the campaigns It is our experience that the general public is more prone to learn from a campaign, if information is presented with familiar words and in a familiar environment, even with some nostalgia.", "All efforts must be carefully coordinated and adjusted.", "Even if there are several campaigns, they must communicate with a single voice.", "Last but not least, the authorities need partners from the private sector.", "Cash handlers in Finland were trained by the partners

leaflets, posters, videos etc.", "were delivered exactly to those who most needed them.", "Of course we must remember that different nationalities prefer different information channels.", "For

effective.", "According to our survey, the readership level of the brochure we had delivered to every household was an impressive 80%.", "Changeover - a success story in Finland and all euro area

is a major concern for the countries currently planning the introduction of the euro.", "What about Finland, did prices actually rise in our country?", "Statistics show that there was no notable change in Finnish inflation with the changeover to euro cash.", "In fact, the rate of increase in consumer prices in 2002 was slightly lower than in 2001.", "While it is true that many product prices were rounded upward at the time of the changeover, the impact on overall inflation was modest and short-lived.", "Statistics Finland estimated the changeover effect on Finnish inflation in January 2002 as small and noticeable mainly in a few services.", "According to Eurostat, the price-rise effect of the changeover for the whole euro area in 2002 was about 0.1-0.3 percentage points.", "Consumers' perceived inflation and CPI inflation in Finland However, survey results suggest that the consumers' perceived inflation has been considerably higher after the introduction of the Euro.", "There are similar differences between perceived and actual inflation in many other countries that moved to the Euro.", "In a recent report by the Bank of Finland, several possibilities for explanations are proposed for the gap between real and perceived inflation.", "Firstly, it seems that consumers form their price perception on the basis of much smaller composites of goods and services than those included in the consumer price index.", "Secondly, the changeover to euro cash has obscured the comparison of prices, and consumers are now apparently less precise when they follow price developments than before.", "Sellers' pricing practices have also changed: 'psychological prices', eg those ending in the digits 5-9, now account for a smaller portion of nominal prices as a result of the euro-cash changeover.", "Finally, the fact that consumers have generally used an even six and not the exact figure (5.95) as the euro-to-markka conversion coefficient has resulted in a slight (0.9%) overestimation of prices.", "The Finnish Consumer Research Centre has also studied the price awareness of the public.", "The results indicate that consumers' price awareness has diminished with the changeover.", "Perhaps the most surprising was that price awareness had not essentially improved by 2005, more than three years after the cash changeover.", "Finland's experience of the monetary union: evidence and conclusions We now have almost eight years' experience of the monetary union.", "Interestingly, many of the asymmetric shocks feared by the opponents to Finland's adoption of the euro have already been realised over this relatively short period.", "The telecom industry, which is important for Finland's economy, experienced a strong boom-bust cycle around the turn of the century, and the exchange rate of the euro vis-a\u0300-vis the dollar, which is important for Finland's exports, first depreciated nearly 30% and then appreciated 50%.", "Moreover, the price of oil has multiplied during the existence of the euro.", "However, contrary to the opponents' expectations, neither the positive external shock experienced at the turn of the century nor the increase in the price of oil served to push Finland's economy into an inflationary spiral, and the Finnish economy was also able to weather the recession of the telecom industry and the appreciation of the euro rather painlessly.", "Eight years is too short a period for a definitive assessment of the pros and cons of a monetary union, but let me draw some tentative conclusions from our experiences thus far.", "In spite of these asymmetric shocks, it can be said that the single monetary policy has suited Finland's economy rather well.", "This is indicated among other things by the fact that, except for the initial period, Finland's inflation has remained for the most time within the range of the ECB's definition for price stability and in fact in recent years has been among the lowest ones in the EU.", "At the same time employment and output have grown well in comparison to most of the other euro area countries.", "On top of which, the profitability of Finland's industry has been at a good level.", "Our experience seems to indicate that even in a small and 'asymmetric' country the ECB's credible monetary policy and stability orientation can offer a large majority of the citizens and enterprises a sound monetary environment."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
