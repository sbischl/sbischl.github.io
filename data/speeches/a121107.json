system where markets and institutions are more transparent, less complex, and less leveraged than they are today.", "While the banking sector in ASEAN has not reached the degree of complexity observed in the advanced economies, the region has to be mindful of the consequences as financial institutions evolve to become increasingly regional in orientation.", "Indeed, such growth must be commensurate with the capacity and capability of both the financial institutions and the regulators to manage and oversee the associated risks.", "Strengthened supervisory intensity and effectiveness, a core component of the financial sector reforms, is an essential pillar to check against unfettered innovation and risk-taking behaviours and promote strong incentives for prudent risk management.", "ASEAN will have to pursue an outcome that facilitates innovation and efficiency, without resulting in undue risks and unwanted costs on both the financial system and the overall economy.", "Second, is the stronger focus on more responsible and sustainable financial business practices.", "Following the recent global financial crisis, there is a stronger international emphasis for appropriate risk-aligned mechanisms, particularly on compensation frameworks, which provide incentives for financial innovation and growth, while not compromising financial stability.", "This includes the increased pressure on financial institutions and regulators to have incentive systems, governance, accountability and controls to address the issues of over-emphasis on short term performance, reckless risk-taking and the pervasive conflict of interests.", "In tandem with this, is the stronger focus to spur consumer activism as a means to encourage more responsible and sustainable business practices.", "It is in this area that financial institutions can have an important role in creating positive conduct and behaviours among financial participants in the industry, as well as

expectations on the management, boards of financial institutions and on regulators to significantly improve governance practices, particularly in the area of risk management policies and procedures.", "At the international level, substantial enhancements have been made to standards on corporate governance.", "The growing expansion of ASEAN banks in the region, must therefore be accompanied by an increased emphasis for the boards and senior management of financial institutions to provide the leadership and oversight of group-wide risks arising from cross-border operations.", "Greater diversity of boards to appreciate cultural nuances and competitive dynamics in different markets will hence be key to support sustainable cross-border operations of the institutions.", "Fourthly, is reinforcing buffers to withstand future shocks.", "This is a key area of the international reform package that aims to significantly raise the resilience of the international financial system and to promote sound risk-taking activities.", "The standards will see financial institutions holding larger amounts of capital, including buffers which can be drawn down as losses occur.", "At the same time, the standards will also require banking institutions to significantly strengthen their liquidity and funding positions.", "Collectively, these standards aim to strengthen the banking institutions' ability to continue to support orderly credit intermediation, particularly during periods of instability.", "While carrying more equity entails greater costs of capital for banks especially in the short-term, this investment will support a more stable financial system and overall global economy as well as build the confidence of consumers and investors, particularly during periods of stress.", "In view of these imperatives, this is a timely juncture for the industry to reflect and take charge of the efforts to rebuild and strengthen the foundations for more sustainable finance.", "Critical to this is the realisation that the creation of long-term shareholder value is consistent with, and not at odds with prudent risk taking and responsible business practices.", "Indeed, financial institutions with a regional footprint in ASEAN have the potential to contribute to the development of the financial systems in countries where they operate.", "There will be tremendous payoffs to be reaped from pursuing such sustainable strategies.", "Such long-term commitments to ASEAN will not only contribute to mutually reinforcing regional growth, but will become an important source of stability to the region.", "Let me now conclude my remarks.", "There is less than three years to achieving the 2015 ASEAN aspirations.", "While many challenges remain, ASEAN is well positioned to collectively strive ahead towards the shared vision of a one ASEAN market.", "The financial industry has an important role in realising this vision, through its market conduct, business strategies and participation in domestic and regional collaborative initiatives.", "This conference provides an excellent strategic platform for the ASEAN industry to come together, share ideas and develop a greater understanding on the important issues towards building a stronger foundation for sustainable growth in ASEAN.", "On that note, I wish you an engaging and productive conference."], "classifications": ["none", "none",
