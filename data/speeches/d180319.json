it[RBI] has also limited legal authority to hold PSB Boards accountable regarding strategic direction, risk profiles, assessment of management, and compensation.", "Legal reforms are thus highly desirable to empower the RBI to fully exercise the same responsibilities for PSBs as now apply to private banks, and to ensure a level playing field in supervisory enforcement.", "Specifically, on Corporate Governance (CP 14, Para 50, page 18): The appropriate rules on fitness and propriety, and banks' internal governance structures, are in place with respect to private and foreign banks.", "Nevertheless, the influence the RBI may exercise on banks' governance through section 21 BR Act, placement of RBI representatives on banks' Boards, and the RBI's very limited authority under the Banking Acts, as well as the custom to hold the PSB Boards accountable has become problematic.", "Under the law and according to custom, the RBI cannot hold PSB Boards accountable for assessing and- when necessary- replacing weak and nonperforming senior management and government-appointed Board members.", "Banking regulatory powers in India are NOT ownership neutral All commercial banks in India are regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act of 1949.", "Additionally, all public sector banks are regulated by the Government of India (GoI) under the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970;

in particular, regarding Board member dismissals, mergers, and license revocation... Having said that, banks' operational risk management, risk culture, internal control frameworks and external audit function should typically play a central role in preventing fraud.\"", "Need to refocus on the bigger issue of stressed assets resolution Let me now turn to an issue of greater magnitude and more significance than the most recent banking fraud.", "Its magnitude is larger than 8 1/2 lakh crores of stressed assets on bank balancesheets and its significance stems from several practices in promoter-bank credit relationship that need immediate attention.", "The RBI's Financial Stability Report of June 2017 (Section VII.", "Frauds, Para 3.36) clarifies that there is a link between bank frauds and this stressed assets problem: \"One of the emerging risk to the financial sector is increasing trends in frauds in commercial banks and financial institutions.", "During the last five financial years, frauds have increased substantially both in volume and value terms.", "During this period, while the volume of frauds has increased by 19.6 per cent from 4235 to 5064, the value (loss incurred) has increased by 72 per cent from Rs.", "Share of frauds in [loan] advances portfolio continued to be high at 86 per cent of the frauds reported during 2016-17 (in terms of amount involved)...In a number of large value frauds, serious gaps in credit underwriting standards were evident.", "Some of the often seen gaps are liberal cash flow projection at the proposal stage, lack of continuous monitoring of cash flows and cash profits (EBITDA), lack of security perfection and over valuation, gold plating of projects, diversion of funds, double financing and general credit governance issues in banks.", "Moreover, almost all corporate loan related fraud cases get seasoned for 2 to 3 years as NPAs before they are reported as fraud.\"", "The broad conclusion that has been universally reached is that enterprises in India have over and over again received excessive credit during loan growth cycles, which is followed soon after with repayment problems.", "Rather than resolving stressed credit problems swiftly, banks-either through loan-level \"fudges\" or refusal to recognise the true asset quality of the credits - have allowed promoters in charge of enterprises to have a soft landing.", "This soft landing has comprised of even more bank lending so as to keep the accounts artificially in full repayment on past dues, protracted control for promoters over failed assets, and effectively granting them the ability to divert cash and assets, often outside of our jurisdictional reach.", "The RBI has been clamping down on the failure to recognise asset quality as non-performing as per its norms by requiring that banks, whose \"divergence\" exceeds by 15% of the true nonperforming assets as per the norms, disclose the divergence.", "This should restore some market discipline against such practices, especially in the case of private sector banks.", "However, ultimately there also needs to be a framework in place for time-bound resolution of the underlying stress in assets that limits the discretion of banks to delay the recognition of stress, ever-green \"zombie\" or living-dead borrowers, and poorly allocate credit.", "To this end, I wish to present and clarify the rationale behind RBI's revised framework for prompt recognition and resolution of stressed assets.", "The framework that was released last month remains somewhat under-appreciated in terms of its importance.", "So let me lay it out.", "Prompt recognition and resolution of stressed assets - revised framework 1.", "The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2017, and the subsequent authorisation given by the Government of India therein, has empowered the Reserve Bank to issue directions to the banks for resolution of stressed assets, including referring assets to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC).", "The Reserve Bank has taken steps over the last year in this direction, with a focus on reference to the IBC of certain large value stressed accounts, covering approximately 40% of banking sector's overall exposure to the stressed assets.", "The revised framework for resolution of stressed assets released by the Reserve Bank on February 12, 2018 is a step towards taking these initial steps to their natural conclusion and laying down a steady-state approach.", "The steady-state approach is aimed at ensuring early resolution of stressed assets in a transparent and time-bound manner so that maximum value could be realised by the lenders while also recognising the potential ongoing concern value of stressed assets.", "As explained below, this approach is a positive step towards strengthening the credit culture in the economy, at both borrowers and banks.", "Various special schemes for resolution, which were introduced by the RBI in the pre-IBC context, had made the resolution process driven by asset-classification consideration of lenders.", "In particular, the forbearance that was embedded in the schemes to make it easier for banks to resolve assets became an end in itself with little resolution achieved through deployment of the schemes.", "The revised framework substitutes for these pre-IBC schemes and does away with forbearance since it delayed resolution.", "The framework relies instead on the biggest structural reform in the credit system in the country in several decades, viz., the IBC, as an important part of resolution.", "By employing the IBC as its lynchpin, the framework is intended rightly to ensure that the resolution plan for stressed assets is dictated also, and in fact, primarily, by asset viability considerations.", "It must be stressed that the revised framework would allow lenders absolute flexibility to put in place any credible resolution plan, as under the pre-IBC schemes, subject to meeting certain implementation conditions (the conditions being necessary to alleviate concerns relating to ever-greening of unviable assets).", "In particular, in respect of accounts with aggregate exposure greater than Rs.", "2,000 crores, the resolution plan would be required to be implemented within 180 days from the date of default, failing which these would be referred under the IBC.", "This threshold would be brought down only gradually over a period of two years to enable the IBC infrastructure to install in parallel the required capacity to handle more cases.", "It must be emphasised that IBC itself is a resolution framework, whereby such accounts will have sufficient time (180 days from the date of default plus up to 270 days under the IBC) for effective resolution.", "It must also be underscored that under the revised framework: Change of ownership is being favoured even prior to the IBC reference as it leads to asset being classified as standard (as under the earlier schemes).", "The defaulting promoters also risk losing control of the firm under the IBC bidding.", "Hence, the revised framework will engender incentives for borrowers to not over-borrow and instead to manage better the various business risks that might lead to default.", "There will also be greater incentive for lenders to implement an efficient turnaround plan to get a quicker upgrade in case of restructuring.", "Further since there is no forbearance for assets classified as NPAs, the revised framework will encourage banks to reduce slippages to NPAs through early recognition of stress and timely action, possibly even before a borrower gets into financial difficulty.", "In other words, the IBC along with RBI's revised framework will help break the promoterbank nexus which has led to crony capitalism and attendant NPA/credit misallocation problem as ever-greening suited some borrowers and some lenders under the earlier framework.", "In turn, this will prevent the erosion of growth from the emergence of zombie 1.", "Finally, the revised framework specifically excludes the revival and rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with exposures of up to Rs.", "25 crore, which shall continue to be covered under the earlier norms.", "We believe this is precisely the fundamental reform needed in order to strengthen the credit culture at origination, default, asset quality recognition and resolution stages.", "By so doing, it should weaken in the first place opportunities for engaging in frauds relating to loan advances.", "Let me now make some Concluding remarks.", "I have chosen to speak today to convey that we at the Reserve Bank of India also feel the anger, hurt and pain at the banking sector frauds and irregularities.", "In plain simple English, these practices amount to a looting of our country's future by some in the business community, in cahoots with some lenders.", "As safeguards of your deposits at banks, and starting with the Asset Quality Review of banks announced by the Reserve Bank in 2015 - since ably conducted by our supervisory teams and as acknowledged objectively by experts of reputed multilateral agencies, we are doing all we can to break this unholy nexus.", "I see what we have undertaken for cleaning up the credit culture of the country - in particular, the comprehensive regulatory overhaul announced by the Reserve Bank on February 12th for prompt recognition and resolution of NPAs at banks - as the Mandara mount or the churning rod in the Amrit Manthan or the Samudra Manthan of the modern day Indian economy.", "Until the churn is complete and the nectar of stability safely secured for the country's future, someone must consume the poison that emanates along the way.", "If we need to face the brickbats and be the Neelakantha consuming this poison, we will do so as our duty; we will persist with our endeavours and get better with each trial and tribulation along the way.", "I do wish more promoters and banks, individually - or collectively through their industry bodies, would reconsider being on the side of Devas rather than Asuras in this Amrit Manthan.", "The owner of our public sector banks - the government -which has provided the IBC, the related ordinances and the bank recapitalisation package to get the churn going, might consider making further, equally important contributions by: 1.", "Making banking regulatory powers neutral to bank ownership and leveling the playing field between public sector and private sector banks; and, 2.", "Informing itself about what do with the public sector banking system going forward as part of optimising over the best use of scarce national fiscal resources.", "It is an open issue whether centralised government control alone can be effective enough at designing and implementing governance of banking franchise comprising over 2/3rds of the sector's deposits and assets.", "It would be better instead to restore regulatory and market discipline.", "These, and other structural reforms to the banking sector, would enable India to grow sustainably at respectable rates.", "It is to be noted here that the FSAP also mentions in Other Regulation, Accounting, and Disclosure (CPs 20, 26- 29, Para 62, page 21): Currently, the external auditor is not obliged to report immediately to the RBI regulator any issues encountered in the audited bank that are of material interest to the supervisor.", "This is only permitted after publication of the annual statements.", "Moreover, regulators need powers to access the auditor's working papers when needed.", "This is currently not envisaged.", "The laws and/or regulations should explicitly authorise the external auditor to inform the RBI of any concerns at any time; also, before the annual statements have been finalised and published.", "The RBI should be given the explicit authority to obtain information at any time from the external auditor.", "This point, however, applies both for public and private sector banks.", "The exception to this is IDBI Bank Ltd., for which the Articles of Association (Clause 120) grant the RBI the requisite authority.", "Of course, there are several other (well documented) implications of being public sector banks: board constitution, wherein it is difficult to categorise any director as independent; significant and widening compensation differences with private sector banks, leading to the erosion of specialist skills; external vigilance enforcement though the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI); and limited applicability of the Right To Information (RTI) Act.", "The duality of banking regulatory powers exists even in the case of co-operative banks where the RBI has to contend with several powers being vested away from it in hands of state governments.", "Co-operative banks are typically small and their failures are dealt adequately with through liquidation by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) which insures some of their depositors.", "This duality also needs to be addressed as part of the broader banking sector reforms to improve credit culture and reduce fraudulent lending."], "classifications": ["none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none", "none",
