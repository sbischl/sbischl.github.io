it must be estimated.", "There is considerable uncertainty, both theoretically and empirically, about the best way to estimate and forecast potential production.", "The output gap shown in the figures is the so-called HP gap, which has significant weaknesses.", "It is important and desirable from several points of view that the Riksbank and other central banks develop better and clearer measures of resource utilisation and potential production and that they publish their measurements and forecasts.", "Such work is underway at the Riksbank.", "Assuming, however, that we nevertheless conclude that monetary policy has not been clearly inefficient in the sense that I described earlier, the next step is to focus on what combination of the stabilisation of inflation and the real economy the central bank actually selected or, in other words, which of all the possible points on the Taylor curve the central bank selected.", "There are many different efficient monetary policy alternatives to choose between every time a monetary policy decision is made.", "But did the central bank make a good choice?", "In the event of a conflict between stabilising inflation and stabilising the real economy, did the combination chosen by the central bank represent a reasonable balance between the two?", "Did the central bank attach reasonable importance to the stabilisation of the real economy in relation to the stabilisation of inflation?", "In the literature, as in the case of the forecast loss function I presented earlier, the constant that is the relative weight that the central bank gives to the stabilisation of the real economy in relation to the stabilisation of inflation is usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda, \u03bb.", "In Figure 3, we can show the forecast loss function with the help of iso-loss curves for combinations of sums of squared inflation-gap and output-gap forecasts that generate equally large losses.", "Such iso-loss curves are in this case downward-sloping, straight lines with a slope of 1/\u03bb, the reciprocal of lambda.", "Iso-loss lines closer to origin correspond to lower losses.", "The ideal, but normally unattainable, situation would be an iso-loss line at the origin, which represents a loss of zero and means that the forecast for inflation is exactly on target and that the forecast for resource utilisation is exactly equal to the normal level.", "However, the modified Taylor curve shows the minimum sums of squares that are possible on each decision-making occasion.", "The best monetary policy therefore entails selecting a point on the Taylor curve so that the iso-loss line for the loss function is as close to origin as possible.", "This is the point at which the iso-loss line is a tangent to the Taylor curve.", "Figure 3 shows an iso-loss line that is a tangent to the Taylor curve at point B.", "For the given lambda, which determines the slope of the iso-loss lines, this point thus represents a well-balanced monetary policy.", "As I have emphasised, the position of the Taylor curve depends on the initial state of the economy at the time the decision is made.", "In a situation in which it is more difficult to stabilise resource utilisation, the Taylor curve will be closer to the vertical axis than to the horizontal axis, for example like the dashed curve above point A.", "The point of tangency for an iso-loss line with the same slope, which represents a well-balanced monetary policy, will then be at D. In a situation in which it is more difficult to stabilise inflation, the Taylor curve will instead be closer to the horizontal axis than to the vertical axis, for example like the dashed curve to the right of point C. The point of tangency for an iso-loss line with the same slope will then be at E. A central bank that has a low numerical value for lambda, that is a lower weight placed on the stability of the real economy, has steeper iso-loss lines.", "For a central bank with such a lambda, the point of contact with a given Taylor curve for a given decision-making situation will be higher up to the left in the figure, for example at point A, where the Taylor curve is steeper.", "The inflation forecast will then be closer to the target, but the forecast for resource utilisation will deviate more from the normal level.", "A central bank with a high numerical value for lambda, that is a high weight placed on the stability of the real economy, has iso-loss lines that are flatter.", "In the case of such a lambda, the point of contact will be lower down to the left, for example at point C, where the Taylor curve is flatter.", "The inflation forecast will then be further from the target while the forecast for resource utilisation will be closer to a normal level.", "It is of course not so easy to determine what a reasonably large lambda should be for a central bank.", "Neither the Riksbank nor other central banks have yet announced whether they apply a specific lambda and if so what this lambda is.", "In those cases where the decisions are made by a committee made up of several members, as at the Riksbank, it is also possible that different members attach different degrees of importance to the stability of the real economy.", "A question that then arises is how these different views should be aggregated.", "Nor is it entirely certain that monetary policy decision-makers are even clearly aware of the importance they attach to stability compared with the stability of inflation.", "If the central bank's forecasts are only based on a known model, like the Riksbank's main model Ramses, it is possible to determine the position of the modified Taylor curve and which point the Riksbank's main scenario in each Monetary Policy report corresponds to.", "In practice, the Riksbank's forecasts and those of other central banks are based on several different models and a great deal of judgement.", "This means that it is not quite as easy to determine the position of the modified Taylor curve.", "It is still possible, however, to enter the position of various forecast alternatives on the graph and at least assess whether the forecast is extreme in any respect with regard to the deviation of inflation from the target and the deviation of resource utilisation from the normal level.", "As yet, it is in practice mainly a question of whether the choice of interest rate path was extreme in either direction in the sense that the central bank gave considerable or very little relative weight to the stability of the real economy.", "Another interesting aspect to investigate is whether the weight attached to the stability of the real economy actually has been constant over time.", "If it has not been constant then the central bank's loss function has not been consistent over time, or it is more complicated than the quadratic loss function that I have discussed here and that is regarded as normal and reasonable in the literature on monetary policy.", "Figures 4 and 6 can be studied more closely in the light of this discussion.", "In Figure 4 we can see that the main scenario for February 2008 leads to resource utilisation being stabilised rather well, but that the CPI forecast is a little high in relation to the target of 2 per cent.", "In Figure 6, we can also see that the sum of squares for the output-gap forecast is much smaller than for the inflation-gap forecast.", "A higher repo rate path should have been able to push down both the inflation forecast and the forecast for resource utilisation.", "This would have reduced the sum of squares for the inflation-gap forecast but not increased the sum of squares for the output-gap forecast by very much.", "This would move the point for February 2008 in Figure 6 to the left and somewhat upwards.", "Unless the iso-loss line for the forecast loss function is very flat, that is unless the weight given to the stabilisation of resource utilisation is very high, this should give rise to a lower loss and thus to a more well-balanced monetary policy.", "The main scenario in February 2008 would thus be an example of a monetary policy that was not well balanced.", "However, in February 2008 the Riksbank attached more importance to the CPIX forecast than to the CPI forecast.", "The CPIX forecast gives rise to much smaller deviations from the target than the CPI forecast; see Figure 7.", "With regard to the CPIX forecast, monetary policy in February 2008 was better balanced.", "Figures 8 and 9 show the Riksbank's forecasts for inflation and the output gap since the beginning of 2007 and the sum of squares for the inflation-gap and output-gap forecasts.", "It is apparent that the initial situation for the forecasts can be very different.", "If, for example, we compare the forecast in February 2007 with the latest forecast from February 2009, it is obvious that it was much easier to make the earlier forecast \"look good\".", "The forecast at that time indicated that the deviations for the inflation target and the output gap were small - the sums of squares were close to origin.", "This can be contrasted to the situation in early 2009 when the fluctuations in both of the forecasts were considerable and the sums of squares were far up to the right in the figure.", "Finally, before I move on to discuss the evaluation of monetary policy after the event, I would like to say that ex ante evaluations have the major advantage that they can be carried out on an ongoing basis in real time and that you do not need to wait several years to see the outcomes for inflation and the real economy.", "I would like to see competent ex ante evaluations become a lasting feature of the ongoing public debate on monetary policy so that they could constantly encourage the central banks to improve their analyses and their policies.", "Evaluation ex post - after the event The most relevant starting point for an evaluation of monetary policy is, as I said earlier, the information and data that was available when the monetary policy decisions were made.", "That is an ex ante evaluation.", "However, an ex post analysis may also be relevant.", "The forecast evaluation that I discussed earlier was, for example, ex post.", "But an evaluation of monetary policy after the event can also provide valuable insights regarding the monetary policy conducted.", "The question we should then ask is: given what we know today, what form would a better monetary policy have taken?", "Would it have been possible with a different monetary policy to achieve a better stabilisation of resource utilisation without undermining the stabilisation of inflation, or vice versa?", "As this is an analysis in which we know what actually happened and what the results were, it is rather likely that we will discover that this would in fact have been possible.", "We would then have to get to the bottom of why such a monetary policy was not chosen.", "Could any of the outcomes have been predicted ex ante?", "Anyone may of course have luck with a single forecast.", "But was there another analyst who in a convincing way actually predicted the shocks to the economy that occurred and that the central bank missed?", "A large part of this analysis will thus concern evaluating and explaining forecast errors - even individual errors - and deviations from the central bank's targets.", "It is actually fairer to focus on forecast errors as deviations from targets under a flexible inflation targeting regime may be deliberate on the part of the central bank.", "Evaluating the central bank's forecasts is thus important; that is investigating whether the forecasts systematically over- or underestimate outcomes and so on.", "It is also interesting to compare forecast errors for inflation, for the real economy - irrespective of the measure of resource utilisation used - and for the interest rate if the central bank publishes such a forecast.", "Which forecast errors are most relevant for explaining why monetary policy, with the benefit of hindsight, could have been better?", "What were these forecast errors due to?", "A disadvantage of an ex post evaluation is that we have to wait at least a couple of years for the outcomes for inflation and the real economy for the full impact of the monetary policy measures to become apparent.", "As I emphasised earlier, an ex ante evaluation can on the other hand be performed in real time as a part of the ongoing public debate on monetary policy.", "The credibility of monetary policy is always an important factor.", "The credibility of an inflation targeting regime is usually measured by to what extent inflation expectations for different time horizons correspond to the inflation target.", "The greater the degree of correspondence, the higher the degree of credibility.", "This provides a direct indication of the level of confidence in the ability of the central bank to meet the inflation target.", "Figure 10 shows how inflation expectations among money market agents developed in 2008 and early 2009.", "It is evident that expectations for both one and two years ahead have been revised significantly downwards recently, which is hardly surprising given the development of the economy.", "In the longer term, however, the expectations are well anchored around the target.", "How well inflation expectations are anchored around the target also has a direct impact on how well the central bank succeeds in meeting the target and on the possibilities the central bank has to also stabilise the real economy.", "This is because inflation expectations directly affect price and wage setting in the economy.", "Stable inflation expectations eliminate a potential source of shocks and make it easier for the central bank to stabilise both inflation and the real economy.", "More stable inflation expectations shift the Taylor curve in Figure 3 closer to origin and make the balance between the stability of inflation and the stability of the real economy more favourable.", "As the central bank's inflation forecasts in the short and medium terms may deliberately deviate from the target, it is also interesting to compare inflation expectations with the central bank's inflation forecasts.", "If the economic agents share the central bank's view of how inflation will approach the target, inflation expectations at different time horizons should be close to the central bank's forecasts.", "The degree of correspondence between inflation expectations and the central bank's inflation forecasts then becomes a measure of how credible the central bank's inflation forecasts and analyses are.", "Such a correspondence between expectations and forecasts is of course also desirable for forecasts for the real economy and, not least, for forecasts for the policy rate, which I will now discuss.", "Was the implementation of monetary policy effective?", "I have spoken earlier about what characterises efficient monetary policy decisions.", "This was in relation to the balance between stabilising inflation and stabilising the real economy given the information available at the time of the decision.", "Another important aspect is to investigate how effective the implementation of monetary policy has been, in the sense of affecting the economy in the desired direction and to the right amount.", "An effective implementation of monetary policy presupposes that there is a high level of private-sector confidence in the central bank with regard to both the inflation target and the monetary policy analysis.", "It also requires that the central bank is successful in communicating its analysis and intentions.", "In other words, a precondition for an effective monetary policy implementation is that the central bank is open and transparent.", "Most central banks use a short-term interest rate as the policy rate to implement monetary policy.", "However, the actual policy rate in the two months prior to the next monetary policy decision plays a very minor role in the economy.", "Expectations regarding future policy rates, on the other hand, do play an important role.", "They affect interest rates with longer maturities which in turn are the interest rates that have an impact on the economic decisions of households and companies.", "The Riksbank and a few other central banks have taken this seriously and publish their own policy rate paths to facilitate the formation of expectations regarding future policy rates and to influence these expectations more effectively.", "If the central bank is successful in its communication, the market participants should be able to predict rather well how new information or new shocks will affect the central bank's forecast for the policy rate.", "If the central bank's analysis is credible, the market's expectations regarding the future policy rate should also change in line with the revised interest rate path of the central bank.", "One way of evaluating how effectively the central bank implements monetary policy is therefore to simply investigate how well the market participants have predicted the changes in the central bank's interest rate path.", "We can also analyse how well the expectations regarding the future interest rate adapt to the central bank's new interest rate path after the announcement.", "Figures 11 and 12 are examples of the type of figure that can be studied in this case.", "These relate to the first interest rate decision I was involved in making, in June 2007, and to the latest decision from February this year.", "Let me now sum up by first returning to the question I raised at the start: when evaluating monetary policy with an inflation target, why is it not enough to simply compare outcomes and targets for inflation?", "One reason is that inflation reacts with varying time lags and to different degrees to monetary policy measures.", "Inflation is also affected by shocks that are difficult to identify or that occur at a later date.", "The central bank does not therefore have complete control over inflation.", "Inflation can be on target even if the central bank has acted wrongly but been lucky, or deviate from the target even if the central bank has acted correctly but been unlucky.", "Another reason is that the Riksbank and other central banks with inflation targets conduct flexible inflation targeting, which means that they strive to both stabilise inflation around the inflation target and to stabilise the real economy.", "Inflation may then deliberately deviate from the target if this provides a better balance between stable inflation and a stable real economy.", "As there is a significant time lag before monetary policy measures have an impact on inflation and the real economy, monetary policy is best when it is based on forecasts.", "With a flexible inflation targeting regime, it is thus a question of choosing a repo rate path so that the forecast for inflation and the real economy stabilises inflation and the real economy as effectively as possible.", "It is thus possible and desirable to evaluate monetary policy ex ante and in real time by assessing to what extent the central bank's forecasts optimally stabilise both inflation and the real economy.", "However, before we do this it is necessary to assess whether the central bank's previous forecasts have been reasonably accurate and of good quality, for example in comparison with those of other forecasters.", "It is also of interest to evaluate monetary policy ex post, that is, after the event.", "As target deviations and forecast deviations are unavoidable due to the great degree of uncertainty about the future development of the economy and the delayed impact of monetary policy measures, an ex post evaluation is mainly a question of whether it would have been possible to predict the shocks and deviations that occurred, particularly if other analysts have systematically been able to predict them.", "It is also of interest to measure the credibility of monetary policy in terms of how well inflation expectations correspond to the inflation target.", "The degree of correspondence between expectations and the central bank's forecasts for inflation and the real economy is also a measure of the credibility of the central bank's analyses and forecasts.", "As monetary policy is mainly about managing expectations, particularly expectations concerning future policy rates, it is of great interest to see to what extent a published repo rate path has been predicted by the market and other analysts.", "It is also interesting to know to what extent market expectations are adapted to the new repo rate path.", "This can be seen as a measure of how effectively the central bank implements monetary policy.", "I am grateful to Bjo\u0308rn Andersson, Mikael Apel, Paolo Giordani, Gabriela Guibourg,
