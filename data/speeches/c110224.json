a mysterious institution?", "As I was preparing for this talk, it struck me that most people, even educated people, do not know very much about what the Reserve Bank does and why what it does is important.", "Many people think of the Reserve Bank as a mysterious institution, a sort of monolith - doing obscure things that have no real relevance for the everyday lives of people.", "Others think that all that the Reserve Bank does is print currency, and wonder why, when short of resources, we don't just print more of the stuff.", "Some people think that all that the Governor does every day in office is sign currency notes, and that if there is shortage of currency, it is because he is slow in signing.", "The reality is quite different.", "We print and distribute currency, of course, but we do a lot of other things besides.", "We are the monetary authority of the country.", "We are the gatekeepers of the external sector.", "We regulate and supervise banks, non-bank finance companies and segments of the financial markets to ensure that the money you keep in banks is safe and is productively deployed towards generating economic activity.", "Our regulation extends also to the payment and settlement systems with the aim of making financial transactions safe, robust and efficient.", "The Reserve Bank is also the central bank - that is it is the bank of banks and the bank of the Government of India as well as of state governments.", "On top of all this, and importantly, the Reserve Bank has a key role in the economic development of the country and drives an impressive social development agenda.", "That in a nutshell is the range and diversity of responsibilities of RBI.", "And what we do affects the everyday lives of people across the country from the prices they pay in the market, the interest they earn on their deposits in the bank, the interest that is charged when they borrow money and indeed how the government pays for new roads, schools and hospitals.", "In my remarks today, I will try and demystify the world of the Reserve Bank; I will explain some of its main responsibilities, share with you some of the policy challenges we face, and convey to you above all, how we try to make a difference.", "Production and distribution of currency Let me start with currency management - a function that most people are familiar with.", "An exclusive prerogative to issue currency has in fact become a defining characteristic of central banks.", "You must have noticed that the currency that you use has on it a promise by the Governor of the Reserve Bank that says that the note that you are carrying is worth what it says.", "Tautological as it might sound, this promise is significant because it enjoins on the Reserve Bank the responsibility of preserving the value of the rupee.", "An important issue we need to decide on is how much currency to print.", "We need to print enough currency to replace soiled and mutilated notes.", "On top of that we also need to print additional currency to meet the needs of economic growth.", "The currency expansion required to support growth depends on a number of variables including the growth rate, inflation rate, the growth elasticity of money and the velocity of money.", "This is a complex formula, but the important point to understand is that the amount of currency we need to print is determined by the replacement requirement and the economic growth requirement.", "As much as the amount of currency to be printed is formula driven in the first instance, the Reserve Bank cannot just \"issue\" currency.", "The currency we issue is a liability of the Reserve Bank.", "It has, therefore, to be backed by assets.", "Earlier on, the Reserve Bank too was part of the theology of the gold standard - the belief that issue of currency should be backed by the gold holdings of the central bank.", "In fact, the original Reserve Bank Act prescribed a proportional reserve system whereby of the total note issue, at least 40 per cent was to be backed by gold bullion and sterling.", "Like other central banks, we too have moved away from the gold standard, and today the asset backing for note issue comprises both domestic and foreign securities including gold held by the Reserve Bank.", "We have four presses where currency is printed.", "Two presses - one at Nasik in Maharashtra and the other at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh are under the control of the Government; the remaining two presses - at Mysore in Karnataka and at Salboni in West Bengal are under the control of the Reserve Bank.", "The currency printed at these four presses is distributed across the country through 20 of the Reserve Bank's regional offices and over 4200 currency chests located in commercial banks across the country.", "We are self-sufficient in printing capacity but we still import the paper required for printing currency.", "To remedy this, we are setting up a state of the art banknote paper mill in Mysore with a capacity 12000 MT per year which should cut our import demand by more than half.", "By far the most important facet of currency management is building in security features to prevent counterfeiting.", "People should be aware of these security features so that they can tell a forged note from a genuine one.", "This is the motivation for the awareness campaign that the Reserve Bank has launched in the print and electronic media to educate people on the security features.", "A dilemma we face here is that when we launch an awareness drive, we are willy-nilly providing information also to counterfeiters.", "We resolve this issue by making the replication of the security features technically complex and prohibitively expensive, and also by incorporating some additional security features that can be detected only by sophisticated gadgets and equipment.", "The Reserve Bank is also committed to a \"clean note\" policy.", "We exchange soiled notes for clean ones, and mutilated notes for new ones subject to certain conditions.", "In pursuit of our clean note policy and to check counterfeiting, we also prescribed that, by March 31, 2011, all bank branches with cash receipts of over 50 lakhs per day be equipped with a note sorting machine so that every high denomination currency note is checked for fitness and genuineness before being put back in circulation.", "Furthermore, we have instructed banks to ensure that the notes that they issue through their ATMs are also pre-checked for genuineness and cleanliness.", "Cost and longevity are important dimensions of currency management.", "We are a large cash economy; in fact, we are the second largest producer and consumer of currency in the world, next only to China.", "Producing such a large amount of currency is expensive.", "One option for economizing is replacing paper currency with plastic currency as some countries such as Singapore and Australia have already done.", "We are planning to try this out on a pilot basis starting with a plastic note in the 10 denomination, which we will distribute out of five of our regional offices in the country including our Bhubaneswar office.", "During the pilot phase, we need to study not only the relative costs but also the carbon footprint associated with the recycling and disposal of plastic notes vis-a\u0300-vis paper notes.", "If the pilot proves successful, we will mainstream the use of plastic currency.", "A quintessentially central banking function is the management of monetary policy.", "In formulating the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank is guided by three main objectives: maintain price stability, support economic growth by ensuring adequate flow of credit to productive sectors and preserve financial stability.", "Monetary policy is typically operated mainly through two variables - the price of money (policy interest rates) and the volume of money (liquidity).", "The Reserve Bank's monetary stance is defined by how we determine the price and volume of money.", "We decide on the price of money by prescribing the short term policy interest rates which define the upper and lower bands of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor.", "At the upper end is the repo rate - the rate of interest we charge banks for overnight borrowing from us, and at the lower end is the reverse repo rate - the interest rate we pay banks for their overnight deposits with us.", "By calibrating the overnight repo and reverse repo rates, we hope to influence the long term interest rates of the economy through a process called monetary transmission.", "The other variable - the volume of money - is controlled through mainly two instruments.", "The first is the cash reserve ratio (CRR), the proportion of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that banks are required to keep locked up with the Reserve Bank.", "The second is the OMO (open market operations) whereby the Reserve Bank buys and sells government securities in the open market in order to inject or withdraw money from the system.", "Another way in which money supply expands or contracts is through the Reserve Bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market.", "When the Reserve Bank buys (sells) foreign exchange, it releases (absorbs) an equivalent amount of liquidity into (from) the system.", "Having said that I must add that we do not intervene in the forex market for liquidity management purposes; we intervene only to contain volatility in the forex market, and any impact on liquidity is an incidental by product.", "Of course, price stability and macroeconomic stability do not necessarily guarantee financial stability.", "This is, in fact, one of the big lessons of the recent crisis.", "A post-crisis policy dilemma for central banks, and one that is dominating both academic and policy debates at the international level, is this: should financial stability be in the domain of monetary policy or should it be pursued as an objective of regulatory policy?", "In India though, we have never been doctrinaire about this.", "We have traditionally used regulatory tools such as risk weights and provisioning norms governing bank loans to aid monetary policy objectives.", "Indeed, one of the main reasons India came out of the crisis relatively unscathed is that the Reserve Bank \"leaned against the wind\" and took preemptive action to restrict the flow of credit to certain sectors such as real estate which showed signs of risk build-up.", "The Reserve Bank reviews its monetary policy stance every quarter through a scheduled policy review.", "This involves determining the relative prioritization between the three objectives of monetary policy - growth, price stability and financial stability - and on that basis, to determine whether and how our policy variables should be changed.", "Notwithstanding scheduled quarterly and mid-quarterly reviews, we reserve the right to alter our policy stance at any time to respond to the evolving macroeconomic situation.", "In the aftermath of the crisis, our biggest challenge has been to manage the tension between the demands of growth and of inflation.", "Even though we recovered from the crisis ahead of most other countries, inflation too caught up with us sooner than elsewhere.", "The tension that we need to manage is that economic growth requires that we maintain a low interest rate regime whereas inflation management warrants that we raise interest rates.", "In managing this tension, we are deeply conscious that inflation is a regressive tax that hurts the poor the most as their earnings are not protected against rising prices.", "You will of course have noted that as part of managing our growth-inflation dynamics in the post-crisis period, the Reserve Bank has raised policy interest rates seven times since March 2010.", "At the same time, we are sensitive to the need for supporting growth as economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction.", "Monetary policy making is always a challenge.", "The challenge has become even more complex in the globalizing world that we live in.", "How other countries, especially systemically important advanced economies, manage their monetary policies has implications for us and we need to take that into account in determining our own policy stance.", "Just to illustrate, the liquidity infusion policy of the US Fed, popularly known as quantitative easing (QE), has triggered larger capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs).", "This has in turn put upward pressure on EME exchange rates eroding their export competitiveness and pushing up asset prices.", "EMEs had to adjust their macroeconomic policies to manage the implications of these flows.", "I hope you now have a better understanding of the implications of the Reserve Bank's monetary policy for you at an individual and household level, and of the challenges that we address in formulating the policy.", "Regulation and supervision The Reserve Bank is the regulator and supervisor of banks, non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) and significant parts of the financial markets.", "In a market system, regulation is important in order to protect the interests of all stakeholders and to preserve financial stability.", "Let me explain both these objectives of regulation.", "The logic of protecting the interests of stakeholders is quite self-evident.", "Banks are the main conduits of financial intermediation in an economy - that is, banks take money from savers and lend it to borrowers keeping a margin for themselves to cover expenses and profits.", "This should ideally serve everyone's interest including that of the economy at large.", "However, the apprehension is that banks will overstep the limits of prudence in lending thereby jeopardizing the interests of the depositors.", "The task of regulation in this context is to ensure that banks stay within prudent limits in their financial intermediation role.", "Regulation is necessary also to ensure financial stability.", "Financial stability is notoriously difficult to define but we can easily tell when stability is disrupted, as happened during the recent crisis when financial markets went into a seizure.", "Financial stability gets disrupted when the fundamental macro variables such as the interest rate and the exchange rate get way out of alignment with economic fundamentals.", "We have all learnt from text books that the fundamental fulcrum of capitalism is a competitive market.", "We have also learnt that markets fail because the assumptions underlying competitive markets are very exacting and cannot be fully met in the real world.", "Financial markets are even more vulnerable to failure than markets for goods and services because of problems of information asymmetry, moral hazard, adverse selection and what have you.", "When financial markets fail, financial stability is impaired, and when that happens, it takes a devastating toll on economic growth and welfare.", "The purpose of regulation is to build in safeguards against failure of financial institutions and financial markets.", "Financial firms such as banks are different from non-financial firms, and financial markets are different from non-financial markets.", "The important difference is that financial firms are all interconnected, and a disruption in any one part of the system spreads rapidly through the entire system.", "Illustratively, a run on one bank could potentially trigger a run on other banks spreading and deepening the contagion.", "In contrast, the failure of a non-financial firm such as a manufacturing company hurts the company's equity holders and creditors but does not hurt people beyond that.", "We conduct bank regulation through a whole host of prescriptions.", "These prescriptions govern illustratively licencing of banks and their expansion through branch network, their corporate governance framework, the reserves they must maintain with the Reserve Bank, the type and quantum of capital they must hold and the way they must manage risk.", "Although, I have explained the concept with reference to banks, it applies equally to regulation of NBFCs, and other financial institutions.", "To ensure that banks comply with our regulations, we undertake periodic on-site inspections which are supplemented with off-site surveillance on an ongoing basis.", "We also hold periodic meetings with the top managements of banks to alert them to the bank's vulnerabilities and to sensitize them to our supervisory concerns.", "If the banks do not comply with the regulatory norms, the Reserve Bank has a range of supervisory powers in its armory: issuing cautionary letters and letters of displeasure, issuing directives to restrict business and imposition of financial penalties.", "The Reserve Bank is not the only regulator in the financial sector.", "There are other regulators too - such as, for example, SEBI which regulates the capital market, IRDA which regulates the insurance sector and the PFRDA which regulates the pension sector.", "A frequently asked question is whether the Reserve Bank regulates the rate of interest that must be paid on deposits or the interest that should be charged to borrowers.", "We used to do that but have almost entirely given it up as part of the reform process.", "Interest rates both to savers and borrowers now work on the market principle of competition among banks.", "As of now, only interest rates on NRI deposits and on savings bank accounts are administered.", "There is a view that we should deregulate the interest rate on savings bank accounts too.", "We are examining the pros and cons of doing that and will shortly put out a Discussion Paper for eliciting feedback.", "Regulation has both costs and benefits.", "Excessive or inappropriate regulation increases intermediation costs, impedes efficiency and stifles innovation.", "It can also result in regulatory arbitrage whereby financial operators evade stiff regulation by shifting operations to a lightly regulated regime.", "On the other hand, light regulation can cause financial instability and loss to some stakeholders at the expense of others.", "Financial regulation is an intensely analytical and intellectually challenging task.", "It requires sophisticated models and a good \"sense\" of the market since many of the risk indicators are not \"real time\".", "Regulators need to be intellectually agile and fastfooted in their responses.", "The challenge for the Reserve Bank, and indeed for all financial sector regulators, is to intelligently balance the costs and benefits of regulation and to do so in a dynamic sense as the market and macroeconomic circumstances are constantly evolving.", "External sector management The Reserve Bank shares the responsibility for the management of the external sector with the Government.", "The power for this is derived from the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 which is a successor to the earlier Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), Of all the different sectors of the economy, possibly the most extensive reforms have taken place in the external sector.", "Prior to 1991, India was one of the most closed economies in the world, and controls on foreign exchange transactions were near total.", "Today the situation is completely different.", "Now there are virtually no restrictions on current account transactions.", "Foreign exchange can easily be obtained for business expenses, travel, tourism, studies abroad, medical treatment, etc.", "In the pre-reform era, a licence had to be obtained for almost every type of import, and the import duties were prohibitive.", "Today, there are no quantitative restrictions and duties have been substantially slashed.", "Our liberalization has extended to the capital sector too.", "India's policy on foreign direct investment (FDI) is quite liberal and transparent.", "We allow foreign investment in almost all sectors except for a small negative list.", "Today, every resident Indian is allowed to take out up to $200,000 per financial year for any permitted current or capital account transaction under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme.", "Corporates can invest abroad up to 400 per cent of their net worth in Joint Ventures and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.", "India runs a current account deficit which means that we spend more foreign money on import of goods and services than we earn on exporting them.", "The gap between our spending and our earning has to be met by capital flows -
