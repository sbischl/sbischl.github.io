potential biases and lack of independence in expert views are issues that many respondents consider to be relevant.", "Trust is thus important, and trust needs to be earned.", "Trust also implies that citizens want a transparent and objective decision making process.", "[7] Therefore, we have taken the principles for evidence-based policy to heart and are working on operationalizing them in the policy areas for which we are responsible.", "Generally speaking, a lot has also happened with regard to evidence-based policy making over the past few years.", "Let me give you an example: Very nearby, the Halle Institute for Economic Research founded a Centre for Evidence-based Policy Advice (IWH-CEP) in 2014.", "This platform aims to create better foundations for the evaluation of policy measures, including the effects of regional policies.", "Research based on firm-level information on subsidies shows that such subsidies support the creation of new employment while the productivity of the recipient firms remains largely unaffected for the time span covered by the data.", "[8] Of course, this is only one of the many examples of how research institutes in Germany contribute to evidence-based policy- making.", "Moving on to the national level, the 2018 coalition agreement foresees an evaluation of policy measures in a wide range of areas such as integration in schools, traffic laws and fines, cultural policy, an initiative to promote healthy diets and increased physical activity, programs to prevent political extremism, as well as data protection regulation.", "[9] An important step towards operationalising policy evaluation and making it part of the policy process has been made by an initiative of the National Regulatory Control Council (Normenkontrollrat): Since March 2013, all national policy measures with annual implementation costs of more than \u20ac 1 million must be subject to ex post evaluation.", "These evaluations are reviewed by the Council.", "[10] Implementing these initiatives requires an active exchange between the fields of academia and policymaking, learning and experimenting.", "In order to promote this dialogue, the German National Academy of Sciences \"Leopoldina\" has established an initiative for evidence-based policy.", "[11] It aims to improve the transparency of political processes and to establish common standards on how policy measures should be evaluated.", "The initiative builds on an exchange of views between academia, administration, the media, and the political sphere through workshops, joint events, and (informal) networks.", "Another example of evidence-based policy comes from the international level: In 2017, the G20 endorsed a framework for the ex post evaluation of financial sector reforms.", "[12] In response to the global financial crisis, the G20 leaders agreed on a package of financial sector reforms with four elements: increasing resilience through higher capital requirements for banks, new regimes for the resolution of large and systemic banks, reforms of derivative markets, and improved monitoring and regulation of shadow banking.", "The objective of the evaluation framework is to attribute outcomes of reforms, to identify relevant heterogeneities with regard to reform effects, and to study broader, general equilibrium effects.", "First evaluations have already been conducted.", "They find that, by and large, the reforms are working as intended and do not have major side effects.", "In an ongoing evaluation project, the FSB members assess whether the reforms addressing the too-big-to-fail issue are reducing the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with systemically important banks.", "The evaluation projects benefit from academic support through dedicated academic advisors; input from stakeholders is actively sought through public consultations.", "Hence, you are all invited to engage!", "[13] What are the key lessons that we can take away from these examples of evidence-based policy?", "What are the elements of a good evaluation process?", "Institutional knowledge and methodological diversity are the basis for good policy evaluations.", "Sound, evidence-based policy making needs to be based on a range of studies and methods.", "Different empirical models which have been replicated across different markets and time periods can provide insight into the robustness of empirical findings.", "Repositories of evaluation studies can provide overviews of empirical work and also provide the basis for meta studies.", "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for example, has recently launched a repository of studies on the effects of banking regulation.", "[14] In addition to analytical and empirical methods, good identification requires information about the relevant institutional background.", "Not least, sustaining the political momentum requires evaluation to be embedded in a policy process.", "This creates the incentives for administrations to actively support evaluations, both internally and externally.", "Sound evidence-based policymaking requires high-quality data: Data are needed early on in the process of policy evaluation, as collecting relevant data ex post can prove costly and inefficient.", "The Bundesbank thus actively supports the provision of granular data for research purposes.", "The Bundesbank's Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) provides access to granular financial data.", "[15] At the moment, researchers involved in 125 projects are working with RDSC micro data.", "To further facilitate access to these data, the RDSC has recently opened another site at our regional office in Du\u0308sseldorf.", "Furthermore, the Bundesbank is supporting a RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) initiative to highlight the value of data in empirical work.", "[16] The idea of the initiative is to automate the search and discovery of datasets in the same way information on publications and citations can be collected.", "[17] In the context of improving the infrastructure for good data, let me take this opportunity to thank Regina Riphahn (University of Erlangen- Nuremberg) and Thomas Bauer (RWI Essen) for their work for the German Data Forum (Rat fu\u0308r So- zial- und Wirtschaftsdaten).", "Academic involvement is important: Causal identification of policy effects is at the heart of academic research.", "This is a very welcome development as it adds rigor, quality, and comparability to academic output.", "Yet, translating evidence based on causal identification strategies into sound policy advice requires much more: external validity and robustness of results over time and across different institutional setups is important.", "Adding such information and deriving broader policy implications from one's own work is not always rewarded by the academic community, though.", "Hence, we also need to think intelligently about ways to combine both - analytical rigor and quality controls with incentives to transfer knowledge from academia to policy.", "I would like to thank Stefan Bender, Manuel Buchholz, Philipp Marek, Christian Schumacher, Edgar Vogel, and Matthias Wei\u00df for most helpful contributions and comments on an earlier draft.", "All remaining errors and inconsistencies are my own.", "The European Systemic Risk Board is tasked with the macroprudential oversight of the financial system within the European Union; it can issue warnings and recommendations to mitigate systemic risks ( ).", "The ECB has the power to apply, if deemed necessary, more stringent measures than adopted nationally to address risks to financial stability ( -stability/macroprudentialmeasures/html/index.en.html ).", "Regarding macroprudential policy decisions, the Governing Council of the ECB is supported by the Financial Stability Committee (FSC), which comprises representatives of the ECB and national central banks and supervisory authorities ( ).", "See -statement-andstrategy/the-bundesbank-s-mission-statement-618248 5.", "See \"Leitlinien und Empfehlungen des Vereins fu\u0308r Socialpolitik fu\u0308r Ex post-Wirkungsanalysen\" as of 6 September, 2015 ( -Leitlinien_Ex_postWirkungsanalysen.pdf ) and Michael Burda, Monika Schnitzer, Bernd Fitzenberger, and Christoph Schmidt (2014), Evidenzbasierte Wirtschaftspolitik, Thesenpapier zur Kerntagung des Vereins fu\u0308r Socialpolitik in Hamburg 2014;
