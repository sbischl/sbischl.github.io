the year which started with the Eurosystem - that the annual rate of price increase, strongly influenced by developments in 1998, remained within the defined stability corridor at 1.1%.", "Since then, the price norm has not been met.", "In 2001, with Greece having joined the euro area, the figure was 2.5%.", "In the first nine months of this year, the rate was 2.2%.", "It is therefore no longer possible to speak of a short-term overshooting.", "In its defence, the ECB-council can point to a number of exceptional circumstances during the past few years - events over which the ECB has no influence and which have intensified upward pressure on prices.", "First, there have been, at times, sharp increases in international oil prices and thus also in European energy prices.", "Second, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease in addition to unfavourable weather conditions, especially in southern Europe, led to a considerable rise in food prices at the start of 2001 and in early 2002.", "Excluding the volatile components, energy and unprocessed food, the picture is significantly more favourable.", "In the current year, however, that figure will clearly be exceeded.", "All in all, the larger currency area has cushioned the substantial price shocks.", "Especially, no additional yield spreads have occurred.", "So far, the general expectation that the euro area, with a single currency and a single monetary policy, would see a rapid convergence of price developments has not been fulfilled.", "Since 1997, there has been a trend widening in the range of data from the individual countries.", "This indicates that specific, persistent, national factors continue to shape price developments.", "One reason for this may be seen in consumer habits, which vary from country to country.", "Another reason consists in diverging price trends, especially in the sector of non-tradable services or services of limited tradability.", "As a consequence, euro-area real rates of interest vary quite considerably.", "However, the national real interest rate is not the same for each sector.", "The relevant real interest rate differs according the different price developments.", "It is lower in the sector with higher sectoral inflation rates et vice versa.", "For the sector of tradables the real interest rates do not differ that much.", "European Economic and Monetary Union has a population of 300 million people.", "That is around 20 million more than in the United States.", "However, overall output in the euro area is almost 30% lower and per capita income as much as one-third lower than in the USA.", "In many instances, there were expectations that there would be a real convergence - in other words a reduction in the prosperity gap.", "The necessary strengthening of economic growth in the euro area - so it was hoped - would more or less occur automatically.", "In this context, reference was made, first, to the expansionary impact of interest rate convergence down to the lower German level in the run-up to Stage Three, which mainly benefited the former \"high interest rate\" countries.", "Second, it was expected that the introduction of a single currency would lead to a better allocation of the production factor capital as a result of the sudden improvement in capital market integration.", "Furthermore, an accelerated restructuring of the corporate landscape owing to an increased number of mergers and participations - added to more intense competition in the euro area - were supposed to act as a \"fitness programme\" for European enterprises.", "Significant positive growth effects were also forecast owing to the disappearance of the foreign exchange rate risk within the euro area.", "So far, however, those expectations have only just started to be fulfilled.", "On an average of the years since 1999, the rise in overall output in the euro area, at just over 2% annually, has been noticeably slower than in the USA (21\u20442%).", "The pace of expansion has also lagged behind that of the pre-ins, the United Kingdom and Sweden.", "The euro area has thus been unable to isolate itself from the cyclical slowdown in the USA, as had been hoped in early 2001.", "It has, in fact, more or less fully shadowed the price slumps on the US stock markets and the deterioration in sentiment of US investors and consumers, even though the bubble in the IT and telecoms sector was less pronounced here and the macroeconomic imbalances are less severe.", "The differential in per capita income compared with the United States - where the population is growing considerably more quickly than in the euro area - has been narrowing somewhat since 1999, however.", "But this development is due to the fact that the USA was hit harder by the cyclical slowdown than the euro area was.", "Looking at the longer-term trends, the US lead in potential growth over the euro area - which the IMF puts at 3\u20444 percentage point - is even larger than the difference in population growth.", "This means that, under these conditions, the per capita income between these two economic areas is even diverging.", "The euro area's growth performance has, on the whole, been unsatisfactory.", "This is revealed not least by the fact that EMU, despite some undeniable progress, still represents a quite heterogeneous economic area.", "This is shown by the wide spread of growth rates among the member countries.", "In 2000, for example, rates of growth ranged from just under 3% in Italy and Germany to 10% in Ireland.", "The differentials in growth across the euro-area countries did narrow in 2001 and 2002.", "However, a number of member countries converged on the low German pace of expansion -

including the largest economies in the euro area - have neglected to use the years of favourable cyclical development for consolidating their public finances.", "In many cases, welcome tax cuts were not adequately counter-financed by savings on the expenditure side, which led to a further deterioration in the underlying budgetary position.", "Together with cyclically induced strains, this has resulted in a situation where those countries are now finding it difficult to comply with - or are already overshooting - the 3% deficit ratio limit.", "Germany is among these countries.", "The EU-commission has already implemented the excessive deficit procedure.", "The fiscal policy problems of some countries have occasioned a debate on possible changes to the Stability and Growth Pact, implying a softening of its terms.", "This would, however, jeopardise the objective of sound underlying fiscal policy conditions, which are a major and essential component of a monetary policy that is geared to stability.", "In order to preserve the credibility of the fiscal policy ground rules in the monetary union, what those countries need to do instead is undertake a speedy correction of the undesirable developments that have emerged and achieve structurally balanced budgets in the near future.", "This will make it easier for the European Central Bank to perform its task of maintaining price stability.", "Sound public finances, moreover, contribute to sustained economic growth and a longterm increase in employment.", "Over the past four years, the Governing Council of the ECB has demonstrated that it takes its stability mandate seriously.", "With its consistent and forward-looking monetary policy, the Governing Council has succeeded in anchoring inflation expectations at the targeted low level.", "That success is all the more notable in view of the fact that price developments in the euro area since January 1999 have been shaped, as described earlier, by a series of negative shocks.", "In terms of its monetary policy strategy, the ECB Governing Council has repeatedly had to contend with the accusation of a lack of transparency.", "Criticism was mainly aroused by the unclear weighting of the two pillars in the event of conflict.", "The ECB has now improved its communication with the markets to the extent that its interest rate decisions are, as a rule, correctly anticipated by the markets.", "But it still has to be said that the two-pillar strategy, owing to its complexity, makes heavy demands on the Eurosystem's communications policy.", "Following a two pillar strategy the ECB council does neither ignore the possible threats by monetary expansion nor does he feel bound by monetary orthodoxy.", "It is true, that inflation is a monetary phenomenon.", "However, that holds only in the long run.", "For the short term inflation is also determined by a couple of non-monetary variables.", "In addition, growth of monetary aggregates can be disturbed by special determinants such as portfolio effects.", "Therefore, there suitability as indicators may suffer.", "As a consequence, the ECB-Council pursues a more broadly based approach.", "A second pillar is added.", "In monitoring the price developments and determinants the ECB-council judges the inflation expectations over the medium term.", "For the euro-area financial markets, the introduction of the euro has had far-reaching implications.", "These include, in particular, the rapid convergence of the national markets to form a fully integrated euro money market, the strong growth in the market for euro-denominated corporate bonds as well as the wave of consolidation in the case of banks and stock exchanges.", "It has gradually become apparent, however, that a complete integration of the financial systems is currently still hindered by a large number of regulatory, tax and legal obstacles and eliminating those obstacles is proving to be complex and arduous.", "The Lamfalussy proposals are designed to accelerate that process.", "Let me now turn to more practical aspects of the Monetary Union.", "That is by no means a matter of course.", "The introduction of workable common instruments for monetary policy, the proper functioning of payment systems and the harmonisation of statistical methodologies are crucial to the success of the monetary union.", "Most important among the technical aspects managed by the Eurosystem was, of course, the smooth introduction of euro banknotes and coins as sole legal tender.", "The 2002 cash changeover proved to be a formidable challenge for cash management and communication departments.", "The legacy currencies were withdrawn from about 300 million Europeans as well as from outside the euro area, where especially D-Mark was in circulation.", "At the same time, the new currency was issued.", "To meet this challenge, a long and thorough preparation took place.", "The general framework for the changeover - including national changeover scenarios - was agreed at the European level as early as 1999 and 2000.", "Close collaboration with third parties - mainly banks, retailers and manufacturers of cash handling machines - was initiated at an early stage.", "The withdrawal of national currency started in mid-2001.", "An award-winning campaign under the title \"Don't let sleeping coins lie\", the Bundesbank called upon the general public to hand in unused coins hidden in piggy banks, under pillows or among their socks.", "By November 2001, we had already collected more than 20% of all coins in circulation.", "Of course, a substantial amount of D-Mark is still in circulation.", "In comparison to December 2000 almost 4% of all D-Mark banknotes are in circulation.", "Some of it may never come back.", "However, the Bundesbank has committed itself to exchanging D-Mark banknotes for an indefinite period.", "The logistical preparations for the introduction of euro banknotes and coins cash proved equally successful.", "In order to smooth the final changeover, the banks were supplied with notes and coins in advance (front-loading).", "The banks, in turn, provided retailers with the new cash - a process known as sub-frontloading.", "Of course, special debiting models had to be applied for the credit institutions in order to limit the costs they incurred in the changeover.", "In addition, a set of coins worth about 10 euro (starter kits) was sold to the general public around Christmas time in order to familiarise them with the new coins and provide them with the small change that they would need early in the new year.", "Euro cash was put into circulation and change in euro was given from the very first few days of 2002 onwards.", "By 4 p.m. on 2 January, an average of 92% of automated teller machines had been converted to dispense euro notes across the 12 countries.", "Moreover, the new cash rapidly gained overwhelming acceptance.", "The old currencies were therefore withdrawn much more quickly than expected.This also led to an exceptionally high demand for low-denomination euro banknotes and coins and even caused some short-term bottlenecks.", "Besides the logistical challenge, the changeover called for major efforts in communication.", "Every man and woman and child had to be familiarised with the new currency.", "That meant, at the very least, their denomination, appearance and security features.", "Equally, we were reluctant to make the security features known too early because of the potential threat of counterfeiting.", "And indeed, we do have some indications that the euro as a leading currency is more subject to counterfeiters than the former national currencies of smaller countries.", "Hitherto, in Germany the number counterfeited euro banknotes is limited and lower than before.", "Therefore, the tremendous efforts to prevent counterfeiting proved worthwhile.", "All major instruments of communication policy were used.", "The information campaign provided the general public with details of the new banknotes and coins.", "There was close cooperation with the press and the mass media.", "Of course, the differing information needs of the general public and of professional cash handlers (banks, retailers) had be taken into consideration.", "Opinion leaders were informed and cash handlers were trained in working with the euro cash in advance.", "All accounting systems and each cash point had to be made ready for the new currency and the dual circulation period.", "As things turned out, the two-month dual circulation period was, if anything, too long.", "The changeover had given rise to fears of inflation There were three main aspects to this.", "First, there was the possibility that businesses might try to recoup their changeover costs by putting up prices.", "Second, businesses might defer scheduled price increases until after the changeover owing to the need to display prices in the new currency.", "Third, price increases might occur owing to rounding differences.", "However, the changeover itself did not have a major impact on consumer prices.", "Many consumer goods were subject to automatic conversion since they are paid by standing order out of a bank account.", "Nevertheless, even almost a year after the changeover, perceived inflation diverges significantly from the actual low rate of inflation.", "Consumers perceive inflation to be much higher and react accordingly.", "They attach greater importance to price developments in goods and services which they buy more frequently and pay for in cash.", "However, the harmonised indicator of consumer prices does cover a broad basket of goods.", "Higher perceived inflation occurred first in Germany but in the course of this year also in other member countries.", "The Governing Council of the ECB keeps a close watch on the development of perceived inflation -
