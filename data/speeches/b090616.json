course, a well-suited role for the IMF given its global reach and infrastructure.", "So far, the IMF has announced a series of measures, which revisited its traditional credit practices and created new credit lines, such as the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF).", "These are welcomed steps but also \"baby\" steps.", "As long as a comprehensive set of products for

outflows that are unrelated to their economic fundamentals, among others.", "It is not a matter of chance that so many bilateral swaps agreements between Central Banks emerged during the crisis.", "It is a natural response of the system to the lacking of an international provider of liquidity of last resort going forward.", "In my view, while this is very welcomed, the arrangements are not enough it terms of size and length to provide an alternative to self-insurance via foreign reserve accumulation.", "In fact, the development of all of the bilateral agreements and the regional initiatives such as Chiang Mai just prove the need for international cooperation in a context of an absence of a multilateral organization in a position to perform as a kind of \"central bank of the central banks\".", "This is the next step we need to go for.", "And for this to happen, the role of the G-20 is critical.", "So far, the group has managed to build consensus on the relevant issues and has been able to make some progress both in the reform of the international financial architecture (expansion of the FSF and the Basel Committee, the capitalization of the IMF, revisiting of the IMF international lender of last resort role, and speeding up the governance reform process of the IFIs) and in coordinating macroeconomic policy responses to the crisis.", "One of the key challenges the G-20 faces going forward is to consolidate as a formal body.", "That means not only to propose changes to reform of the international financial architecture but also, and most importantly, to systematically monitor its degree of implementation.", "The next meeting is going to be essential to assess the degree of progress in the implementation of the course of action set forth.", "In my view, the creation of the FSB has been the most significant reform in the international financial architecture so far.", "The FSB will play a key role in the new international financial architecture.", "It will be responsible for coordinating banking regulation, developing regulatory and supervisory standards, preparing early warning reports and exchanging information with supervisors.", "Enhanced representation will increase the likelihood of effective implementation of standards and will hike the quality of standards.", "For instance, in the case of the regulatory treatment of currency mismatches, we, I mean those countries that suffered significant macroeconomic crisis, have some experience to share.", "The increased credit risk faced by subsidiaries, when these subsidiaries are significant for the banking group as a whole, imposes significant negative effects for the parent bank and home financial market.", "Central Banks could strengthen its regulation on credit risk management by requiring banks that before granting a loan, they should assure that no currency mismatches exist in debtors' balance sheets.", "This regulation can be imposed by host authorities to subsidiaries in their jurisdictions, and also, by home regulators to the banking group as a whole regarding each of its subsidiaries.", "This means for example that home regulators ask that the parent bank and each subsidiary inside the group must comply with that requirement.", "If not, penalties should be imposed, such as increases in capital requirements.", "The effect of that kind of currency mismatches could be explicitly considered in the Pilar II of the Basel II Agreement.", "If the effect of currency mismatches are not properly attended by banks, supervisors at the banking group level, should require additional capital to attend the potential effect, at the banking group level, of the worsening of debtors \u0301 income in hosts markets, and therefore, in subsidiaries capital position and then, in parent bank capital positions.", "Also, the potential effects of currency mismatches should be explicitly addressed in supervisory colleges.", "Credit risk transfer is another key aspect of the agenda.", "Instead of reducing systemic risks, Credit Default Swaps have contributed to raising them.", "Risk is not always shifted to the parties that are best able to bear it, but to those subject to laxer regulatory constraints.", "Another topic important to highlight, because of its relevance for emerging markets economies, is the lack of transparency and absence of reliable statistics in the OTC derivatives markets for non-financial corporations.", "This opacity left policy-makers without information about exposures on OTC transactions done with foreign financial institutions.", "As we know, the consequences of these exposures in some emerging markets were systemically important and central banks had to provide financial assistance to the market, to avoid major financial distress.", "We must work towards encouraging the trading of credit derivatives using electronic platforms or regulated exchanges and the clearing of standardized credit derivatives through a central counterparty.", "This would help to reduce risk, in part by allowing for the multilateral netting of outstanding notional amounts, and, on the other hand, by the requirement of posting collateral.", "However, if central banks promote its usage they should be prepared to provide it with access to central bank credit facilities, or to provide liquidity by other means in case of need.", "A macro-prudential approach recommends that regulators and supervisors should consider potential systemic risk and the vulnerabilities of the environment in which financial institutions act.", "It will be fundamental to understand the interaction that exists between the financial system and the real economy.", "This approach will demand greater cooperation between local and external regulators, requiring them to develop an integrated picture of the financial system, considering not just banks, but also all financial institutions.", "The analysis of macroeconomic vulnerabilities that could subsequently impact on financial system liquidity or solvency should also be embedded in the regulatory framework.", "Deviations should be analyzed in relation to the long-term trends for certain variables, such as credit to GDP ratio, assets prices (residential and commercial property, shares and government securities, and currencies), the exchange rate equilibrium (real/effective) and the international capital flows, among others.", "To sum up, we can expect that financial markets are going to be different going forward.", "The former market based financial system should be brought down the umbrella of prudential regulation avoiding regulatory arbitrage.", "However, this could lead to a time of slower credit expansion given that higher leverage in that sector allowed faster credit expansion which is alleged to underlay faster growth rates.", "So once again, preventing a credit market bubble calls for tougher surveillance on this kind of financial agents, but at the same time we should be careful not to choke productivity growth.", "In this financial framework, Central Banks duties should be also rethink particularly regarding the ability to be lender of last resort to non-bank financial institutions.", "But something that we can be sure of is that a stable global financial market would reduce the \"parking\" of liquidity leaving the possibility of diverting resources to be more efficiently allocated, helping our countries to keep catching up with the needed development of our societies."], "classifications":
