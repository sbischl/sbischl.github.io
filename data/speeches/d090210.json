of poverty.", "I am hopeful that the global economy will emerge fitter from this crisis.", "But there are no quick fixes.", "The ability of Mauritius and other small states to elude the immediate impact of the crisis can be put down to two broad factors; first: avoiding the worst aspects of global credit delinquency through appropriate banking regulation and supervision; second: stability and probity in accounting and banking methods, recognising risks for what they are, and reducing exposure to potential losses, rather than grabbing gold-plated opportunities for making a fast buck.", "In 2007, we launched a new strategy for communication which culminated in the End-of-Year Stakeholders.", "The essential idea here is to share with you the experiences of the Bank of Mauritius, the highs

exceptional measures to protect our economy from the effects of the global turmoil.", "At the Bank, we have stepped up our vigilance and taken prompt action to sustain investor confidence and long-term financial stability by tasking a special multi-divisional cell, comprising senior officers from various disciplines, to monitor closely the evolution of the crisis.", "In the midst of all these uncertainties, I must admit we have also been lucky.", "Our banking system has been steady and stable throughout the year, maintaining strong capital buffers and high solvency ratios, all of which have ensured its resilience.", "The judicious lending and investment practices of our banks have protected them from exposure to the toxic assets and complex derivative products fatally linked to the US sub-prime credits and the over-valuation of real estate.", "A key element in the soundness of our banking practices has been our greater reliance on deposit funding rather than on money market or external funding.", "These classic and simple safety measures have kept us relatively unaffected by the global financial crisis.", "If banking has remained safe and secure in Mauritius, what can we say of the wider aspects of the domestic economy?", "Or, in U.S parlance, what about Main Street?", "Mauritius has not of course entirely escaped the spillover effects of the global crisis on

million.", "This allowed local banks to maintain the flow of credit for international trade, which is a vital lifeline for an open economy like ours.", "Regulation and supervision The flaws in the national regulatory systems of the major economies have been cruelly exposed by the global crisis and its attendant financial scandals.", "Effective and timely regulation, built on prudent, transparent and sound supervisory practices, must be at the heart of a stable financial system.", "In the course of last year, the Bank reviewed its supervisory structures and revisited most of its regulatory guidelines to ensure that the supervision of the banking sector remains ahead of the game and meets a high standard when gauged by international norms.", "(Click here for further details on

of our enabling Act.", "As I mentioned Financial Stability Report provides a useful communication in the Foreword of the FSR, \"The tool about existing and potential future risks to financial

banking policies and practices with the level of financial access in the selected countries, had its world-wide launch at the Bank of Mauritius Headquarters in November 2008.", "The exceptional capital inflows at the beginning of 2008, to which I alluded earlier, put significant pressure on monetary matters for our small economy.", "They cause the rupee to appreciate and fuelled the rising rate of price inflation, already affected by the unprecedented spike in oil prices and the steady increase in prices of food and commodities.", "The Bank was therefore confronted with the combined challenge of combating inflation and preserving the competitiveness of the export-oriented sectors.", "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), normally set to meet on a quarterly basis, met eight times in 2008 with interim meetings having to be called to deal with rapidly-changing conditions.", "(Click here for further details on the work of the Monetary Policy Committee) With rising inflation, the Bank continued with its tight monetary policy in the first quarter of 2008.", "Unpredictable developments on the international scene in the second quarter, coupled with our own projected inflation, compelled the Bank to ease its stance a little in the second quarter.", "An expansionary budget, handed down in June 2008, coupled with a generous wage-award for the civil service which raised the

fertile ground for lobbyists and other pressure groups to seek to influence outcomes in their favour.", "In addition to the interest rate decisions of the MPC, the Bank had recourse to other tools to respond to abnormal monetary and credit conditions.", "Owing to structural excess liquidity in the system, the overnight rate had remained persistently outside its set limits (the corridor) since the framework was introduced in December 2006.", "The Bank increased the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) from 4 per cent to 6 per cent in August.", "This resulted in the rate falling rapidly back within the limits of the corridor.", "However, in view of the rapidly-changing global environment, the Bank subsequently reduced the CRR first to 5 per cent and then to 4.5 per cent in December, to ensure that the system had sufficient liquidity.", "Another measure that I considered necessary in the circumstances was the widening of the corridor from the symmetric band of 50 basis points to a band of 125 basis points around the Key Repo Rate.", "(Click here for further details on other measures aimed at strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework) When we compare with many other emerging economies, which are as dependent on imports as Mauritius, we have little reason to be too unhappy as we have managed to keep inflation at reasonable levels.", "And this year, we have the extra burden of having

in the foreign exchange market.", "This reflected rapid and substantial global fluctuations.", "The Bank intervened regularly on the market and by the end of the year, we succeeded in significantly dampening volatility.", "(Click here for further details on Intervention on the Foreign Exchange Market) There have been different views, some quite vociferous, on how \"weak\" or how \"strong\" the rupee should be, depending from which side of the market one is operating.", "Any orchestration of demand for a central-bank-led depreciation of the Mauritian Rupee fails to appreciate the serious ill effects of a highly devalued currency for a small import-dependent open economy like ours.", "Its consequences could be disastrous if a self-accentuating expectation is fuelled with instant pass-through into domestic inflation.", "The Bank believes that both sellers and buyers should get a fair price.", "One way of achieving this is by reducing the cost of intermediation.", "The Bank has been addressing this in two ways.", "First, the Bank has agreed to buy and sell foreign currency directly in a structured manner from/to those in the market that have, or require them, in large quantities.", "Second, with a view to spurring greater competition, the Bank issued licences to 14 new Money Changers and one Foreign Exchange Dealer on a revised set of conditions.", "Whilst the Bank

shareholders and two others merged into one, leading to three new names being added to the list of operating banks, while four were de-listed.", "Whereas the current trend worldwide is to effectively nationalise banks as part of the response to the credit crunch, in Mauritius we have the reverse situation - the public sector selling its majority interest in one of the banks to private sector operators.", "Strengthening of interaction with the banking industry At the apex level, collaboration between commercial banks and the Bank occurs through the quarterly Banking Committee meetings in which Chief Executives of all banks and the Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA) participate.", "The Banking Committee is not confined to supervision and regulation alone but covers the entire gamut of
